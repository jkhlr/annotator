Nawabzada Mirza Jamiluddin Ahmad Khan was born to a literary family in Delhi, India on 20 January 1925. His father Amiruddin Ahmed Khan was Nawab of Loharu and his mother Syeda Jamila Baigum was direct descendant of Khwaja Mir Dard and was the fourth wife of Amiruddin Khan. Aali earned a BA in Economics from Anglo Arabic College, Delhi in 1944. In 1947 after the partition of India, Aali migrated to Karachi, Pakistan on 13 August 1947 with his family and started his career as an assistant in the Ministry of Commerce. In 1951, Aali passed CSS (civil service of Pakistan) examination and joined Pakistan Taxation Service. He was also the Officer on Special Duty at President House from 1959 to 1963. Aali joined the National Bank of Pakistan in 1967 and remained its vice president until his retirement in 1988. In 1971, he obtained an FEL and LLB (law) degrees from University of Karachi. Jamiluddin Aali was also former member of the Pakistan Peoples Party and was compelled to contest the 1977 National Assembly elections from NA-191, but lost to Munawwar Hasan of Jamaat-e-Islami. In 1997, Aali was elected as the member of the Senate for a six-year term with support of Muttahida Qaumi Movement. Jamiluddin Aali was never very clear or comfortable with answering the question as to why he drifted briefly into politics. Was it due to his impulsive behavior for fame and recognition? He would usually evade this question and never could answer it comfortably and clearly during his lifetime. Aali started composing poetry at an early age and wrote many books as well as songs. He wrote the song \"Jeevay Jeevay Pakistan\" during 1965 Indo-Pak war which became highly popular. The song was sung by Shahnaz Begum with music arranged by Sohail Rana and was originally released on 14 August 1971 by PTV. During International Women's Year (1976), he wrote the song \"Hum Maain, Hum Behnain, Hum Baitiyan\". Aali also wrote a song \"Jo Nam Wohi Pehchan, Pakistan\" at the request of former Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1986. He was also the writer of the song \"Mera Inam Pakistan\" by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Jamiluddin Aaali was married in 1944 to Tayyba Bano. He had three sons and two daughters. Aali was suffering from diabetes and respiratory illness and was admitted in a hospital in Karachi. He died of heart attack on 23 November 2015 in Karachi. His Namaz-I-Janazah was held in the mosque \"Tooba\" in DHA, Karachi. He was laid to rest in an army graveyard Bizerta Lines, Karachi on 23 November 2015. Jamiluddin Aali took over as honorary secretary of the Anjuman-i Taraqqi-i Urdu (Association for the Promotion of Urdu language) in 1962 after the death of Baba-e-Urdu Maulvi Abdul Haq and played a key role there for many years, along with Farman Fatehpuri, to ensure that the association survives and grows. Aali could also be given credit for playing a major role at the Urdu Lughat Board (Urdu Dictionary Board) when this 22-volume Urdu dictionary was being developed in Pakistan.

Aantjes a jurist by occupation, was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 26 May 1959 after the general election of 1959. He served as the Parliamentary leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the House of Representatives from 22 June 1971 until 30 November 1972, during the period when Barend Biesheuvel the Leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Aantjes became Leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party and Parliamentary leader on 7 March 1973 and served until 25 May 1977 when the became the Parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal in the House of Representatives of the Netherlands from 19 December 1977 until 7 November 1978 when he resigned both his positions. Willem Aantjes was born on 16 January 1923 in Bleskensgraaf in the Netherlands Province of South Holland. His father, Klaas Aantjes', was alderman in Bleskensgraaf and from 1 October 1950 to 14 January 1951 mayor of Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht. His brother Jan Aantjes was also mayor of several municipalities. Aantjes attended the Marnix Gymnasium in Rotterdam. On 8 February 1940, Aantjes started to work for the postal mail company PTT. On 19 July 1943, he was selected for Arbeitseinsatz and sent to G\u00fcstrow to deliver mail. Aantjes would later say he had not refused selection, because the board of PTT would otherwise have sent a married employee in his place. In September 1944, Aantjes wanted to return to the Netherlands. Other Dutch forced laborers told him that if one joined the Germanic SS, one could ask for an assignment in the Netherlands and be trained as a police officer on the Avegoor estate near Ellecom. Aantjes decided he would follow this route, and enlisted in the Germanic SS. To his dismay, he was assigned to Landstorm Nederland, a division of the Waffen-SS and he received a uniform. After being transferred to Hoogeveen, Aantjes refused to wear the uniform and to enlist in Landstorm Nederland. He was arrested and imprisoned in Port Natal near Assen, an abandoned psychiatric hospital that had been turned into a work camp by the Nazis. After the war ended in May 1945, Aantjes enrolled at the University of Utrecht to study law. He never mentioned his enlisting in the Germaanse-SS to anyone. Aantjes became a member of the House of Representatives for the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) in 1959. He was offered the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment in 1967. He turned it down, because several party members knew enough about his war past to object to his candidacy in public. On 6 July 1971, Aantjes became leader of the ARP group. Aantjes played an important part in the merger of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP), the Christian Historical Union (CHU) and the Catholic People's Party (KVP) into the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). His address to the first joint congress of the three parties, which was held in 1975, has become known as the \"Sermon on the Mount\". After the general election of 1977, Aantjes was offered the Ministry of Justice in the first cabinet of Prime Minister Dries van Agt. Again, Aantjes refused, and used his continuing involvement in the development of the CDA party as reason for his refusal. He then became the first leader of the CDA party in the House of Representatives on 20 December 1977. In 1978, Loe de Jong of the Dutch Institute for War Documentation was confronted with stories about Aantjes's alleged sympathies for Nazism. Although the Institute usually did not respond to such rumors, De Jong - considering the high position of Aantjes - believed that further investigation was necessary. His staff discovered a note, which showed that Aantjes was mobilized in October 1944 as part of the Waffen-SS. On 6 November 1978, Loe de Jong of the Dutch Institute for War Documentation announced in a press conference that Aantjes had signed up for the Waffen-SS in World War II, and that he had been a camp guard in Port Natal. Aantjes, at that time leader of the CDA party in the House of Representatives, resigned his position as parliamentary party leader and member of the House of Representatives the next day. Aantjes argued he had joined the Germanic SS because he believed that this was the only legal way to escape from forced labor in G\u00fcstrow. While De Jong assumed that Aantjes had joined the Germanic SS out of mere opportunism or sympathy for the Nazi ideology or the Dutch collaborating fascist National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands, Aantjes said this was not the case. A later investigation showed that Aantjes was right and had instead been interned at Port Natal, and De Jong admitted to have made mistakes. The affair was publicly seen as a way to get rid of Aantjes by his political rivals. Official(in Dutch) Mr. W.

He was suspected of having organized multiple terror attacks in Belgium and France, and is known to have masterminded the November 2015 Paris attacks. Prior to the Paris attacks, there was an international arrest warrant issued for Abaaoud for his activities in recruiting individuals to Islamic terrorism in Syria. Abaaoud was also known as Abu Omar Soussi (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0633\u064a\u200e, meaning \"Abu Omar of Sous\", his Moroccan family's place of origin) and as Abu Omar al-Balj\u012bk\u012b (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062c\u064a\u0643\u064a\u200e, meaning Abu Omar of Belgium), both of which were noms de guerre. Abdelhamid, one of six children, was born on 8 April 1987 in Anderlecht, a municipality of Brussels, Belgium. He was the son of Omar Abaaoud, who emigrated to Belgium from Morocco in 1975. Omar Abaaoud's first employment after emigration was in mining, before he was employed as a shopkeeper. Abaaoud grew up in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, an area in Brussels where \"the radical Salafist ideology has flourished among some young Muslims. \" He attended the select Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Pierre in Uccle from 1999 to 2000. An article from 2015 said childhood friends claimed Abaaoud had smoked \"a lot of cannabis\" during his teenage years. Both Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam were arrested during December 2010 for attempting to break into a parking garage, according to the lawyer representing Abaaoud. Abaaoud alone had spent time in at least three prisons, and had a number of arrests for assault, and other crimes. The nature of these latter crimes were not disclosed by his lawyer. For a time, sometime prior to 2013, Abdelhamid Abaaoud was involved in trading via employment with his father. In 2013, he recruited his then 13-year-old brother Younes to join him in Syria. They left for Syria on 19 January 2014, for which he was convicted of abduction, having been previously convicted of robbery. Abaaoud is reported to have joined a group within ISIL known as al-Battar Katiba, (the al-Battar Battalion) during the fight against Bashar al-Assad in 2013. He returned to Belgium by the end of the same year. In 2014, independent journalists \u00c9tienne Huver and Guillaume Lhotellier visited the Syria\u2013Turkey border, where they obtained photos and video of Abaaoud's time in Syria. One portion of this material showed Abaaoud and others loading bloody corpses into a truck and trailer before Abaaoud grinned and told the camera: \"Before we towed jet skis, motorcycles, quad bikes, big trailers filled with gifts for vacation in Morocco. Now, thank God, following God's path, we're towing apostates, infidels who are fighting us. \" Within Syria, Abaaoud is known to have been active at Hraytan. A diary entry while there records: \"Admittedly there is no joy in spilling blood, although it's nice to see, from time to time, the blood of the infidels\". Analysis of a telephone call established Abaaoud was in contact with Mehdi Nemmouche during January 2014. Nemmouche, a Franco-Algerian jihadist, shot and killed four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels on 24 May 2014. Belgian authorities suspect him of having helped to organize and finance a terror cell in Verviers. This cell was raided on 15 January 2015 and two members of the cell were killed. In an interview with Dabiq, the magazine of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), Abaaoud bragged on social media about going to Belgium to lead the cell but escaped back to Syria, even being stopped by a police officer who compared him to a photo but did not identify him. In July 2015, following the Verviers raid, he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to twenty years in prison by a Belgian judge for organizing terrorism. In an interview with Dabiq magazine published February 2015, Abaaoud was reported to have made comments of his intention to fight persons of the Western world which he identifies as \"the crusaders\". Abaaoud was put under investigation as a possible link to four out of six attacks foiled in France since spring 2015. This included an attempted attack by Sid Ahmed Ghlam at a church in Villejuif near Paris in April 2015, as well as the thwarted Thalys train attack, which occurred on 21 August 2015. According to a BBC report on 19 November 2015, after Abaaoud's death, France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters that he had received intelligence that Abaaoud passed through Greece on his return from Syria. It is unclear whether the Belgian had concealed himself among the thousands of migrants arriving in Greece before heading for other EU nations. Greek officials subsequently insisted that there was no evidence that Abaaoud had been in that country. Confirming that Abaaoud had left for Syria last year, Cazeneuve said no EU states had signalled his return. By 16 November 2015, French and Belgian security services were focused on Abaaoud, who they believed to have been the leader of the Paris attacks. On 18 November, French authorities conducted a raid that ended in the injury of five police officers, three deaths, and at least five arrests, although some reports later indicated eight. The raid took place in the suburb of Saint-Denis in north Paris, and targeted Abaaoud. He was later confirmed to be one of the three fatalities in the raid. The police were aware that Hasna Ait Boulahcen, a suspect in a drug ring investigation during which her telephone was tapped, also of Moroccan origin, was an associate of Abaaoud. They followed her to a Saint-Denis apartment building at 8 Rue Corbillon on 17 November and saw Abaaoud entering with her. This was the building where the subsequent raid started at 4:20 am on 18 November. The prosecutor's office said that Abaaoud's body was found in the apartment that had been targeted in the raid and that the identification was made using skin samples, according to some published reports. However, other reports referred to identification by fingerprint samples taken from Abaaoud's mutilated body which had been riddled with bullets and bits of shrapnel from a grenade explosion. Abaaoud's fingerprints were found on an AK-47 rifle found in an abandoned car. According to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, Abaaoud had \"played a decisive role\" in the Paris attacks and played a part in four of six terror attacks foiled since spring of 2015, with one alleged jihadist claiming Abaaoud had trained him personally. The French prosecutor also stated on 24 November that Abaaoud was planning another attack in La D\u00e9fense, a major business district in the Paris Metropolitan Area. West Midlands Police also recovered nearly 50 video clips and digital photographs from his phone. Among the photos were those of the Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham and other locations in the city. Abaaoud had visited the United Kingdom in August 2015. He arrived at Dover by ferry despite being hunted by Belgian authorities. Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam were in prison together in Belgium. Abaaoud was apparently connected to Sharia4Belgium. Abaaoud was thought by counter-terrorism officials to have been close to Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi, and the link between ISIL leadership in Syria and terror cells operating in Europe. He was also connected to Charaffe al Mouadan, who was based in Syria and a participating member of ISIS prior to his death on 24 December. On 5 December, officials confirmed Abaaoud had two connections living in the Bordesley Green and Alum Rock areas of Birmingham, England. E.

He was murdered in 2015. George Abanga was born on August 4, 1976. He had a daughter named Emefa and a wife whose name is unidentified. Abanga was murdered at age 39. George Abanga began as a tailor, but later moved to radio to become a serial caller. For ten years, he was a reporter at Success FM in Goaso. He was also a correspondent for Peace FM in Accra. Abanga's reporting could have been a factor in his murder. He had just reported issues concerning some of the cocoa farmers from Sankore. There had been theft of fertilizers in that area. He had also recently reported some regional political tensions. Police have connected some of Abanga's work to his death. On September 10, 2015, George Abanga was murdered on his drive home after reporting a theft of fertilizer in Sankore in the Brong-Ahafo Region. His attackers had the road blocked off. His left arm was shot, close to the shoulder. None of his belongings were taken, which led the investigators to believe that the murder was related to his journalist work and was not a robbery. At the time of his death, he had a wallet, containing GHS 160 in Ghanaian currency, two mobile phones, and a motorcycle. After the shooting, he was taken to the District Hospital in Goaso. He was declared dead upon arrival at the hospital. The police issued the following statement after Abanga was killed: \"We cannot suspect robbery at the moment. Also he is not around to tell us what happened; that is why we are treating this as murder. \"The suspect who confessed to the crime was a man in his mid-40s. Although the motive was not determined, the man confessed because he said he believed Abanga's ghost was chasing him. The motive of Abanga's murderers was hard for investigators to determine. The police believed that the murder was connected to Abanga's stories about stolen fertilizers from cocoa farmers in the area. It could also have been connected to his reporting on the political problems with the President John Dramani Mahama's National Democratic Congress. Editor at Success FM Atiewin Mohammed suspected a different story to be the reasoning behind Abanga's murder. Abanga had reported on the National Democratic Congress political party. Some of the members from Asibrem demanded the sack of some of the members of the party. This political story could have been another motive for the murder. Abanga had also led a protest of nine followers of the National Democratic Congress. He had stated that the LESDEP planners took their money to provide them with tricycles but nothing was delivered. Another possible explanation for his death was that the armed attackers had mistaken him for a cocoa purchaser whom they had been chasing to rob. Violence against reporters is uncommon in Ghana, which made this case unusual. Of the journalists worldwide killed in 2015, two-thirds of them were murdered as a direct result of their work. In 2015, South Sudan, Poland, and Ghana made it onto the Committee to Protect Journalists' (CPJ) killed database for the first time. George Abanga was just one of the many journalists who were killed due to their profession. The most common reporting topics that led to journalists being attacked or killed dealt with politics, then war and human rights. The Concerned Youth of Asunafo South has stated that people have been targeted and killed while law enforcers haven't done much to investigate and catch the criminals. They have tried to spread awareness about this issue. Reminding law enforcers of this issue may help save other journalists' lives.

Abbas served as vice president, minister of defence, minister of health, minister of communications and transport and commander in chief of the armed forces of Sudan. He is recognised for his intelligence although he remained silent and peaceful all his life. Abbas rose to prominence as a result of his involvement in the 1969 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat, following which he became the Deputy Chairman of the ruling National Revolutionary Command Council. Abbas was appointed as Minister of Defense on 29 October 1969 following a cabinet reshuffle implemented to strengthen the army's control over the Sudanese government. Abbas, an anti-Mahdist and non-communist, was given the role. As Defense Minister he, alongside Babiker, would push Nimeiry to adopt a more aggressive response to the rising threat to the government posed by the Ansar movement, resulting in the brutal crackdown seen on Aba Island in 1970. Abbas's tenure also saw the attempted 1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat, during which his younger brother was killed. The RCC was disbanded following the 1971 coup attempt at Abbas's insistence, and Nimeiry instead assumed the title of President in September 1971.

A former member of the Lavender Menace, she co-authored Sappho Was a Right-on Woman: A Liberated View of Lesbianism and was one of the most vocal and active members in the National Organization for Women, helping the organization to focus on not just women's rights in general, but lesbian rights, as well. Sidney Afton Abbott was born in 1937 into a military family, describing herself as a military brat. She attended Smith College for three years, and graduated from the University of New Mexico in 1961. She then attended Columbia University for graduate school, studying urban planning. In 1969 she joined the National Organization for Women (NOW) and became one of the first people to speak out for lesbian rights on panels at the New York chapter of NOW and at Columbia University. Abbott was a member of the Lavender Menace and co-authored Sappho Was a Right-on Woman: A Liberated View of Lesbianism in 1971, with Barbara Love. In the mid-1970s, with Barbara Love, she lobbied for a NOW task force to be established to focus on lesbian issues, eventually it was established. NOW first named the task force the \"sexuality and lesbian task force,\" and Abbott had to co-chair with a heterosexual woman. At the NOW national conference in Philadelphia in 1976, Abbott demanded that 1% of the organizations budget should go to the task force, and succeeded. During the conference, it was only one of two resolutions to pass. Abbott served on the founding board of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and worked to ensure the organization's board was equal numbers gay men and lesbian women. She was named by the Manhattan Borough President to the community planning board; she was the first openly gay person to do so.

"}, {"text": "Zulkifli Abdhir (5 January 1966 or 5 October 1966 \u2013 25 January 2015) was a Malaysian who was one of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agency offered a US$5 million reward for information leading to his capture. He was the maker of bombs delivered for usage to several terrorist groups. He was often referred to by the nom de guerre Marwan. He was suspected of leading the Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia, being part of the central command of the Jemaah Islamiyah, and of involvement in the 2002 Bali bombings. He was suspected of hiding in Mindanao under the protection of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. Zulkifli was killed on 25 January 2015 by Special Action Force (SAF) officers during the raid that culminated in the Mamasapano clash. Zulkifli was born on 5 January 1966 or 5 October 1966 in Muar, Johor, Malaysia. Zulkifli was known to reference both dates in different circumstances as his date of birth. According to the FBI, he was 5 feet 6 inches tall, approximately 120 pounds, and could speak Malay, Tagalog, English, and Arabic. Zulkifli attended a boarding school in Malaysia until he trained overseas as an engineer in the USA. After his training, he abruptly left his 10 siblings and 3 children to join up with terrorist activities. I remember him saying that he wanted to secure a good job and provide for the family. He used to take me sightseeing regularly and helped me with the household expenses. Then he was gone. Zulkifli, often going under the nom de guerre \"Marwan\", was suspected to be in charge of the South Eastern Asian and Indonesian terrorist group called the Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM). The KMM is/was a part of the international terrorist organisation, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), of which Zulkifli was believed to be part of its central command. The JI is the main cause of the devastating 2002 Bali bombings and many other attacks in South Eastern Asia of which Zulkifli's involvement in is also suspected. Abdhir also co-founded the terrorist group Khalifa Islamiyah Mindanao. He was initially wanted by the Malaysian government for the killing of a Christian member of their Parliament in 2000, which was an attack that was backed by Al-Qaeda. Zulkifli was wanted for the allegation of being a supplier of bombs to various terrorist groups around the world. He was also under suspicion of teaching terrorists how to create bombs. Zulkifli, himself, was taught to make IEDs by the terrorist Azahari Husin. He was involved in the building of bombs for the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group, which brought him into brief collaborations with Umar Patek, before Patek's leaving to Pakistan, and with Khadaffy Janjalani (deceased). Zulkifli was indicted for arrest on 1 August 2007 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. While hiding in Mindanao under the protection of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), he continued to stay involved in militant Islamic activity and terrorist bombings. An anonymous military source told Gulf News that, along with other South Eastern Asian militants, Zulkifli was engaged in the training of local jihadist volunteers to join The Islamic State. This was reported after the BIFF declared its allegiance to helping ISIL's cause. Sources have estimated that during his militant activity in Mindanao he may have trained up to 300 terrorists in explosives use, detonation, and building. It was reported from news organisations on 26 January 2015, that the Jemaah Islamiyah in co-ordination with Zulkifli had planned to construct a bomb to be detonated as the papal convoy drove down T. M. Kalaw Street in Manila on 18 January. The source also claimed that another attempt on the Pope's life was planned the day before, but was thwarted by changes in the Pope's plans. Filipino police have denied the legitimacy of these reports. His brother, Rahmat Abdhir, was arrested in California for conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, providing material to terrorists, false statements, and providing material to a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (Zulkifli). In an email between the two they discussed the exchange rates and prices of weapons, specifically an M60 machine gun. Further investigation showed that Rahmat had wired over 10,000 dollars to his brother. Federal agents discovered 1,000 rounds of ammunition, scopes to sniper rifles, two-way radios, military training manuals, and materials used to make bombs. Rahmat was refused bail twice, once upon his initial arrest and a second time in 2008. He is currently in custody in a California prison, contrary to unverified reports of his residence being in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, where he submitted his DNA to confirm his brother's demise. The FBI told Reuters that he was \"a person familiar with the testing procedures\", indicating they extracted his DNA previously. His brother-in-law, Taufik bin Abdul Halim was also arrested for terrorist charges in 2001 for involvement in an attempted mall bombing located in Jakarta, Indonesia. The explosive device reportedly triggered early leading to little or no injuries besides Taufik himself, who lost his leg in the explosion. After 12 years in jail for his attempted bombing, Taufik was released and flown back to Johor to be with his family after being pardoned by President of Indonesia Joko Widodo. Malaysian police have promised to monitor his actions due to his high-profile relation to Zulkifli. Zulkifli Abdhir is the cousin of Malaysian terrorist Mohamad Farik Amin (alias Zubair Zaid), who is also suspected as a main culprit in the 2002 Bali bombings. Amin is one of two Malaysians to be currently detained at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. Early reports claimed that in the Philippines, Zulkifli died during an airstrike on 2 February 2012. The Malaysian government asked for an official DNA comparison to the DNA of one of Zulkifli's siblings. DNA results were obtained from family members of Zulkifli. His body was never found despite reports of his death. The statements of his supposed death were later retracted as the manhunt continued. Von Al Haq, a spokesperson for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), claimed in 2013 that Zulkifli was being protected by Ameril Umbra Kato's Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF). This claim was later corroborated by an interrogation with a detained Abu Sayyaf commander, Khair Mundos, who claimed that he travelled to the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters with Zulkifli. Local informants have also claimed Zulkifli to have visited the province of Maguindanao. The detained Abu Sayyaf leader claimed that Zulkifli, and other high ranking Jemaah Islamiyah leader, Muhamda \"Muawiyah\" Ali, escaped the February airstrike that was reported to have killed them in Sulu and have taken refuge with the Bangsamoro separatists. The Philippine National Police Special Action Force attempted an operation on 25 January 2015 to arrest Zulkifli. The operation culminated in a battle in Mamasapano between the PNP and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), breaking the ceasefire. The MILF was later joined by their breakaway group, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, in a battle that led to the death of 44 police officers, several civilians, and at least 18 militants. The Philippines mobilised more reinforcements though they were cautious in attempting to not create more civilian casualties. Reasons for the clashes and renewed hostilities are being attributed to a lack of communication between the PNP, the military, and MILF before undertaking the operation. It was thought of as \"highly likely\" that Zulkifli had been killed in the raid until the FBI provided DNA confirmation of his demise in the clash. Reports say that he was killed by SAF officer(s) on 25 January 2015. Early in the morning of 25 January 2015, Zulkifli was reportedly taken by surprise as his nipa hut was raided by SAF member(s) who proceeded to shoot and kill Zulkifli after a brief exchange of fire. The commandos sent a cellphone message back to their base saying: \"Mike 1 bingo\", a code to be used in case Zulkifli was neutralised. An SAF officer severed one of Zulkifli's fingers and retrieved a hair sample to bring back for official DNA testing, as Zulkifli's body could not be recovered in time due to heavy fire. His corpse was quickly buried by civilians in accordance with Islamic tradition. Regional governor Mujiv Sabbihi Hataman has stated that the body could not be exhumed as that would go against Islamic burial practices. The FBI were requested to help confirm Marwan's DNA samples. The status of his death remained controversial for a while after it was reported, due to the Sulu airstrike incident in 2012, where the military incorrectly reported Zulkifli's death until August 2014. Despite claims of his demise, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) claimed that Marwan was still alive. The MNLF confirmed Zulkifli's demise in the clash and continues to state that they have not been sheltering Zulkifli. The MNLF said that based on an intelligence report they received that said Marwan is dead as a result of the encounter. MILF chairman Al-Hajj Murad Ebrahim also told that Abdul Basit Usman, who was also pursued by SAF troops was able to escape. It was reported that his last words as he attempted to fire against the SAF officers raiding his nipa hut were \"Allahu Akbar!\" On 4 February 2015, the FBI sent a message to Philippine authorities confirming that the DNA obtained from the killed man during the PNP Special Action Force Operation Exodus was from Zulkifli. Though absolute identification was not possible in the preliminary stages of testing, the FBI has reported that the DNA samples were very likely to be Zulkifli's due to striking similarities. The FBI officially confirmed Zulkifli's death on April 1, 2015. His family in Malaysia have said that they have no intention to claim his body, his daughter said \"To us, our father died a long time ago, there is no need to claim the body. \"A male relative said; \"Our family had been informed six times, over the years, that he had been killed. I am tired of saying Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un (surely we belong to Allah and to Him shall we return). All he told us were lies after lies. We are the ones who were forced to face the predicament of his doings. More so after he was labelled as the mastermind behind the 2002 Bali Bombings. \" adding that the only person who still saw the good in Marwan was his mother. The same male relative spoke angrily of Zulkifli's brother Rahmat and claimed that he was highly impressionable and was manipulated by Zulkifli into providing the support that he did. The relative blamed Zulkifli for ruining Rahmat's life, including for his children and wife.

He was widely recognized as an outstanding actor and the many productions that he directed provided him with a reputation as one of the leading theater directors in Iran. In 1979, he was admitted to the dramatic arts faculty of Tehran to start his education in the directing and acting program. Abdollahi established the Koocheh (meaning alley in English) theater group in his birthplace in 1970. During 46 years of activity, he staged numerous plays both as an actor and as a director. He also acted in many movies, TV theaters, Radio dramas, and TV series. His artistic activities include acting and directing in 62 theater productions, directing several TV theaters and short films, directing and voice acting in more than 500 radio plays, and playing in famous TV series like Heroes Never Die, Lighter Than Darkness, and Zero Degree Turn. Abdollahi is also the recipient of many awards for various artistic activities. Born in 1955 in the city of Borujerd, Abdollahi passed his childhood and teenage years in his birthplace. As he said: \"I was registered in Bahman school of Borujerd\". He established Koocheh theater group in 1970. Koocheh theater, which was the first scientific and organized theater in Borujerd, announced its existence by performing the Farmer of Chicago by Mark Twain. Activity of Koocheh theater group in borujerd lasted until 1979. During 9 years, the members of Koocheh theater group performed 17 plays from famous Iranian and western playwrights such as Bahram Beyzai, Athol Fugard, William Shakespeare, Gholam-Hossein Sa'edi, and Augusta, Lady Gregory. After starting his studies at the Dramatic Arts Faculty of Tehran, Abdollahi was selected to play a small role in a play titled Enemies written by Maxim Gorky and directed by maestro Rokneddin Khosravi. Within the rehearsal sessions, his virtuosity and endeavor caused Khosravi to choose him for Zakarov role, which is one of the leading roles in Enemies. This play, however, was not performed because of the so-called cultural revolution and its sequences in Iran. Iranian cultural revolution caused universities to be closed, therefore Abdollahi voluntarily went to Kerman province to help earthquake-stricken people and collaborated in rebuilding damaged towns. Because of universities reopening in Iran by the end of the cultural revolution, he came back to Tehran and prepared Sizwe Banzi is dead as the graduation thesis of his classmate Majid Beheshti. His brilliant performance attracted Hamid Samandarian's and Ghotbeddin Sadeghi's attentions who were two outstanding directors in Iran. Abdollahi was one the first artists invited to join Honar theater group which was established by Ghotbeddin Sadeghi. He collaborated with Honar theater group as the director and actor in more than 25 plays. During 90's, the acting duo Mostafa Abdollahi and Michael Shahrestani was very famous and admirable in the Iran theater. Many people know Abdollahi for his playing the role of an Iranian hero named Arsalan in the Heroes Never Die TV series. Abdollahi started his acting in Iran television since 1986. He also participated in several movies such as Living with the presence of a wall, Eye witness, and Mah-banoo. Moreover, Abdollahi had many successful experiences in acting and directing dramas for Iran national radio and television. By and large, he was recognized as a prominent artist in Iran and as Ghotbeddin Sadeghi said: \u201cHe never staged dull and useless plays, which are far from the culture of his homeland and he had faith in what he did on stage\u201dHaving a critical approach towards the domestic affairs in Iran, Mostafa Abdollahi profoundly tried to introduce salient western playwrights to the Iranian society. For Instance, he was the first Iranian producer who directed a play by Pavel Kohout titled War on the third floor. Abdollahi also introduced famous Russian writer Nikolai Erdman to Iranian audience by staging The mandate. After performing Accidental death of an anarchist, a play written by Dari Fo, Koocheh theater group founded by Abdollahi was recognized the best theater group in Iran in 2013. While having his last play, The lower depths written by Maxim Gorky, on the stage of the main hall of the Tehran City Theater Complex, he passed away in Tehran on 21 May 2015 after 14 years of suffering from blood cancer. During 46 years of artistic activity, Abdollahi received numerous awards from various festivals and was paid tributes by his colleague and also Iranian universities.

His brother, Prince Jiluwi bin Abdul Aziz bin Musa'ed, is the governor of Najran Region. Prince Abdullah was appointed by King Saud as a northern border region governor in 1956. Prince Abdullah bin Abdullaziz bin Musa'ed died on 4 July 2015. He was buried after Isha prayer on 6 July 2015 at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.

He ascended to the throne on 1 August 2005 upon the death of his half-brother, King Fahd. Abdullah, like Fahd, was one of the many sons of Ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Abdullah held important political posts throughout most of his adult life. In 1961 he became mayor of Mecca, his first public office. The following year, he was appointed commander of the Saudi Arabian National Guard, a post he was still holding when he became king. He also served as deputy defense minister and was named crown prince when Fahd took the throne in 1982. After King Fahd suffered a serious stroke in 1995, Abdullah became the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia until ascending the throne a decade later. During his reign he maintained close relations with United States and United Kingdom and bought billions of dollars worth of defense equipment from both states. He also gave women the right to vote for municipal councils and to compete in the Olympics. Furthermore, Abdullah maintained the status quo when there were waves of protest in the kingdom during the Arab Spring. In November 2013, a BBC report claimed that, due to the close relations it had with Pakistan, Saudi Arabia could obtain nuclear weapons at will from that country. The King also had a longstanding relationship with Pakistan, and brokered a compromise between ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and General Pervez Musharraf, whom he had requested to be exiled to Saudi Arabia for a 10-year exile, following his ouster in the 1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat. The King outlived two of his crown princes. Conservative Interior Minister Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud was named heir to the throne on the death of Sultan bin Abdulaziz in October 2011, but Nayef himself died in June 2012. Abdullah then named 76-year-old defense minister, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, as crown prince. According to various reports, Abdullah married up to 30 times and had more than 35 children. The king had a personal fortune estimated at US$18 billion, making him the third wealthiest head of state in the world. He died on 23 January 2015, at the age of 90, three weeks after being hospitalized for pneumonia, and was succeeded as king by his half-brother Salman of Saudi Arabia. Abdullah is said to have been born on 1 August 1924 in Riyadh. However, some sources state that this date is incorrect, and that he was approximately eight years older. He was the tenth son of King Abdulaziz. His mother, Fahda bint Asi Al Shuraim, was a member of the Al Rashid dynasty, longtime rivals of the Al Saud dynasty. She was descended from the powerful Shammar tribe \u2013 and was the daughter of former tribe chief, Asi Shuraim. She died when Abdullah was six years old. He had younger full-sisters. Madawi Al-Rasheed argues that his maternal roots and his earlier experience of a speech impediment led to delay in his rise to higher status among the other sons of King Abdulaziz. In 1963, Abdullah was made commander of Saudi National Guard (SANG). This post allowed him to secure his position in the House of Saud. SANG, which had been based on the Ikhwan, became a modern armed force under his command. Beginning 1985, SANG also sponsored the Janadiriyah festival that institutionalized traditional folk dances, camel races and tribal heritage. King Khalid appointed Prince Abdullah as second deputy prime minister in March 1975, a reflection of his status as second in the line of succession to the Saudi throne. In other words, upon this appointment, Prince Abdullah became the number three man in the Saudi administration. However, his appointment caused friction in the House of Saud. Then-crown prince Prince Fahd, together with his full-brothers known as the Sudairi Seven, supported the appointment of their own full brother, Prince Sultan. Prince Abdullah was pressured to cede control of SANG in return for his appointment as Second Deputy Prime Minister. In August 1977, this generated a debate among hundreds of princes in Riyadh. Abdullah did not relinquish authority of SANG because he feared that this would weaken his authority. On 13 June 1982 \u2013 the day King Khalid died \u2013 Fahd bin Abdulaziz became King, Prince Abdullah became Crown Prince the same day and also maintained his position as head of the National Guard. During his years as crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz was described as a supporter of accommodation. He managed to group a large number of fringe and marginalized princes discontented with the prospect of the succession being passed among the Sudairi brothers one after the other. His control of the National Guard was also a key factor to his success in becoming crown prince. When King Fahd was incapacitated by a major stroke in 1995, Crown Prince Abdullah acted as de facto regent of Saudi Arabia. In May 2001, Crown Prince Abdullah did not accept an invitation to visit Washington due to US support for Israel in the Second Intifada. He also appeared more eager than King Fahd to cut government spending and open Saudi Arabia up economically. He pushed for Saudi membership of the World Trade Organization, surprising some. In August 2001, he ordered then Saudi Ambassador to the US, Bandar bin Sultan, to return to Washington. This reportedly occurred after Crown Prince Abdullah witnessed brutality inflicted by an Israeli soldier upon a Palestinian woman. Later, he also condemned Israel for attacking families of suspects. In 2002, he developed the Arab Peace Initiative, commonly referred to as the \"Abdullah plan\", to achieve a mutually agreed-on resolution of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. The initiative was adopted at the Arab League's Beirut summit in March 2002. On the second anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Crown Prince Abdullah wrote a letter to US President George W. Bush, which ended with the following words: \"God Almighty, in His wisdom, tests the faithful by allowing such calamities to happen. But He, in His mercy, also provides us with the will and determination, generated by faith, to enable us to transform such tragedies into great achievements, and crises that seem debilitating are transformed into opportunities for the advancement of humanity. I only hope that, with your cooperation and leadership, a new world will emerge out of the rubble of the World Trade Center: a world that is blessed by the virtues of freedom, peace, prosperity and harmony. \" By late 2003, after the Saudi Arabian branch of al-Qaeda carried out a series of bombings that threatened to destabilize the country, Crown Prince Abdullah, together with other decision-making elites began to deal with political concerns. As Toby Jones wrote in Middle East Report: One of such moves was his project to promote more tolerance for religious diversity and rein in the forces of politico-religious extremism in the kingdom, leading to the establishment of National Dialogue. In the summer of 2003, Abdullah threw his considerable weight behind the creation of a national dialogue that brought leading religious figures together, including a highly publicized meeting attended by the kingdom's preeminent Shi'i scholar Hasan al-Saffar, as well as a group of Sunni clerics that had previously expressed their loathing for the Shi'i minority. Abdullah succeeded to the throne upon the death of his half-brother King Fahd. He was formally enthroned on 2 August 2005. King Abdullah's administration attempted reforms in different fields. In 2005, King Abdullah implemented a government scholarship program to send young Saudi men and women abroad for undergraduate and postgraduate studies in different universities around the world. The program offered funds for tuition and living expenses up to four years. It is estimated that more than 70,000 young Saudis studied abroad in more than 25 countries, with the United States, England, and Australia as top three destinations aimed for by the students. There are more than 22,000 Saudi students studying in the United States, exceeding pre-9/11 levels. Public health engagement included breast cancer awareness and CDC cooperation to set up an advanced epidemic screening network to protect 2010's three million Hajj pilgrims. King Abdullah implemented many reform measures. He re-shuffled the Ministry of Education's leadership in February 2009 by bringing in his pro-reform son-in-law, Faisal bin Abdullah, as the new minister. He also appointed Nora Al Fayez, a U. S. -educated former teacher, as deputy education minister in charge of a new department for female students. He brought about a top-to-bottom restructuring of the country's courts to introduce, among other things, review of judicial decisions and more professional training for Shari'a judges. He developed a new investment promotion agency to overhaul the once-convoluted process of starting a business in Saudi Arabia and created a regulatory body for capital markets. He also promoted the construction of the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (the country's new flagship and controversially co-ed institution for advanced scientific research). King Abdullah invested in educating the workforce for future jobs. The Saudi government also encouraged the development of non-hydrocarbon sectors in which the Kingdom had a comparative advantage, including mining, solar energy, and religious tourism. The Kingdom's 2010 budget reflected these priorities\u2014about 25 percent was devoted to education alone\u2014and amounts to a significant economic stimulus package. The response of his administration to homegrown terrorism was a series of crackdowns including raids by security forces, arrests, torture and public beheadings. He vowed to fight terrorist ideologies within the country. He also made the protection of Saudi Arabia's critical infrastructure a top security priority. His strategy against terrorism was two-pronged: he attacked the roots of the extremism that fed Al-Qaida through education and judicial reforms to weaken the influence of the most reactionary elements of Saudi Arabia's religious establishment. In August 2010, King Abdullah decreed that only officially approved religious scholars associated with the Senior Council of Ulema would be allowed to issue fatwas. Similar decrees since 2005 were previously seldom enforced. Individual fatwas relating to personal matters were exempt from the royal decree. The decree also instructed the Grand Mufti to identify eligible scholars. In light of the Arab Spring, Abdullah laid down a $37-billion (\u20ac32,8 billion) programme of new spending including new jobless benefits, education and housing subsidies, debt write-offs, and a new sports channel. There was also a pledge to spend a total of $400 billion by the end of 2014 to improve education, health care and the kingdom's infrastructure. However, Saudi police arrested 100 Shiite protesters who complained of government discrimination. Later during the 2011\u20132012 Saudi Arabian protests, in September 2011, the King announced women's right to vote in the 2015 municipal council elections, a first significant reform step in the country since the protests. He also stated that women would become eligible to take part in the unelected shura. In January 2012, King Abdullah dismissed the head of Saudi Arabia's powerful religious police, replacing him with a more moderate cleric, state news agency SPA reported, without giving reasons. Abdullatif Abdel Aziz al-Sheikh was named, in place of Sheikh Abdulaziz al-Humain, to head the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. King Abdullah had appointed Humain in 2009 to head the \"mutaween,\" which ensures the strict application of the country's ultra-conservative version of Islam, as a step towards reforming it. Humain hired consultants to restructure the organisation, met local human rights groups and consulted professional image-builders in a broad public relations campaign. Under his leadership the commission also investigated and punished some \"out-of-control\" officers for misbehaviour. In July 2012, Saudi Arabia announced that it would allow its women athletes to compete in the Olympics for the first time and that the country's Olympic Committee would \"oversee participation of women athletes who can qualify\". The decision ended speculation that the entire Saudi team might have been disqualified on grounds of gender discrimination. The public participation of women in sport was still fiercely opposed by many Saudi religious conservatives. There had been almost no public tradition of women participating in sport in the country. Saudi officials said that, if successful in qualifying, female competitors would be dressed \"to preserve their dignity\". On 11 January 2013, King Abdullah appointed thirty women to the Consultative Assembly or Shura Council and modified the related law to mandate that no less than 20 percent of 150 members would be women. In August 2013, the Saudi cabinet, for the first time, approved a law making domestic violence a criminal offence. The law calls for a punishment of up to a year in prison and a fine of up to 50,000 riyals (\u20ac11. 500/US$13,000). The maximum punishments could be doubled for repeat offenders. The law criminalizes psychological, sexual as well as physical abuse. It also includes a provision obliging employees to report instances of abuse in the workplace to their employer. The move followed a Twitter campaign. The new laws were welcomed by Saudi women's rights activists, although some expressed concerns that the law could not be implemented successfully without new training for the judiciary, and that the tradition of male guardianship would remain an obstacle to prosecutions. In November 2007, King Abdullah visited Pope Benedict XVI in the Apostolic Palace, being first Saudi monarch to do so. In March 2008, he called for a \"brotherly and sincere dialogue between believers from all religions\". In June 2008, he held a conference in Mecca to urge Muslim leaders to speak with one voice with Jewish and Christian leaders. He discussed with, and obtained approval from, Saudi and non-Saudi Islamic scholars to hold the interfaith dialogue. In the same month, Saudi Arabia and Spain agreed to hold the interfaith dialogue in Spain. The historic conference finally took place in Madrid in July 2008, wherein religious leaders of different faiths participated, and which later led to the 2010 proclamation of World Interfaith Harmony Week. He had never previously made overtures for dialogue with eastern religious leaders, such as Hindus and Buddhists. The Mecca conference discussed a paper on dialogue with monotheists \u2014 highlighting the monotheistic religions of southeast Asia, including Sikhism \u2014 in the third axis of the fourth meeting, titled \"With Whom We Talk,\" presented by Sheikh Badrul Hasan Al Qasimi. The session was chaired by Ezz Eddin Ibrahim, cultural adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates. The session also discussed a paper presented on coordination among Islamic institutions on Dialogue by Abdullah bin Omar Nassif, Secretary General of the World Islamic Council for Preaching and Relief and a paper on dialogue with divine messages, presented by Professor Mohammad Sammak \u2013 Secretary General of the Islamic Spiritual Summit in Lebanon. In November 2008, he and his government arranged discussion at the United Nations General Assembly to \"promote dialogue among civilizations, cultures and peoples, as well as activities related to a culture of peace\" and calling for \"concrete action at the global, regional and subregional levels. \" It brought together Muslim and non-Muslim nations to eradicate preconceptions as to Islam and terrorism, with world leaders \u2013 including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, Israeli President Shimon Peres, US President George W. Bush and King Abdullah II of Jordan \u2013 attending. In 2011, an agreement for the establishment of the King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue in Vienna was signed between the governments of Austria, Spain, and Saudi Arabia. The official opening of the centre was in November 2012, with foreign Minister Saud Al Faisal as its first general secretary and Austria's former federal justice minister Claudia Bandion-Ortner as the first deputy general secretary. King Abdullah called for the establishment of an Arab common market in January 2011. Saudi foreign minister, Saud bin Faisal, stated that the Arab Customs Union would be ready by 2015, and that by 2017 the common market would also be in place. There have been intensive efforts to link Arab countries with a railway system and an electricity power grid. Work on the power grid project has started in some Arab countries. King Abdullah had long been pro-American and a longtime close ally of the United States. In October 1976, as Prince Abdullah was being trained for greater responsibility in Riyadh, he was sent to the United States to meet with President Gerald Ford. He again traveled to the United States as Crown Prince in October 1987, meeting Vice President George H. W. Bush. In September 1998, Crown Prince Abdullah made a state visit to the United States to meet in Washington with President Bill Clinton. In September 2000, he attended millennium celebrations at the United Nations in New York City. In April 2002, Crown Prince Abdullah made a state visit to the United States with President George W. Bush and he returned again in April 2005 with Bush. In April 2009, at a summit for world leaders President Barack Obama met with King Abdullah, while in June 2009 he hosted President Obama in Saudi Arabia. In turn, Obama hosted the King at the White House in the same month. King Abdullah showed great support for Obama's presidency. \"Thank God for bringing Obama to the presidency\", he said, adding that Obama's election created \"great hope\" in the Muslim world. He stated, \"We (the US and Saudi Arabia) spilled blood together\" in Kuwait and Iraq, that Saudi Arabia valued this tremendously and that friendship could be a difficult issue that requires work, but that the United States and Saudi Arabia had done it for 70 years over three generations. \"Our disagreements don't cut to the bone\", he stated. He was the leading gift-giver to the US president and his office in his first two years in office, his gifts totaling more than $300,000. A ruby and diamond jewelry set, given by the king and accepted by Michelle Obama on behalf of the United States, was worth $132,000. However, according to US federal law, gifts of such nature and value are accepted \"on behalf of the United States\" and are considered property of the US government. The Bush administration ignored advice from him and Saudi foreign minister Saud Al Faisal against invading Iraq. However, other sources said that many Arab governments were only nominally opposed to the Iraq invasion because of popular hostility. Before becoming king, Prince Abdullah was thought to be completely against the US invasion of Iraq; this, however, was not the case. Riyadh provided essential support to the United States during the war and proved that \"necessity does lead to some accommodations from time to time\". The King expressed a complete lack of trust in Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki and held out little hope for improved Saudi-Iraqi relations as long as al-Maliki remained in office. King Abdullah told an Iraqi official about Al Maliki, \"You and Iraq are in my heart, but that man is not. \"In September 2014, following the spread of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), he issued a statement, \"From the cradle of revelation and the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, I call on leaders and scholars of the Islamic nation to carry out their duty towards God Almighty, and to stand in the face of those trying to hijack Islam and present it to the world as a religion of extremism, hatred, and terrorism, and to speak the word of truth, and not fear anybody. Our nation today is passing through a critical, historic stage, and history will be witness against those who have been the tool exploited by the enemies to disperse and tear the nation and tarnish the pure image of Islam\". In 2006, Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei had sent his adviser Ali Akbar Velayati with a letter asking for King Abdullah's agreement to establish a formal back channel of communication between the two leaders. Abdullah said he had agreed, and the channel was established, with Velayati and Saud Al Faisal as the points of contact. In the ensuing years, the King noted, the channel had never been used. In April 2008, according to a US cable released by WikiLeaks, King Abdullah had told the US Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, and General David Petraeus to \"cut off the head of the snake\". Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to Washington, Adel al-Jubeir, \"recalled the King's frequent exhortations to the US to attack Iran\" and to put an end to that country's nuclear program. King Abdullah asserted that Iran was trying to set up Hezbollah-like organizations in African countries, observing that the Iranians didn't think they were doing anything wrong and didn't recognize their mistakes. He said that the Iranians \"launch missiles with the hope of putting fear in people and the world\". The King described his conversation with Iranian foreign minister Mottaki as \"a heated exchange, frankly discussing Iran's interference in Arab affairs\". When challenged by the King on Iranian meddling in Hamas affairs, Mottaki apparently protested that \"these are Muslims\". \"No, Arabs\", countered the King. \"You as Persians have no business meddling in Arab matters\". King Abdullah said he would favor Rafsanjani in an Iranian election. He told General Jones that Iranian internal turmoil presented an opportunity to weaken the regime\u2014which he encouraged\u2014but he also urged that this be done covertly, stressing that public statements in support of the reformers were counterproductive. The King assessed that sanctions could help weaken the government, but only if they are strong and sustained. Saudi Arabia, by the endorsement of the Gulf Cooperation Council, sent 1,200 troops to Bahrain to protect industrial facilities, resulting in strained relations with the United States. The military personnel were part of the Peninsula Shield Force, which is stationed in Saudi Arabia, but not affiliated to one country alone. In December 2010, leaked diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks revealed that King Abdullah wanted all released detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to be tracked using an implanted microchip, in a way similar to race horses. The King made the private suggestion during a meeting in Riyadh in March 2009 with White House counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan. Brennan replied that \"horses don't have good lawyers\" and that such a proposal would \"face legal hurdles\" in the United States. Since King Abdullah's visit to Beijing in January 2006, Saudi-Chinese relations have focused predominantly on energy and trade. The king's visit was the first by a Saudi head of state to China since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1990. Bilateral trade with China has more than tripled, and China would soon be Saudi Arabia's largest importer. Saudi Arabia also committed significant investments in China, including the $8 billion Fujian refinery. Based on a WikiLeaks cable, the King told the Chinese that it was willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not to develop nuclear weapons. In late March 2011, King Abdullah sent Bandar, Secretary General of the National Security Council, to China to gain its support regarding Saudi Arabia's attitude towards the Arab Spring. In turn, lucrative arms contracts were secretly offered to China by the Kingdom. Furthermore, King Abdullah believed that China as well as India were the future markets for Saudi energy. In November 2009, King Abdullah was received by Nicolas Sarkozy, who committed various diplomatic faux pas. The diplomatic relationship Jacques Chirac had with Saudi Arabia was not evident with Sarkozy. In January 2011, the Kingdom granted asylum to the ousted Tunisian leader, Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, under conditions of no further political involvement. According to leaked cables, King Abdullah was more receptive than Crown Prince Sultan to former Yemeni President Saleh. King Abdullah supported renewed diplomatic relations with the Syrian government and Bashar al-Assad. They met in Damascus on 7 October 2009. In addition, Assad attended the opening of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in October 2009. Relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia deteriorated as a result of the Syrian Civil War. In August 2011, King Abdullah recalled the Saudi Ambassador from Damascus due to the political unrest in Syria and closed its embassy. In December 2011, King Abdullah called on leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council to strengthen their alliance into a united \"single entity\" as they confront threats to national security. \"I ask you today to move from a stage of cooperation to a stage of union in a single entity\", King Abdullah said at the opening session of a GCC meeting in Riyadh in comments aired on Saudi state television. \u201cNo doubt, you all know we are targeted in our security and stability. \u201d On 16 February 2003, Parade magazine's David Wallechinsky rated King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah as the second worst dictators in the world. Most of this criticism stems from the fact that most of Saudi citizens live under a strict Wahhabist interpretation of Sharia law, which mandates the amputation of hands as a punishment for theft and floggings for crimes like drunkenness. Execution by public beheading is common for murder, rape, drug trafficking and witchcraft, and Abdullah's policies towards the rights of women have also been criticized. In a slight rebuff to accusations of human rights violations, Saudi inmates of Najran Province sent the King well-wishes from jail and wished him a speedy recovery. King Abdullah has also been criticized for his policies on religious freedom and the Saudi government allegedly has arrested Shiite pilgrims on the Hajj. On 24 January 2007, Human Rights Watch sent an open letter to King Abdullah asking him to cease religious persecution of the Ahmadi faith in Saudi Arabia. Two letters were sent in November 2006 and February 2007 asking him to remove the travel ban on critics of the Saudi government. Human Rights Watch has not yet indicated whether they have received any response to these letters. On 30 October 2007, during a state visit to the UK, King Abdullah was accused by protestors of being a \"murderer\" and a \"torturer\". Concerns were raised about the treatment of women and homosexuals by the Saudi kingdom and over alleged bribes involving arms deals between Saudi Arabia and the UK. King Abdullah's heir apparent was his half-brother Crown Prince Sultan until the latter's death on 22 October 2011. The title of Crown Prince then passed to Prince Sultan's full-brother, Nayef, until his death in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June 2012, while undergoing medical tests for an undisclosed ailment. His third heir apparent was his half-brother Salman, who was named as Crown Prince on 18 June 2012, and would succeed him in 2015. In 2006, Abdullah set up the Allegiance Council, a body that is composed of the sons and grandsons of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdulaziz, to vote by a secret ballot to choose future kings and crown princes. The council's mandate was not to have started until after the reigns of both King Abdullah and late Prince Sultan were over. It was not clear what was to happen when Prince Sultan died before the end of Abdullah's reign, leaving a question as to whether the council would vote for a new crown prince, or whether Prince Nayef would automatically fill that position. Despite such concerns, Prince Nayef was appointed Crown Prince on 27 October 2011 after consultation with the Allegiance Council by Abdullah. In November 2010, Prince Nayef chaired a cabinet meeting because of the deterioration of the King's health. During the same month, King Abdullah transferred his duties as Commander of the Saudi National Guard to his son Prince Mutaib. King Abdullah is credited with building up the once largely ceremonial unit into a modern 260,000-strong force that is a counterweight to the army. The Guard, which was Abdullah's original power base, protects the royal family. This was suggested as an apparent sign that the elderly monarch was beginning to lessen some of his duties. King Abdullah was Commander of the Saudi National Guard from 1963 to 2010. He was Chairman of the Saudi Supreme Economic Council until 2009. He also continued to be the President of the High Council for Petroleum and Minerals, President of the King Abdulaziz Center For National Dialogue, Chairman of the Council of Civil Service, and head of the Military Service Council until his death in 2015. King Abdullah followed his father's (King Abdulaziz's) path in terms of marriage in that he married the daughters of the al Shalan of Anizah, al Fayz of Bani Sakhr, and al Jarbah of the Iraqi branch of the Shammar tribe. King Abdullah had about 30 wives, and fathered about 35 children. One of his wives is the sister of Rifaat al-Assad's wife. He also married Jawahir bint Ali Hussein from Al Jiluwi clan, with whom he had a daughter, Princess Anoud and a son, Prince Saud. Aida Fustuq was another wife of Abdullah, they had two children, Adila and Abdulaziz. They divorced later. Munira bint Abdullah Al Al Shaykh was the wife of King Abdullah and gave birth to his eldest living son, Prince Khaled. Tathi bint Mishan al Faisal Al Jarba gave birth to Prince Mishaal. King Abdullah's eldest son, Prince Khalid, was deputy commander of the Saudi Arabian National Guard West until 1992. His second son, Prince Mutaib, is former commander and current minister of the National Guard. His mother is Munira Al Otaishan. Prince Mishaal was governor of the Makkah Province (2013\u20132015). Prince Abdulaziz was the king's former Syria adviser and has been deputy foreign affairs minister since 2011. Prince Faisal is head of the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent Society. King Abdullah's seventh son, Prince Turki, who was a pilot in the Royal Saudi Air Force, was governor of the Riyadh Province (2014\u20132015). The youngest son, Prince Badr, was born in 2003, when Abdullah was about 79 years old. In October 2015, his son, Prince Majed bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, was arrested in Los Angeles for using cocaine, being drunk, threatening female employees, and forcing them to watch him having gay sex with a male employee. King Abdullah's daughter Princess Adila is married to Faisal bin Abdullah bin Mohammed. She is one of the few Saudi princesses with a semi-public role, and a known advocate of women's right to drive. She is also known as \"her father's public face\". One of Abdullah's younger daughters, Princess Sahab, was born in 1993. Sahab bint Abdullah married Khalid bin Hamad Al Khalifa, son of Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, on 6 June 2011. Princess Sahab is the daughter of the king from his wife of the Al-Jarbah tribe. From his marriage to Princess Alanoud Al Fayez (arranged when she was 15 without her having ever met him), whom he has now divorced, he had four daughters \u2013 Princesses Sahar, Maha, Hala and Jawahir. The four princesses have been under house arrest for the last 16 years, and are not allowed to leave the country. After media releases in March 2014, Sahar and Jawaher received no food or clean water for 25 days, lost 10 kilos each and their mother carried out weekly protests in front of the Saudi Arabian embassy in London, and about which Sahar and Jawaher released a video while under house arrest pleading for help from the international community. King Abdullah also had a daughter called Princess Nora who died in 1990 in a car accident. Princess Fayza is yet another daughter. She is the mother of Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasser Al Saud who was accused of murdering his servant Bandar Abdulaziz in London in 2010. King Abdullah was the half brother of both his predecessors, including King Fahd, and his successor, King Salman. The King had curtailed his activities from June 2010 with no clear explanation. Diplomats said there had been uncertainty about the extent of his health problems since Abdullah canceled a visit to France. In a television appearance in which he was seen to use a cane, King Abdullah said he was in good health but had something \"bothering\" him. In a visit by US diplomats to Saudi Arabia in April 2014 the Saudi King was seen connected to breathing tubes during talks, indicating increasing health problems. From 2010 to 2012 King Abdullah had four back surgeries. The first two of the surgeries were in New York, one in 2010 for a slipped disk and a blood clot pressing on nerves in his back and a second to stabilize vertebrae in 2011. The third one was in Riyadh in 2011. And the last one was also in Riyadh on 17 November 2012. In November 2010, his back problems came to light in the media. He had an \"accumulation of blood\" around the spinal cord. He suffered from a herniated disc and was told to rest by doctors. To maintain the Kingdom's stability, Crown Prince Sultan returned from Morocco during the King's absence. The King was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital after a blood clot complicated a slipped disc and underwent successful back surgery. The lead surgeon was Muhammad Zaka, who probably removed the herniated disk and performed a lumbar fusion. He subsequently had another successful surgery in which surgeons \"stabilized a number of vertebras\". He left the hospital on 22 December 2010 and convalesced at The Plaza in New York City. On 22 January 2011, he left the United States and for Morocco, and returned to the Kingdom on 23 February 2011. King Abdullah left Saudi Arabia on \"special leave\" on 27 August 2012. Al-Quds reported that he had an operation at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, on or before 4 September 2012, following a heart attack. However, there was no official report on this alleged operation \u2013 instead, it was announced that the King went on a private trip to Morocco, where he is known to frequent. The King returned to Saudi Arabia from Morocco on 24 September. Nearly two months later, in November 2012, King Abdullah underwent another back surgery in Riyadh and left hospital on 13 December 2012. A report in April 2014 stated that the King had around six months left to live, citing a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer. On 2 January 2015, Abdullah was hospitalized in Riyadh for pneumonia and died on 23 January at the age of 90. Per Islamic tradition, his funeral was held the same day, a public ceremony at the Grand Mosque of Riyadh before burial in an unmarked grave at the Al Oud cemetery. Three days of national mourning were declared, in which flags would fly at half mast. Flags were also flown half-mast at Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey in London. While still Crown Prince, Abdullah paid for the separation surgery of a pair of Polish conjoined twins, which took place at the King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh on 3 January 2005. He was given \"honorary citizenship\" by the Polish town of Janikowo, where the twins were born. On 18 March 2005, he was awarded the Order of the Smile, which he received during his visit to Poland in 2007. He established two libraries: the King Abdulaziz Library in Riyadh; and another in Casablanca, Morocco. He donated over $300,000 to furnish a New Orleans high school rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina. He donated $500 million to the United Nations World Food Programme in 2008. He donated $50 million in cash and $10 million worth of relief materials for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China. He donated $10 billion to the endowment fund of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in May 2008. King Abdullah was, in 2012, named as the most influential Muslim among 500 Muslims for the previous 4 years. In December 2012, Forbes named him as the seventh most powerful figure in its list of the \"World's Most Powerful People\" for 2012, being the sole Arab in the top ten. King Abdullah received a number of international high orders. Most notably, he was an honoured knight of the strictly Roman Catholic Order of the Golden Fleece (the Spanish branch), which caused some controversy. In April 2012, he was awarded by the United Nations a gold medal for his contributions to intercultural understanding and peace initiatives. Malaysia : Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (1982) Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (2003) In 2011, the financial magazine Forbes estimated his and his immediate family's documentable wealth at US$21 billion, making him one of the world's richest monarchs. Abdullah was an expert equestrian in his youth. His stables were considered the largest in Saudi Arabia, with over 1,000 horses spread throughout five divisions led by his son Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah. The King also owned Janadria Farm, a large complex located in the suburbs of Riyadh. For holidays, the King maintained a large palace complex with several residential compounds in Casablanca, Morocco. It is equipped with two heliports and is surrounded by large mansions on 133 acres of vegetation. \"King Abdullah collected news and commentary\".

He had a range of business interests in the UAE and India (in Tamil Nadu) including maritime shipping, real estate, insurance etc. He founded numerous schools, colleges, hospitals and university. He was one of the 24 Indians to feature in The 500 Most Influential Muslims, an annual publication which ranks the most influential Muslims in the world. Abdur Rahman was the Vice-Chairperson of Emirates Trading Agency (commonly known as ETA Star) and Ascon Group, a Dubai-based conglomerate from 1973 to 2015. He is the founder of B. S.

He died on 7 January 2015 at the age of 87. Abdur Rahman pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organisations and concentrates on upliftment of economically weaker sections through the Seethakathi Trust & Zakaat Fund Foundation. B. S. Abdur Rahman was born in Kilakarai, Tamil Nadu, India, in a middle-class Marakkar family, the son of Bhukari Aalim. His father was a prominent Pearl Trader in South Asia. He completed his Secondary School Level at Schwartz School, Ramanathapuram & Hameedia High School, Kilakarai. He was blessed with four sons and two daughters.

At the age of fifteen, Abdur Rahman first went to Colombo with just \u20b9149. He worked as an errand boy for diamond merchants. He was at the time staying at rent-free accommodation with traders from Kilakarai but he had to fetch tea for them from a nearby hotel, clean the rooms and perform other menial tasks. A lesser person perhaps would have thrown in the towel. But Sena Aana was made of sterner stuff. Before long, he used his persuasive skills to obtain gemstones on credit from another merchant and began trading in them. In time he became a successful gem trader. The base that Abdur Rahman built in Ceylon was to help him in all his future activities. He began visiting Belgium, then as now, a centre of the gem trade, the USA, South America and set up business in Penang, Malaysia, Madras (now Chennai), Kolkata (then Calcutta), and then in Hong Kong. It was in Hong Kong that his business flourished. Incidentally, Abdur Rahman was the first person from Kilakarai to go to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong he launched the Precious Trading Company in 1954. Later, his very special brainchild, the Amana Group of Hong Kong, was established. It was under its banner that the multi-national company ETA-Ascon came into existence. BSA Rahman is credited as production facilitator in MGR Pictures' Ulagam Sutrum Valiban for film shoot in Hong Kong. ETA Group was started in Dubai in 1973 as a partnership with a friend, Abdullah Al-Ghurair, Chairman of the Al Ghurair Group of companies. The global asset bubble triggered by Nixon Shock catapulted him into a rupee billionaire in the 1970s; and diversification made him a dollar billionaire by the 1990s. Originally a civil construction contractor, ETA-Ascon expanded into trading, elevator and electrical installations, real estate, mechanical engineering, building maintenance, car dealerships, and, most recently, shipping and aviation. It employs over 54,000 people across 16 industry verticals. ETA-Ascon is today the flagship of BSA Rahman's vast industrial empire.

Abraham survived the ghetto in the city and the concentration camps during the years of German occupation of his country. Abraham's parents died in the Auschwitz concentration camp. After Auschwitz he spent time in three other concentration camps: Braunschweig, Watenstedt, and Ravensbr\u00fcck. On the night of May 1, 1945, he was released, weighing 28 kg (62 lb) and suffering from tuberculosis in both lungs, scurvy and dysentery. Among Abraham's 200 relatives he and his cousin were the only ones who survived. Ben Abraham spent the next two years being transferred between several American hospitals in Germany, eventually achieving a full recovery. According to him \"It was a miracle; that time tuberculosis cure did not even exist\". In 1947, after his recovery he clandestinely immigrated to Palestine. There Abraham witnessed another conflict, The War of Independence of the Israel State. He was not admitted to the army due to his health, so he bought an old truck and worked for the Israeli army as a driver. Abraham arrived in Brazil on January 21, 1955. On April 28, 1956 he married Miriam Dvora Brik, of a Ukrainian Jewish family from Lutsk. In Brazil, he was recruited by Mossad and cooperated with it until mid-90s.

His career long exploration of new subject matter, novel techniques and materials made his art dealer, James Mayor, describe him as Europe's equivalent of Robert Rauschenberg. Ivor Abrahams was born 10 January 1935 in Wigan, Lancashire to a Jewish family, the eldest of 2 children. Both parents were born in Manchester area - Ray (Rachael) n\u00e9e Kalisky / Kay and Harry (Hyman) Abrahams - but all four grandparents came from eastern Europe. He studied sculpture at Saint Martin's School of Art under Frank Martin and Anthony Caro 1952\u201354, and Camberwell School of Art under Karel Vogel and Martin Bloch 1954\u201357. In 1957, he became apprentice to the Fiorini Bronze Foundry, and went on to work as a display artist for Adel Rootstein. His first show, in 1960, was at the Portal Gallery with Peter Blake. Through Eduardo Paolozzi, he was included in the landmark 1961 ICA exhibition 26 Young Sculptors, together with Phillip King and Maurice Agis, friends from the St Martin's days. By the late 1960s Abrahams had found inspiration in the imagery of domestic gardens. As well as bronze, he started using new material for his work, nylon flocking, pre-vulcanized latex, styrene and plastics. After a solo show at the Richard Feigen Gallery in New York in 1970, he established his international reputation with a major museum show at the Kolnisher Kunstverein Cologne in 1973. In 1975, he met James Mayor who invited him to show the following year at the Mayor Gallery, thus beginning an association which continued till his death. Abrahams' print output includes his garden series and suites celebrating Edmund Burke and Edgar Allan Poe showcased in a Royal Academy exhibition in 2010. His body of prints was published by Bernard Jacobson who regularly exhibited his work in London and the US. In 1982, Bryan Robertson organised an exhibition of the sculptures at the Warwick Arts Trust and in 1984 he was invited to mount his first sculpture retrospective at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Abrahams' post-Cubist architectural structures of the 90s resulted in a commission by the Goodwood Sculpture Park and the purchase of the bronze 'Head of the Stairs' by the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea. In the 2000s a series of owls and cockerels, using various media, including enamel on steel epoxy resin and decal, culminated in the 2005 Mayor Gallery exhibition 'A Parliament of Owls'. 2007 saw a mini retrospective entitled 'The Four Seasons of Ivor Abrahams' at One Canada Square in Canary Wharf.

H. Abrams, was an American literary critic, known for works on romanticism, in particular his book The Mirror and the Lamp. Under Abrams's editorship, The Norton Anthology of English Literature became the standard text for undergraduate survey courses across the U. S. and a major trendsetter in literary canon formation. Abrams was the son of Eastern European Jewish immigrants in Long Branch, New Jersey. The son of a house painter and the first in his family to go to college, he entered Harvard University as an undergraduate in 1930. He went into English because, he says, \"there weren't jobs in any other profession. . . , so I thought I might as well enjoy starving, instead of starving while doing something I didn't enjoy. \" After earning his bachelor's degree in 1934, Abrams won a Henry Fellowship to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his tutor was I. A. Richards. He returned to Harvard for graduate school in 1935 and received a master's degree in 1937 and a Ph. D. in 1940. During World War II, he served at the Psycho-Acoustics Laboratory at Harvard. He describes his work as solving the problem of voice communications in a noisy military environment by establishing military codes that are highly audible and inventing selection tests for personnel who had a superior ability to recognize sound in a noisy background. In 1945 Abrams became a professor at Cornell University. The literary critics Harold Bloom, Gayatri Spivak and E. D. Hirsch, and the novelists William H. Gass and Thomas Pynchon were among his students. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963. As of March 4, 2008, he was Class of 1916 Professor of English Emeritus there. His wife of 71 years, Ruth, predeceased him in 2008. He turned 100 in July 2012. Abrams died on April 21, 2015 in Ithaca, New York, at the age of 102. Abrams shows that until the Romantics, literature was typically understood as a mirror reflecting the real world in some kind of mimesis; whereas for the Romantics, writing was more like a lamp: the light of the writer's inner soul spilled out to illuminate the world. In 1998, Modern Library ranked The Mirror and the Lamp one of the 100 greatest English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century. Abrams was not only the general editor of The Norton Anthology, he was the editor of The Romantic Period (1798\u20131832) in that anthology, and he evaluated writers and their reputations. In his introduction to Lord Byron, he emphasized how Byronism relates to Nietzsche's idea of the superman. In the introduction to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Abrams said, \"The tragedy of Shelley's short life was that intending always the best, he brought disaster and suffering upon himself and those he loved. \"To be clear, this anthology of \"English\" literature does not include Anglophone writers from places such as Canada, but it does include writers from various places in the British Isles, for instance, William Butler Yeats, who was appointed a senator in the Irish Free State. Literary theories, Abrams argues, can be divided into four main groups: Mimetic Theories (interested in the relationship between the Work and the Universe) Pragmatic Theories (interested in the relationship between the Work and the Audience) Expressive Theories (interested in the relationship between the Work and the Artist) Objective Theories (interested in close reading of the Work) The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition (1953) ISBN 978-0-19-501471-6 The Poetry of Pope: a selection (1954) ISBN 978-0-88295-067-9 Literature and Belief: English Institute essays, 1957.

He was member of the House of Representatives between 1989 and 1997 for the Islamic Action Front. He was an opponent of the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty and a supporter of Hamas. Abu Zant frequently criticized the Western world and especially the United States and Israel. He was also critical of moderate Islamic regimes in the Middle East. Abu Zant had confrontations with the Jordanian government several times. He was banned from delivering sermons in 1994 and was arrested several times for breaching that prohibition the same year. Critique of government actions against Hamas had him arrested in 1999 and 2001. Abu Zant was born in Nablus. At one point he became member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was elected to the House of Representatives during the 1989 Jordanian general elections. Abu Zant was a member of the House between 1989 and 1997 (or 1990 and 1998) for the Islamic Action Front (IAF), serving during three parliaments. Abu Zant called himself the leader of the most radical section of the party. Within the IAF Abu Zant had a sizeable group of followers. During his time in parliament Abu Zant supported introducing prohibition as well as a mandatory headscarf for Muslim women. When female Representative Faisal kept her own style of dress in parliament Abu Zant offered her an Islamic garb and sweets to stop wearing her own clothes and make-up. Abu Zant was an opponent of the Coalition forces during the Gulf War. He called the Gulf War: \"not a war between Iraq and the U. S. , but rather one between Islam and the infidels\". He subsequently called for a jihad against Western forces involved in the Gulf War. Abu Zant called the Arab regimes that took part in the Gulf War against Iraq apostates. During and after the Gulf War Abu Zant was a frequent speaker at Friday preaching ceremonies at mosques. In 1994 Abu Zant was prohibited from delivering sermons by the Ministry of Awqaf Islamic Affairs and Holy Places, after he criticized the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty, which had been signed that year. The same year he violated his prohibition when he spoke in a mosque criticizing the peace treacy. A scuffle occurred in which Abu Zant was injured, with Abu Zant and his followers and other preachers claiming the police acted violently, while the police blamed the followers of the official imam of the mosque, Sami al-Najjar, who had been prevented from delivering his own speech by Abu Zant. He later criticized official clerics in parliament, claiming that they were asking God to be merciful on Israelis, with Abu Zant referring to the Israelis as \"the killers of all God's emmissaries and prophets\". Shortly afterwards Abu Zant was arrested for criticizing an Amman court which was holding trials against people claimed of disturbing the peace during anti-peace treaty demonstrations. In 1994 Abu Zant wrote several articles in the newspaper Al Arab Al Yawm, which led to chief editor's arrest, as well as his own. In late November the two men were brought before a court on charges of slandering Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali. In September 1999 the governor of Amman, Qaftan Majali, asked Abu Zant to sign a pledge withholding him from keeping pro-Hamas speeches. Abu Zant refused and was placed under administrative arrest. In total he was arrested three times during the month for violating the Sermons Law of Jordan. Shortly before his arrest he had criticized a government crackdown on Hamas supporters, which happened in August. The Muslim Brotherhood subsequently demanded his release. During his life Abu Zant had been expelled from Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as his voiced opinions were deemed to radical. In 2001, with tensions relaxing between Israelis and Palestinians and a possible peace deal ahead, Jordan launched actions against Hamas. Both the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Action Front protested against these, although the protests were not large. Abu Zant however did protest fiercely, accusing the Jordanian government of collaborating with the United States and the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, which led to him being arrested. In 2014 during an interview on Al-Aqsa TV Abu Zant accused Jews of blood libel and cannibalism. Abu Zant died on 26 July 2015. Jordanian House Speaker Atef Tarawneh praised Abu Zant for his patriotism and dedication while being member of the House. Three days after his death Jordanian King Abdullah II visited Abu Zant's family to extend his condolences.

She is best known for co-creating Crossroads with Peter Ling. Hazel Joyce Willett was born in 1920 at Darjeeling, British India,, daughter of Ada \"Alma\" (Rhames) and Edward Willett, an engineer who work in Calcuta. At 9 months old, her British family returned to England, where her parents divorced in 1923, when she was two years old. Her mother later remarried Edward Hamblin, and she adopted his surname. In 1940, Hazel wed Gordon Mackenzie, a rancher from Brazil. The couple had one son Colin, afther WWII her husband returned to Brazil and they divorced in 1949. In 1950, Hazel remarried Ronald Marriott, an actor-writer, who died in 1972, and with whom she had 5 children. Using Adair as her stage name, she began her career as an actress with parts in the film My Brother Jonathan (1948) and the BBC television drama Lady Precious Stream (1950), originally a stage play by the British Chinese writer Hsiung Shih-I. She then turned her attention to writing scripts for radio and television. Together with her second husband, Ronald Marriott, she wrote Stranger from Space (1952), an episodic serial for the Whirligig children's television series. With Jonquil Antony (later Peter Ling), she wrote scripts for the radio soap opera Mrs Dale's Diary, and with Antony co-created ITV's first soap, Sixpenny Corner, which ran for eight months during 1955 and 1956, five days a week in a 15-minute slot. She formed a professional relationship with Peter Ling. The partnership created Compact (1962\u20135), based on her experiences working for Woman's Own, and the long-running Crossroads series. She recalled a working lunch with ATV head Lew Grade in August 1964 in which he requested the creation of a daily soap opera to be built around Noele Gordon, then in her mid-40s and under contract, to run from the following October. Adair and Ling quickly came up with the format, based around a widow, Meg Richardson, and her motel business. Despite limited production values, it became a hit, although a secondary storyline around the village shop of Richardson's sister was soon eliminated. Initially only screened in the Midland ATV franchise area from November, it was eventually taken up by the entire ITV network, and continued (in its original run) until 1988, although Adair's direct involvement lasted only until the mid-1970s. With Ling, she wrote for programmes such as Champion House (1967\u201368), which they also created, and for Doctor Who; the script by Adair and Ling for the latter was only produced as an audio book decades later. As a script writer on Emergency \u2013 Ward 10, she wrote what was long thought to be the first interracial kiss on television in Britain, broadcast in June 1964, but this has been found to be incorrect. Her other work, Compact, featured the first black actor to appear regularly (Horace James between August and October 1964) and the earliest unmarried mother in a soap, while Crossroads had the first black family to be included in the regular cast of a British soap. She had an intermittent career in the film industry. She wrote the script for Life in Emergency Ward 10 (1958), a spin-off film for which she was credited with the series' creator Tessa Diamond, and the Bob Monkhouse movie Dentist on the Job (1961) (with Hugh Woodhouse). In the 1970s she formed Pyramid Films with the broadcaster on wrestling, Kent Walton, with both adopting a joint nom de plume as the writers of the scripts. The company ventured into producing erotic films such as Virgin Witch (1971) and Game for Vultures (1979) and sex comedies such as Clinic Exclusive (1971) and Keep It Up Downstairs (1976). She drew on her experiences as an ambulance driver during second world war for a work of romantic fiction, Blitz on Balaclava Street (1983), published under the pseudonym of Clare Nicol. Adair was joint head of the Writer's Guild with Denis Norden and called a six-week strike in the 1960s, which eventually led Lew Grade agreeing to minimum wages and royalties for scriptwriters. She died on 22 November 2015, at the age of 95. She was survived by her six children, 11 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.

Adams was one of two finalists; Ford ultimately wound up successfully nominating the other finalist, John Paul Stevens. Adams retired outright from the bench (rather than taking senior status) on January 2, 1987. He returned to private practice, joining the firm Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis LLP. Adams was well known for his post-judiciary roles in significant legal cases. In 1994, he conducted an investigation of the Pennsylvania attorney general for alleged criminal activity, and investigated allegations of improper medical research at Fox Chase Cancer Center. Soon after in 1995, he was appointed to serve as a trustee in the New Era bankruptcy case, at that time the largest nonprofit bankruptcy in history. He also served as the Chapter 11 Trustee in the successful reorganization of the Coram Healthcare Corporation in the Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996. From 1998 to 2002, Adams served as independent counsel in an investigation of the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that uncovered widespread corruption. Adams service to society includes both legal and community capacities. Adams was a member of the Board of the Pennsylvania, and had previously served as a member of the board and Chairman of Albert Einstein Healthcare Network, trustee for the William Penn Foundation, the National Constitution Center, and Bryn Mawr College and President of the congregation for Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel. He was a former chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association and past president of both the American Judicature Society and American Philosophical Society. He also was the former chair of the U. S. Supreme Court Judicial Fellows Commission. He also briefly served as a co-trustee of the Roosevelt-Bentman Trust for American Voters. In 2001, Susquehanna University created the Arlin M. Adams Center for Law and Society, and in 2005, with the support of the Annenberg Foundation, the University of Pennsylvania Law School established the Arlin M.

J. Adams, also known as Bob Shannon (September 20, 1942 \u2013 January 26, 2015), was a Canadian film and television actor, acting coach, screen writer, film producer, documentary producer and radio personality. Adams was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, where he spent his early childhood, until his family headed across the border to Niagara Falls, New York. Known to his friends as Bob Adams, the aspiring actor/radio DJ spent just a couple of years attending Bishop Duffy High School before dropping out and moving to New York City at the age of 17 to study acting. Upon his arrival on the west coast, he landed a job as a page at NBC Burbank which led to a radio job in Phoenix and ultimately a twenty-five-year career in broadcasting as Bob Shannon. His on-air career included radio stations in markets such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Seattle, Minneapolis/St. Paul, San Diego and Los Angeles. It was while working at KFI (AM) in the mid-1970s that Adams turned his attention back to film acting. Adams began his 30-year radio career as Bob Shannon at KXIV Phoenix, Arizona until going full-time, thanks to the efforts of play-by-play announcer Al McCoy, who got him his first full-time on-air job at KBLU Yuma, Arizona. From there it was on to KUTY Palmdale, California before making the leap to KDWB St. Paul, Minnesota by the end of the year. It wasn't until Shannon arrived in Phoenix that he garnered his first major success at KRUX by rapidly climbing to number one in the market by beating all competitors by twenty plus points, utilizing a variety of crazy characters and outlandish antics such as the invasion of his show by the television rock group, The Monkees. The episode aired as the finale of the group's first season. Following his departure from Phoenix, Shannon held air shifts at WKBW Buffalo, New York and WKYC Cleveland, Ohio until landing the coveted early evening slot at KXOK St. Louis, Missouri where he again rose to the number one show in the market, beating his nearest rival by over twenty ratings points. Following St. Louis, Shannon joined a couple of famous stations, including KJR Seattle, Washington, WIXY Cleveland, Ohio and KDKA, before returning to KDWB Mpls/St. Paul as \"BS\" in the morning. It was here that he gained instant popularity by a myriad of stunts such as broadcasting live from the streets of the Twin Cities while distributing cans of beans during the gas shortage of the mid-1970s which he promoted as a \"natural gas substitute\". His name recognition eventually brought him to the attention of KFI Los Angeles in 1975, where he enjoyed several successful years doing afternoons as \"BS in Drive\". In 1976 Shannon with the help of his vast audience, as well as the national media, succeeded in persuading NOA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to adopt male hurricane names in an effort to bring equal hurricane rights to men. Up until that time hurricanes had only been named for women. His successful campaign brought about the naming of Hurricane David, the name of Shannon's son. From KFI, he went on to KHJ (AM) and KLAC, Los Angeles before retiring from radio in the mid-1980s to devote his attention to film acting. In 2000 Adams returned to the airwaves once again as Bob Shannon, this time joining the air staff of KRTH 101 in Los Angeles. He is not to be confused with a radio personality of the same name who is midday host on New York City's most popular radio station, classic-hits WCBS-FM. In 2003 he ventured into talk radio as host of Back Stage Live, a film and television call-in program specifically geared toward aspiring and professional actors on \"Smart Talk\" KRLA. In 2011, Adams played a serial-killing priest in a dark suspense thriller. From 1975 to 1978, Adams studied under acting coach Charles E. Conrad. He was cast in a variety of shows, including Hotel, The Practice, Archie Bunker\u2019s Place, General Hospital, Kojak and Hill Street Blues. From the 1980s to the 2000s, Adams appeared in dozens of film and television projects including Rocky IV, The Execution, Falling Through, and Murder, She Wrote, and was a series regular on Riptide. He starred in four feature films for which he wrote the screenplay: Abeo Pharisee, The Studio Club, Chasing Jose, and The Christmas Quilt. Shortly after leaving the Charles E. Conrad Studio in 1978, Adams began teaching a handful of actors from the local community college. That led to a 35-year coaching career at The Actors Workshop. His former students include Kristy Swanson, Brian Krause, Sarah Lancaster. Vicellous Reon Shannon, Schae Harrison, and Annet Mahendru. Adams appeared as a panelist for the Screen Actors Guild Foundation and conducted SAG-AFTRA acting workshops in Los Angeles and San Diego. In 1976, Adams founded Shannon & Company, which served Orange County and Los Angeles as a full service advertising agency until the company converted to a broadcast and film production company in the 1980s, focusing primarily on historical documentary projects and docudramas. The company rolled out a number of films, including Ruins of the Reich, The Missions of California, Order Castles of the Third Reich and The Final Journey. Ownership of Shannon & Company changed when R. J. Adams' son, Rob Adams, took control of the company in the spring of 2000 and steered the company toward the production of feature films and episodic television. Adams and his wife, Diane, were married for 47 years. His son, actor Rob Adams, is an acting coach at The Actors Workshop. Adams was an FAA licensed IFR/Commercial pilot and flew various planes ranging from the Cessna 150 to the Cessna CE 550 corporate jet. Adams died of a heart attack on January 26, 2015. He was 72. R.

Adeane was born in 1939 into a prominent landed family, the son of Michael Adeane (created a life peer as Baron Adeane in 1972) and Helen Chetwynd-Stapylton, the daughter of Richard Chetwynd-Stapylton. The family had a long history of service to the royal family. His maternal great-grandfather was Arthur Bigge, later Lord Stamfordham, private secretary to Queen Victoria and King George V. His paternal great-grandfather was Admiral Edward Stanley Adeane. Edward was educated at Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he graduated with an MA. He was a Page of Honour to The Queen from 1954 to 1956. In 1960\u20131961 he was a Plebiscite Supervisor in the Southern Cameroon. He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in July 1962, and specialised in libel until 1979. As a barrister he defended Time Out magazine, owned by Playboy Publications, Inc. , in 1973, when they had accused Fiona Lewis, an actress, of being involved with South American revolutionaries. She was awarded damages. The following year, he represented The Spectator magazine who had libeled publishers Jonathan Cape, suggesting they were in financial difficulties, and won a similar outcome in that case. In 1975 he was more successful in representing Marcia, Lady Falkender, who was falsely accused of forging the signature of her boss, former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. She was paid damages and costs. In 1977, Adeane represented Marlene Dietrich, the glamorous Hollywood actress, in a libel case brought by producer Alexander Cohen and Brentwood TV, of New York, for breach of contract, as a disreputable performer. Adeane was appointed Private Secretary and Treasurer to the Prince of Wales in May 1979 to succeed Sqdr Ldr David Checketts. Prince Charles and Edward Adeane shared a passion in angling on the River Test near Stockbridge, Hampshire. They were members of the Houghton Fishing Club, where Adeane continued to fish right up until his last days. On the engagement of Lady Diana Spencer and the Prince, she was due to arrive at Albany House, where Adeane had a barrister's set. The staff expected octogenarian Lady Diana Cooper, but were bemused to find a much younger lady arrive in her Mini Metro and park perfectly. Princess Diana had a nervous start in a royal household, where she dismissed almost all of the staff. Adeane was made the Princess's Treasurer in 1981 on their marriage. Adeane was granted the additional appointment as private secretary to the Princess in 1984, following Oliver Everett's resignation. The alleged trouble started during the 1983 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, when the Princess first expressed concern at leaving her children behind in London. The Daily Mirror reported her calling Adeane a \"fuddy-duddy\". When Adeane tried to plan a tour of Australia in 1984, he was accused of trying to manipulate State elections in Victoria for political purposes. In attempting to distance the Premier, Adeane was quoted in the Daily Mirror and other newspapers. The controversy behind the scenes stirred royal watchers to speculate that all was not well with the royal marriage when finally, the Prince and Princess of Wales stepped onto the Canberra tarmac early in October 1985. \"Obviously the key to this confusion will depend on whether Prince Charles wishes to adhere to the advice given in your letter of 15 May 1984, or not!\" exclaimed a rather uppity courtier. The prince had changed the itinerary on several points, leaving an exasperated secretary to make a number of public pronouncements. What made matters worse was what assistant secretary called a \"bombshell\" dropped by RAAF which refused to carry the royal couple from Heathrow, but could only pick up from Bahrain or Singapore. Angry at being told to 'wait around' at foreign airports, Prince Charles deplored the chaos, and ultimately 'heads would roll. ' It did not help matters that Major Ronald Ferguson, royal polo manager was embroiled in the disorganized mess on board. The Australians objected to the mounting costs to the taxpayer; and the Americans suggested that on their leg, the RAF pick them up from Washington DC. Ironically Prince Charles cut the itinerary down to avoid inappropriate and stressful visits and not cost. But the consequences added to the growing disharmony in the royal household, for which Adeane had primary responsibility. Adeane resigned after disagreements and accusations that he was taking decisions without consulting the prince, and being too much of the 'old school tie' about him. However Adeane found that the prince invariably did the opposite of what he was advised. An almost unprecedented state of affairs materialized on 19 March 1985, when the press were invited into Buckingham Palace to discuss relations. Evidently the last straw for Adeane he resigned on 31 March 1985. He was Equerry to the Prince of Wales 1979\u20131981, and was an Extra Equerry from 1985. He represented the Prince at Royal Household memorial services - and returned to practice at the Bar. His departure commenced a period of instability in royal sinecures, including the Queen's annus horribilis, with several private secretaries coming and going in short order. He was replaced by Sir John Riddell. Adeane may have lost the prince's favour, but he continued to be a regular guest of the Queen Mother at Birkhall every September for the grouse shooting season. From 1993 he was Trustee of the British Library, and trustee of the Leeds Castle Foundation 1991, and the Lambeth Palace Library 1991. A likeable man, and a popular figure, Adeane was not sporty at school but flourished in country pursuits later in life. He habitually ate out every meal, even at breakfast. He was a company director from 1985, including of Hanson since 1992; Hambros Bank 1986 (executive director, compliance since 1991); Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance 1985; English and Scottish Investors Plc 1986; and Hambros Channel Islands Trust Corp Ltd. Adeane was appointed a CVO in 1985. He died on 20 May 2015. Adeane never married and is survived by companion, Brent Snape.

Adkins (October 25, 1932 \u2013 July 16, 2015) was a professor emeritus of psychology and education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Adkins was born in Beirut, Syria (now Lebanon) to Turkish and Syrian missionaries Leslie John Adkins and Edith Sanderson. Adkins was a graduate of Phillips Academy and in 1955 became an alumni at Princeton University along with a classmate Ralph Nader. For 12 years, Adkins served in the US Navy starting from Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps and climbing up the ranks to a naval officer on the USS Salem and even serving on a flagship of the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean waters. While there, he also received training in Naval Justice School, served on various vessels as court marshal, and later became attendee of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Following his service, Adkins returned to Columbia, where in 1958 he got his master's degree in psychology. In 1963, after obtained his doctorate in counseling psychology from Teachers College, Columbia University, Adkins immediately joined its faculty in order to work on his Career Pattern Study. For one year, he moved to Harvard University where he spent at its Center for Personality, studying achievement motivation with David McClelland. After his short lived Harvard appointment, Atkins indulged into War on Poverty and worked with YMCA of the City of Greater New York. In 1966, Adkins became a founding faculty member of the York College, City University of New York, where he supervised the Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge project. The project later turned into a program whose goal is to provide support for low income students. The program is still used today by the City University System. During the next 30 years, Adkins worked at Teachers College, Columbia University and at the Institute for Life Coping Skills, where he developed new methods for helping people to deal with complex attitudes and behaviors they might encounter in their everyday life. His major focus was the development of multi-media counseling systems. Adkins then worked with Paul Sharar and Sidney Rosenberg to develop Training Resources for Youth, a program that was implemented by 2,000 agencies in 40 states ever since its founding in late 1970s. During his career, Adkins trained many graduate students on how to develop psychological and behavioral interventions, using his methods and theory. He served on many non-profit boards of directors, including the HOPE Program for the homeless, the NYS Advisory Group on Adult Education, the Greenwich Adult and Continuing Program and the Center for Insurance Research, and was a founding member of the Princeton Project '55 Center for Civic Leadership. Adkins is better known as a pioneer behind the Adkins Life Skills Career Development Program (ASLP), which was originally published by Psychological Corporation, a division of Harcourt Assessment. The program, which besides English comes in Spanish and Italian languages, helped over 1 million people to obtain degrees (and later jobs). The program was used by over 2,000 agencies in 45 states, which includes such facilities as prisons, homeless shelters, drug rehabilitation centers, welfare-to-work programs, economic opportunity centers and community colleges. Based off the program, the Institute for Life Coping Skills had trained over 5000 staff as Life Skills Educators who promoted the program in their own agencies. Later on, as many as 200 community colleges in India had adopted the Life Coping Skills curriculum which was used in their country to help students from rural provinces learn how to understand urban life. Adkins died following lung surgery at the of age 82. He was married to professor emerita, Caroline Manuele Adkins, who is also a psychologist.

Adrian moved from Canada to Vienna, Austria in 1972 where he became known for creating experimental artworks using radio and communications technologies. His work The World in 24 Hours, which connected artists in different cities and continents through telephone lines and radio, is considered to be one of the first experiments in online culture. Adrian is considered to be a pioneer in the field of telecommunications art and media art. Adrian was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on February 22, 1935. He moved to Vienna in 1972. Adrian was an early user of telecommunications and electronics technologies for artistic purposes. One of his earliest telecommunications projects, in collaboration with Bill Bartlett, was a work that used the business computer network of the company I. P. Sharp Associates, which Adrian had learned about and gained access to through fellow artist Norman White. Called Interplay, the piece was a telecommunications event that linked a dozen cities in Canada, the US, Australia, Austria and Japan on April 1, 1979. Following Interplay, Bartlett and Adrian organized and implemented of one of the first electronic mail systems for artists in 1979/1980. This again used the I. P. Sharp Associates computer network, this time from its Vienna office. Adrian was instrumental in setting up the system ARTBOX (later renamed to ARTEX) in 1979 for mail and media artists to use to communicate between each other. In 1982, Adrian organized Die Welt in 24 Stunden (The World in 24 Hours), a telecommunications work that used telephone lines and slow-scan television to link sixteen cities on three continents together. The piece is widely cited as an early example of networked electronic art and online culture. It was commissioned by and presented at Ars Electronica Linz. In 2009, Adrian was a co-recipient of the US$50,000 Nam June Paik Art Center Prize. Adiran died in Vienna on September 7, 2015.

Aeby (; August 16, 1923 \u2013 June 19, 2015) was an American environmental physicist most famous for having taken the only well-exposed color photograph of the first detonation of a nuclear weapon on July 16, 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test site in New Mexico. Jack Aeby was born on August 16, 1923 in Mount City, Missouri, United States. In 1942, Aeby joined the Manhattan Project by filling out an employment application in Albuquerque. He did a lot of jobs, including ferrying scientists and equipment between Albuquerque and Los Alamos. Though a civilian, he worked his way up into the SED (Special Engineering Detachment) in technician roles and eventually witnessed nearly 100 nuclear explosions. After getting his degree at UC Berkeley after the war, he returned, in the Health Physics Department. On July 16, 1945, Aeby took the only well-exposed color photograph of the first detonation of a nuclear weapon at the Trinity nuclear test site in New Mexico. While color motion pictures of the Trinity test were made, most were badly overexposed or damaged due to the fireball's tendency to blister and solarize the film. Aeby was a civilian assigned to the Physics Group 5 with Emilio Segr\u00e8 and Owen Chamberlain at the time his snapshot was taken. The photo was taken with a Perfex 33 with a 35mm lens, using a shutter speed of 1/100 at f4 and Anscochrome color movie stock film. Aeby was not an official observer at the test site, but was invited along to take informal photos of the work, which he had commonly done since he arrived at Los Alamos. He says he took the photos of the blast on a whim, \"it was there so I shot it\". He took the film, a non-standard piece of Ansochrome movie stock film, out of the camera that night at a local photo lab, and worked it through the 21 step procedure for color film developing. Later on, Los Alamos management asked him if they could keep the original negative \"for safe keeping\". It has since been lost. Aeby says in most uses of the photo it is reversed. This was done intentionally so that the asymmetrical fireball and cloud would look the same as other official pictures taken from the north; Aeby was on the south at the Base Camp when he took the picture. Aeby is a source for a story about a notable estimate made by Enrico Fermi at that test: As the shock wave hit Base Camp, Aeby saw Enrico Fermi with a handful of torn paper. \"He was dribbling it in the air. When the shock wave came it moved the confetti. \" Fermi had just estimated the yield of the first nuclear explosion at the equivalent of 10,000 tons of TNT. Later measures put the yield nearly twice as much, at 18. 6 kilotons. And this terrible new energy came from a plutonium ball weighing 13. 6 pounds. Aeby lived in the Espa\u00f1ola Valley in northern New Mexico with his wife Jeanne. They had 5 children. Aeby died at his home in Espa\u00f1ola in 2015.

Soshana was a full-time artist and traveled frequently, exhibiting her work internationally. During her journeys, she portrayed many well known personalities and her art developed in different directions. Her early period artwork was largely naturalistic in nature, showing landscapes and portraits. Later her style developed towards abstract art, strongly influenced by Asian calligraphy. Soshana Afroyim was born in 1927 as Susanne Sch\u00fcller in Vienna into a Jewish middle-class family. Her younger brother Maximilian was born two years later. Her father, Fritz Sch\u00fcller, owned a cufflink factory and her mother, Margarethe Sch\u00fcller, was a sculptor. Shoshana first went to the Rudolf Steiner School, but soon changed to the alternative Schwarzwald School. She started to paint and draw at a very young age. Her mother supported Shoshana's creativity and collected her works. At the age of eleven, Shoshana witnessed the annexation of Austria. \"I watched Hitler's triumphant entry to Vienna. I remember well how I looked out of the window (. . . ) and saw how he was welcomed by the cheering crowd as he drove in his open car (. . . ). I turned cold and was horribly frightened. \"The family decided to leave Austria. Fritz Sch\u00fcller, who had been born in Brno, had a Czech passport and left the country first. Margarethe, Shoshana and Maximilian fled to Switzerland, then Paris, where Fritz had waited for them and finally in 1939 they reached London, where they would stay two years. Shoshana attended the Northwood College and in 1940 the Chelsea Polytechnic School, where she had painting and drawing lessons and learned about fashion design. Due to the Blitz, the Schueller family had to take refuge in air-raid shelters almost every night. The experience was very stressful for Soshana. She expressed her stress and emotions through drawings. Soshana's father fled to Spain and via Tangier, followed by New York. In 1941 he managed to get an affidavit for his family and booked three tickets for the S. S. Madura, the last civil ship that would leave Europe. In 1941, Soshana, her mother and her brother arrived at Ellis Island. In New York City. She enrolled at Washington Irving High School and attended painting classes under the guidance of artist Beys Afroyim, future plaintiff-appellant in Afroyim v. Rusk. At the age of 17, she travelled against her parents' will with Beys Afroyim through America. To earn their living during these travels, they painted writers, musicians, statesmen and scientists like Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter, Lion Feuchtwanger, Theodore Dreiser and Hanns Eisler. When the United Nations Conference on International Organization was opened in May 1945 in San Francisco, the couple portrayed well-known delegates, such as the deputy chairman of the UdSSR national planning commission Vasilij Vasilevi\u010d Kuznecov. In 1945, Soshana and Afroyim married. In 1946. their only child Amos was born in New York. Because of Beys' activities within the Communist Party, the couple left the USA and spent nine months in Cuba, where Soshana had her first exhibition in 1948 at the Circulo de Bellas Artes, Havana. From that time on she used the name \"Soshana\", the nom de plume Afroyims gave her, meaning \"Lily\" in Hebrew (the more common spelling is Shoshana - \u05e9\u05d5\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4). After a short stay in the USA, they moved to Europe and eventually to Israel. The family was financially poor and Soshana didn't want to live her life as a traditional housewife. They divorced in 1950 with mutual consent. She returned with her son to Vienna in 1951. Soshana returned to Vienna with her son and eventually gave Beys full custody. In 1951, she enrolled at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna and in 1952 to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where she painted under the guidance of Prof. Sergius Pauser, Albert Paris G\u00fctersloh and Prof. Herbert Boeckl. Unhappy with academic art practice, she relocated in Paris, France in 1952. Upon relocation to Paris, Soshana lived and worked in the former studio of Andr\u00e9 Derain. She eventually moved into another studio at Impasse Ronsin next to Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. She became very close with the artist, whom she described as loving her \"like a daughter. \" Later, she lived in another studio that was previously owned by Gauguin. Soshana struggled financially as a full-time artist in Paris. She described it as a \"bittersweet time. \" She became acquainted with the artists Kupka, Auguste Herbin, Ossip Zadkine, C\u00e9sar, Pignon, Bazaine, Max Ernst, Yves Klein, Alexander Calder, Wifredo Lam, Sam Francis, Jean-Paul Sartre, Affandi, Lain Bangdel, and Marc Chagall. She considered Alberto Giacometti one of her best friends. In 1953, Soshana met the Zurich gallery owner Max G. Bollag, who became a major promoter of her work. In Paris, Soshana had multiple exhibitions in the Andr\u00e9 Weil Gallery and Salon d'Automne, the Salon des R\u00e9alit\u00e9s Nouvelles and the Salon de Mai, where she met Pablo Picasso for the first time. He invited her to visit him at his Villa in Vallauris and drew a portrait of her in 1954. In 1956, Soshana traveled through Asia. She had organised herself an invitation by for a Chinese Ministry of Culture to exhibit in Beijing and on her way to China, she visited India, Thailand, Cambodia and Japan, where became interested in and inspired by Indian philosophy, Hinduism and Buddhism. She was impressed by the art of calligraphy and learned art techniques on rice paper from Buddhist monks in Kyoto and Chinese painters in Hangzhou. The art of calligraphy became formative for her painting style. In 1957 she arrived in Beijing, where her exhibition took place in the Emperor's palace. In 1959 Soshana travelled through Africa, where she portrayed Albert Schweitzer in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, eventually returning to Paris. In the same year she became acquainted with the Italian artist Pinot Gallizio. They worked together in Paris and Alba del Piemonte, Italy. In a letter written by Gallizio, to his gallerist Otto and Heicke Van de Loo in Munich, he announced '20 paintings were made in September 1959 in Paris, together with Soshana', adding 'results formidable'. Through Gallizio, Soshana got in contact with the COBRA group, among others to Karel Appel and Asger Jorn. But because she is a woman, they did not accept her as a full member of the art group. Instead, Soshana started a collaboration with the O\u00b4Hana Gallery in London, where she had three exhibitions in 1959, 1960 and 1963. In 1962, she had an exhibition at Ch\u00e2teau Grimaldi in Antibes. In 1964, Soshana traveled to Mexico for various exhibitions, living many months in Cuernavaca, known as the \"City of Eternal Spring\" and a refuge for many artists and intellectuals of the 1960s. She became friends with Mexican artists such as Rufino Tamayo, Siqueiros, Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas and Mathias Goeritz. In 1965, she met Adolph Gottlieb for the first time and later in New York, they developed a deep friendship. In 1966, an exhibition of Soshana's work took place in the Palacio de Bellas Artes. During the course of her second trip around the world in 1968, Soshana visited the South Seas, the Caribbean, Thailand, Bali, Australia, India, Sikkim, Nepal, Afghanistan, Iran and Israel. In 1969, the Chogyal entrusted her with painting portraits of the king and the queen of Sikkim and the same year she became a member of the Theosophical Society. In 1972, Soshana moved to Jerusalem, where she planned four exhibitions in the Old Jaffa Gallery. But when the Yom Kippur War broke out, they were all cancelled. Soshana left Israel and moved 1974 to New York. From 1974 to 1985, she lived and worked in New York City. Before she moved into her studio in Queens, she stayed in the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan, where she was able to pay her rent with paintings. Soshana knew many people of the New York art scene, like Mark Rothko, Francesco Clemente, Joseph Hirshhorn and her close friend Adolph Gottlieb. Despite gaining international attention for her work and exhibiting frequently, Soshana felt unsatisfied with her living situation and uncomfortable in New York. She returned to Vienna in 1985. Upon her return to Vienna, she continued to travel until she had to stop due to health problems in 2005. Thereafter, she moved to a nursing home and continued to paint. She died on December 9, 2015. Her son, Amos, serves as her manager and promoter. In 2008, the Austrian National Library took over her creative estate, comprising manuscripts, photos, letters, documents etc. and made it available for public consultation. In her early work, Soshana links individual elements from the tradition of Fauvism with the compact, hermetic view of American Realism and is noticeably imbued with a spirit of youthful insouciance. Soshana received her first lasting artistic influences at an art school in New York City, starting at the age of fourteen. Before she started to create abstract paintings in the early 50's, she painted in a style of colorful, archaizing Realism. A style, which is connected to the political art in the period around 1945, as a minor transition phase between the earlier and more famous Realisms of the 1930s (New Objectivity, Verismo, Precisionism, Magical Realism, etc. ) and the abstract painting of the 1950s. Already the bombings of the London Blitz, had triggered artistic reflections in the drawing of the budding artist Soshana. Her teacher in New York and later husband Beys Afroyim, who was a committed Communist, led her much deeper into narrative art and contemporary Social Realism. Afroyim and Soshana were very involved in the political activistic New York art circles, consisting mainly of European immigrants. On her travels with Beys Afroyim through the USA and later Cuba, Israel and Europe, Soshana painted street sceneries (e. g. Old Street in NY City, 1943, or Street in L. A. , 1945), factory workers (e. g. the series My Sweatshop in New York, 1944), people she met on the way(e. g. Two Black Youths, 1944, oder Young Man with a Straw, 1945) and many landscapes. Overmore she portrayed many artists and politicians (e. g. Franz Werfel on his deadbed, 1945, or Otto Klemperer, 1945). These portraits reflect the critical intellectual environment, the Afroyim couple moved in. All of the persons depicted have a distinctly melancholic look and are all either frontal or three-quarter-view portraits, which focus completely on the person represented. From the perspective of bold Social Realism, she interpreted the psychology of European immigrants in Los Angeles and European delegates to the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco. Soshanas working-class milieu studies on the other hand show a high affinity with famous regionalists and socialrealists such as Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, the Soyer Brothers or the Mexican Muralists Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera. Up to 1948, Soshana remained faithful to a compact, colorful and expressive Social Realism. In these early paintings, figures are modeled roughly with a few broad brush strokes without any detail; landscapes and citiscapes always open up to the beholder from a slightly elevated point of view. The scenes appear mostly in a neutral light, with neither houses nor figures casting shadows, yet these landscapes with the saturated application of colors, exude an almost cheerful mood, which can be interpreted as an echo of Fauvism. Soshana's paintings of European Alpine landscapes, which she began creating upon her return to Vienna in 1951, already show her first steps into Art Informel. When Soshana moved to Paris in 1952, she became part of the so-called \u00c9cole de Paris, a representative of the Paris School. Influenced by the intense contact with other artists from all over the world, Soshana turned her style from Expressive Realism into the Informel. Step by step she eliminated the object from her paintings and followed suit with the international art jargon of the time after 1945. Her Paris paintings are being connected with Abstract Expressionism and compared by experts to those of Jackson Pollock, Georges Mathieu and Hans Hartung. From the second half of the 1950s, Soshanas works increasingly show informel characteristics. Like so many other artists of her time, she was fascinated by Asian calligraphic aesthetics and the philosophy behind it. She had many Asian friends in Paris (e. g. Tobashi, Fujino, Walasse Ting) and made her first experiments with calligraphic techniques. But the decisive impulse for an intense engagement in studies of traditional Far Eastern art was her first journey to Asia in 1957. She learned how to use Chinese ink on paper and soon applied the new technique on her oil paintings. Although she devoted a big part of her work to the abstract art, Soshana never completely gave up the representational and kept interweaving occasional figures into her paintings. Many of Soshana's paintings contain Surrealistic motives, like an infinite horizon, expanded endless spaces, in which mysterious shapes, masks or heads seem to float. The use of an Surrealistic language is due to Soshana's travels to Mexico. In 1960 she made her first visit to that country, which was \u2013 due to its political antifaschist position - at that time particularly appealing for artists and intellectuals from Europe. Soshana is one of those \"children of the language of painting in Mexico\", a \"pintora filomexicana\". All her life she had a deep and magic connection with the country, which is also reflected in her work. The paintings she created in Mexico or are reminiscent of Mexico have a very special character, they hold within the typical flamboyant colors and the contrasts of that country. Soshana refined a technique, she once had developed by chance in her Paris studio years before, when it had rained through the leaky glass roof onto her watercolours and dried, leaving bright spots with dark edges. Soshana began to imitate this effect with turpentine on her oil paintings, the result was a \"kind of drip painting in reverse\" which resembled the structure of liquid crystal, as she describes herself: \"Some biochemists say that my paintings resemble what you see, when you look into a microscope\" A lonely figure, a dark silhouette or a single head between heavy bars, surrounded by wild strokes inside the perspective of a tunnel \u2013 motives like these run like a red thread through Soshanas whole work and have earned her a reputation as \"Cassandra of the canvas, a prophetess of doom, an artist of the Atomic Age, a painter of anxiety and loneliness, of disease and dementia, of unemployment, pain, and death. \" (The Mainichi, Japan 1957) Soshana was seriously affected by political events since her childhood. At the age of 11, she watched Hitler marching into Vienna, later the family had to flee from the Nazi regime. Soshana used drawing and painting as an outlet to deal with these traumatic events, like in a drawing, she called \"Hitler as Cloun\". Themes like The Cold War, the Yom Kippur War, the atomic age or terrorism can be found over and over again in Soshana's Oeuvre. When she returned to Vienna in 1985, she worked up the time of the Nazi regime and the Holocaust. During Kurt Waldheim's election campaign in 1987/88, she made a series of paintings and collages, in which she incorporated Nazi propaganda texts. Soshana also painted motive cycles of the wars in Yugoslavia, the attacks on the World Trade Center or the wars on Iraq. Reminiscences on earlier series of works and a process of compression can be clearly noted in Soshana's late work. From the 2000s on, her paintings get a very different character, the structures are more quiet, the colours clearer and the forms more simple. The motives sometimes even seem childish and naive, these pictures are little riddles full of irony and phantasy.

The foreign press paradoxically always has seen her as an Austrian painter. , Today she is often labelled as a cosmopolitan, a globetrotter, whose work is influenced by experiences on all the continents. \". . . ranging in style from more or less abstract impressionism to tachistic calligraphy, Soshana\u00b4s paintings represent a diary of her travels showing, page by page, the impressions and visual experiences evoked on her journeys. \" (Pierre Restany, art historian and art critic, Paris 1969) \"A woman who creates art lives in a test situation, and the examiner can be anyone at all. Because every man and every woman 'knows' what a woman is; therefore every man and every woman can claim the right to reduce the assessment of a woman's art to what she is like as a woman. \"At Soshana's time, an art career for a woman was by no means a matter of course. The goal of being able to support oneself by one's own art production seemed \u2013 not only for women \u2013 nearly impossible, which is why many aspiring women artists completed practical training in some other profession parallel to their art schooling. In most cases it was the teaching profession, which they practiced in art-related spheres. But Soshana chose her own independent self-determined and emancipated way, in an era in which the legal implementation of equal rights of men and women and equal opportunities to work in any profession was simply unthinkable. In a letter to the co-author of her autobiography, she writes about her role as a pioneer: \"This is why I want to write this book, to say what a struggle I went through to be a woman and an artist and be maybe like 100 years ahead of the times we actually live in. \"A good example of how hard it was as a woman artist on the market, is the fact, that even a revolutionary artist group like CoBrA, refused her as a member out of sexistic reasons. And the gallerist of her colleague Pinot Gallizio, with whom she made many paintings, did not want her to sign with Gallizio on the same work. In the manuscript of her autobiography, Soshana writes about the rejection she encountered also by other gallery owners: \"The owner of the Galerie de France told me in no uncertain terms, that they did not like to take woman artists on contract, it was considered too risky. A woman could get married, have children and abandon her career. Twenty years of publicity and a long-term financial investment in a female artist would be ruined over-night. Since this did not apply in my case, I felt the discrimination against women all the more. \"For a very long time, the role of a woman in arts was to be an inspiring muse, not to be a painter herself. But Soshana understood that she had to develop her own individual, unique artist image and knew very well how to practice successful self-management. She spread exciting, mysterious stories of her life and created a hype around her person. Her encounters with Picasso were told again and again - especially the story of the day, when she visited him in his villa in Vallauris, to be portrayed and the refused his invitation to stay with him. Soshana tried to use Picassos name to get more attention. The planned booktitel of a never finished autobiographical novel would have referred to that event: The Girl who said No to Picasso. Still Soshana later mentioned very often that she was torn between her pride of having said \"No\" and the regret, not to have chosen the easier and safe way at the side of a man.

He was known for his fiction centered on World War II, as well as his biographies and essays. Agawa was born in Hiroshima, Japan. As a high school student Agawa was influenced by the Japanese author Naoya Shiga. He entered the Tokyo Imperial University to study Japanese literature. Upon graduation in 1942, Agawa was conscripted to serve in the Imperial Japanese Navy, where he worked as an intelligence officer breaking Chinese military codes until the end of the war. He returned to Hiroshima, where his parents had experienced the atomic bomb, in March 1946. After World War II Agawa wrote his first short story Nennen Saisai (Years upon Years, 1946), which was a classic I Novel, or autobiographical novel, recounting the reunion with his parents. It follows the style of Naoya Shiga, who is said to have praised the work. August 6 as Agawa notes in a postscript, combines the stories of friends and acquaintances who experienced the bombing into the testimony of one family. Occupation censorship at the time was strict, but the story passed because, the author later observed, \"it made no reference to the problems of after-effect and continued no overt criticism of the U. S. \" Agawa came to popular and critical attention with his Citadel in Spring (\u6625\u306e\u57ce, 1952), which was awarded the Yomiuri Prize. (He later revisited the same theme of his experiences as a student soldier in Kurai hato (Dark waves, 1974)). Ma no isan (Devil's Heritage, 1953), a documentary novel, is an account of the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a young Tokyo reporter, handling, among other topics, the death of his Hiroshima nephew and survivors' reactions to the Atomic bomb Casualty Commission, the U. S. agency that conducted research on atomic victims. Agawa's four major biographical novels are Yamamoto Isoroku (\u5c71\u672c\u4e94\u5341\u516d, 1965), Yonai Mitsumasa (\u7c73\u5185\u5149\u653f, 1978), Inoue Seibi (\u4e95\u4e0a\u6210\u7f8e, 1986), and Shiga Naoya (\u5fd7\u8cc0\u76f4\u54c9, 1994). His other major works include Kumo no bohyo (Grave markers in the clouds, 1955), and Gunkan Nagato no shogai (The life of the warship Nagato, 1975). Agawa was awarded the Order of Culture (Bunka Kunsho) in 1999.

His work has been published in books and is held in public collections. He was a member of the In-Public street photography collective. Agou was born in Montbrison, France in 1969. A self-taught photographer, Agou grew up in a small town in the Forez region, on the eastern side of the Massif Central. From the early 1990s, Agou made documentary-style photographs in both black and white and color which take an allusive approach to the human condition. He also made short films and sculpture. In 1992, he moved to New York City. He began taking photographs in the streets that evoked a sense of longing and isolation. He made photographs at Ground Zero on September 11th, 2001, which were used in numerous publications. He first came to prominence with photographs taken in the New York City Subway, published in his book Life Below (2004). In 2002 Agou returned to Forez. He traveled to the lesser-known parts of the region and got to know a community of family farmers whose identities are deeply rooted to the land. He photographed and filmed them at work and at home for eight years. This resulted in Face au Silence / In the Face of Silence, a documentary about rural life in early twenty-first century France. The work won him the 2010 European Publishers Award for Photography, and publication in six editions and in six languages. He became a member of the In-Public street photography collective in 2005.

He was the real-life son of lucha libre legend Perro Aguayo and not a storyline \"Junior\". Aguayo was best known as the leader of the Los Perros del Mal stable, which he started in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in mid-2004. The stable became a significant draw in Mexican professional wrestling, peaking during Aguayo's storyline rivalries with M\u00edstico and H\u00e9ctor Garza. In October 2008, Aguayo left CMLL to start his own independent professional wrestling promotion Perros del Mal Producciones, built around members of his Los Perros del Mal stable. In June 2010, Aguayo returned to AAA after a seven-year absence to start an invasion storyline involving his stable. Aguayo died on March 21, 2015, due to a freak accident during a wrestling match, which was covered extensively by many news outlets across the world. Following his death, Aguayo was inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. Pedro Aguayo Ram\u00edrez was born on July 23, 1979, in Mexico City, Mexico, the son of Luz Ram\u00edrez and Pedro Aguayo Dami\u00e1n, a luchador, or professional wrestler known under the ring name Perro Aguayo. His uncle, Jes\u00fas Ram\u00edrez \u00c1ngel, was better known under the name \u00cddolo and his cousins competed as \u00cddolo I and \u00cddolo II. Aguayo's cousin works as \"Pepe Aguayo\", inspired by Perro Sr. Debuting professionally at the age of 15, Aguayo Jr. started out wrestling established veterans in AAA. He often teamed with his father, and the pair won the Mexican National Tag Team Championship on two occasions, defeating the teams of Fuerza Guerrera/Mosco de la Merced and El Cobarde II/El Cobarde Jr. , respectively. Aguayo Jr. worked his first major show on June 18, 1995, when he faced and lost to Juventud Guerrera as part of Tripleman\u00eda III-B. Aguayo Jr. formed a team of all \"juniors\", Los Junior At\u00f3micos, including Blue Demon Jr. , La Parka Jr. and M\u00e1scara Sagrada Jr. The four defeated Charly Manson, May Flowers, Nygma and El Picudo to win the Mexican National At\u00f3micos Championship during a show in Jalisco. Five months later they lost the championship to Los Vipers (Histeria, Maniaco, Mosco de la Merced and Psicosis) at the 1999 Verano de Esc\u00e1ndalo show. After Los Junior At\u00f3micos disbanded, Aguayo began teaming regularly with H\u00e9ctor Garza, engaging in a four-way storyline feud with Heavy Metal and Latin Lover. These four competed in various tag and four-way matches throughout the lengthy feud. One of the highlights of the storyline was Heavy Metal being shaved bald after losing a combination four-way steel cage match and lucha de apuesta on the 2001 Guerra de Titanes show, when Garza pinned Heavy Metal. Later on Latin Lover would defeat Garza in another lucha de apuesta. Aguayo Jr. and Garza defeated Los Vipers (Abismo Negro and Electroshock) to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship. The duo held the title for 61 days before losing it to Pirata Morgan and El Texano. In May 2003, Aguayo Jr. moved to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). He was initially brought in as a t\u00e9cnico to team with Negro Casas against Los Guerreros del Infierno, but did not receive the expected positive reactions from the crowd, and CMLL decided to turn him heel by having him win a tournament for a shot at Atlantis' Michinoku Pro Wrestling Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship. He won the tournament over established popular heels like Dr. Wagner Jr. and Rey Bucanero, so by the time he met the babyface Atlantis for the title, he was seen as a heel by the fans. The title challenge was unsuccessful, but Aguayo was quickly put into a program with Los Capos with the story being he was getting revenge on Universo 2000 for ending his father's career. During this feud, Shocker's popular Los Guapos group backed Aguayo Jr. and he became a face again. The feud continued through the winter and into 2004 and was ended when Aguayo and El Terrible (a member of Los Guapos) defeated Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 in a double hair vs. hair match at the 2004 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas: El Santo y Salvador Lutteroth show. In the spring, Aguayo Jr. once again backed up Negro Casas and Shocker in their feud with Pierroth Jr. , Vampiro Canadiense and Tarzan Boy. The two groups went at it in trios, singles, and tag matches before they were put in the annual \"Cage of Death\" match, in which the last two men in the cage, regardless of which team they are on, would face each other in a hair vs. hair match. The heel trio escaped early and Shocker made a quick exit as well. Aguayo Jr. and Casas then faced each other, and Aguayo Jr. pinned Casas, winning his hair. Tensions began to rise between Casas and Aguayo Jr. after that point, and when H\u00e9ctor Garza jumped to CMLL in July, Aguayo Jr. ditched Casas and joined him. After turning heel again, he took part in the Leyenda de Plata tournament, held in honor of El Santo. After securing his place in the semifinals, Aguayo Jr. interfered in Negro Casas' match with Atlantis, costing Casas the bout and allowing Atlantis to advance. After defeating Atlantis in the semifinals, Aguayo Jr. faced the previous year's winner, Felino, for the trophy. After Aguayo Jr. won the match, El Hijo del Santo came to the ring to award him the trophy, but Aguayo Jr. smashed it, claiming that Santo wasn't nearly the legend that Perro Aguayo Sr. was. The angle was hot and played off the feud the original Santo and Perro Aguayo had during the 1970s. Due to El Hijo del Santo's short tour with CMLL, the feud was rushed towards an indecisive singles match. The closest thing to closure for the feud was a trios match at the CMLL 71st Anniversary Show, during which the team of Hijo del Perro Aguayo, H\u00e8ctor Garza and El Terrible (soon to be named La Furia del Norte) defeated Hijo del Santo, Negro Casas and Shocker. After that match, Santo focused more on his program with Averno and Los Guerreros del Infierno and Aguayo Jr. set his sights on Casas (to whom he lost), and the feud cooled down from there. Starting in November 2004, Aguayo Jr. restarted his feud with Los Capos by teaming frequently with Vampiro and Pierroth Jr. , who were also feuding with Los Capos at the time. At the year-end show, he had another singles match with Universo 2000 which led to Aguayo's father running in and making the save. In February 2005, Perro Aguayo Sr. returned to wrestling for one match, teaming with his son against Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 in a double hair vs. hair match. The Aguayos won the match (which was also billed as Cien Caras' retirement match), in the main event of the 2005 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. After the match, La Familia de Tijuana (Halloween, Dami\u00e1n 666), and Aguayo Jr. decided to start a new faction, Los Perros del Mal (\"The Bad Dogs\"). Soon, the group would consist of Aguayo Jr. , La Familia, La Furia del Norte, Blue Demon Jr. , Pierroth Jr. and Pierroth's storyline sons. The group took on many rivals, including Negro Casas, Felino, Heavy Metal (who had just jumped from AAA), M\u00e1scara M\u00e1gica, Universo 2000 and Aguayo's new focus, the rising star M\u00edstico, who had defeated him in a main event singles match. The two agreed to a hair vs. mask match, but no date was specified. Los Perros del Mal faced off against their rivals in the 2005 \"Cage of Death\" match, in which Dami\u00e1n 666 took the hair of M\u00e1scara M\u00e1gica. On May 5, 2006, Aguayo Jr. was defeated by Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and El Canek in a three-way match for the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in Nezahualcoyotl. Aguayo Jr. 's final major feud in CMLL was with H\u00e9ctor Garza, which culminated in a Hair vs. Hair match on March 21, 2008, at Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, which Aguayo Jr. won via a low blow. Aguayo Jr. left CMLL in October 2008, along with fellow Los Perros Del Mal members Dami\u00e1n 666 and Mr. \u00c1guila, to start his own promotion called Perros del Mal Producciones. The new promotion's debut show took place on December 7, 2008, in Mexico City. On that show, Aguayo Jr. tag-teamed with Cibern\u00e9tico and Dr. Wagner Jr. to face L. A. Park, Ol\u00edmpico and Headhunter A, and was victorious. On June 6, 2010, at Tripleman\u00eda XVIII, Aguayo returned to AAA to lead Perros del Mal in an invasion of the promotion. The group quickly aligned themselves with Konnan and Dorian Roldan's La Legi\u00f3n Extranjera, La Milicia and Los Maniacos to form La Sociedad. On August 14 at Verano de Escandalo El Hijo del Perro Aguayo wrestled his first major match for AAA since his return, when he, L. A. Park and Dami\u00e1n 666 defeated El Mes\u00edas, Cibern\u00e9tico and La Parka in a six-man tag team match, when Perro pinned Mes\u00edas. On October 1 at H\u00e9roes Inmortales IV El Mes\u00edas defeated Perro in a singles match. Afterwards, Aguayo injured his knee, sidelining him for the rest of the year. However, he made a surprise appearance on December 5, 2010 during the main event of Guerra de Titanes, helping Dami\u00e1n 666, Halloween and X-Fly hand Los Psycho Circus their first-ever loss in a steel cage weapons match. On March 18, 2011, at Rey de Reyes, Aguayo Jr. joined Dami\u00e1n 666, Halloween and Super Crazy in a winning effort against Potencia Mundial (Dr. Wagner Jr. and Los Psycho Circus); Aguayo Jr. pinned Wagner with La Lanza, following a chair shot. On April 8, 2011. Aguayo Jr. underwent emergency surgery to remove a golf ball-sized tumor from his stomach. During the surgery, a peptic ulcer burst, and he was placed in an intensive care unit at the hospital in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Aguayo Jr. was released from the hospital on April 19 and was scheduled to receive treatment for his condition for a full year. Aguayo's tumor was found to be benign; Aguayo made his return to AAA, in a non\u2013wrestling role, on May 1 and returned to the ring on May 8 in a six-man tag team match pitting Los Perros del Mal against Los Psycho Circus; Aguayo pinned Psycho Clown after a low blow. The feud continued on May 29 at Perros del Mal Producciones' third anniversary show, when Los Psycho Circus defeated Los Perros del Mal in a six-man tag team steel cage mask vs. hair match. As a result, Super Crazy, the last man left in the cage, was shaved bald. Aguayo Jr. was set to wrestle as part of Los Perros del Mal at Tripleman\u00eda XIX, facing Los Psycho Circus to determine the first-ever AAA World Trios Champions, but was forced to pull out of the event due to an adverse reaction to the medication given to him as part of his tumor treatment. Aguayo returned on July 24 at a Perros del Mal event, teaming with Dami\u00e1n 666 and Halloween against Blue Demon Jr. , Cassandro and L. A. Park; the match ended in a no contest when Park turned on his partners. Aguayo Jr. next returned to AAA on August 19, replacing L. A. Park and teaming with Dami\u00e1n 666 and Halloween against El Mes\u00edas, Joe L\u00edder and El Zorro in a six-man tag team match, which they lost via disqualification when L\u00edder was attacked by his former tag team partner Nicho el Millonario. After the match, Aguayo officially named Nicho the newest member of Los Perros del Mal. Aguayo Jr. returned to pay-per-view on October 9, 2011 at H\u00e9roes Inmortales, unsuccessfully challenging Dr. Wagner Jr. for the AAA Latin American Championship in a bullterrier match. Afterward, Aguayo Jr. began a feud with Jack Evans. On December 16, 2011 at Guerra de Titanes, Aguayo and Evans continued their rivalry in a six-man tag team match, during which they busted each other open. The match was won when Aguayo Jr. 's teammate H\u00e9ctor Garza pinned F\u00e9nix. The feud between Aguayo Jr. and Evans continued through to Rey de Reyes on March 18, 2012, when Aguayo Jr. pinned Evans to win the Rey de Reyes tournament and earn a chance to contend for the AAA Mega Championship. On August 5 at Tripleman\u00eda XX, Aguayo Jr. unsuccessfully challenged El Mes\u00edas for the AAA Mega Championship. Afterwards, Aguayo Jr. started a year-long rivalry with Cibern\u00e9tico, which culminated in a lucha de apuesta in the main event of Tripleman\u00eda XXI on June 16, 2013. Aguayo Jr. was victorious, forcing Cibern\u00e9tico to have his head shaved bald. In August 2013, Aguayo teamed with Cibern\u00e9tico against his former stable, La Secta. On October 18 at H\u00e9roes Inmortales VII, La Secta eliminated Aguayo Jr. , Cibern\u00e9tico, and El Mes\u00edas from the Copa Antonio Pe\u00f1a, which led to the three retaliating by costing Secta members Dark Escoria and Dark Espiritu their match for the AAA World Tag Team Championship. Aguayo Jr. 's tecnico turn was completed on November 22, when Los Perros del Mal members Daga and Psicosis turned on him, labeling him a traitor for teaming with Cibern\u00e9tico. However, on December 8 at Guerra de Titanes, Aguayo Jr. turned on Cibern\u00e9tico, rejoined Daga and Psicosis and brought Los Perros del Mal back under the umbrella of the reformed La Sociedad. On August 17, 2014, at Tripleman\u00eda XXII, Aguayo Jr. started a new feud with the debuting El Patr\u00f3n by attacking him and his father Dos Caras at the start of the show. Later that night in the main event, Aguayo Jr. defeated Cibern\u00e9tico, Dr. Wagner Jr. and Myzteziz, in a four-way elimination match to win Copa Tripleman\u00eda XXII. After the match, Aguayo Jr. was immediately attacked by El Patr\u00f3n. Subsequently, Aguayo Jr. and El Texano Jr. defeated El Patr\u00f3n and El Mes\u00edas at H\u00e9roes Inmortales VIII. In subsequent months, Aguayo Jr. focused on Myzteziz, and resuming the storyline that started in CMLL when Myzteziz was known as M\u00edstico, by issuing a challenge for a mask vs. hair match at Tripleman\u00eda XXIII. The story led to the main event of the 2015 Rey de Reyes, in which Aguayo Jr. teamed up with Pentag\u00f3n Jr. , only to lose to Myzteziz and the returning Rey Mysterio Jr. . On March 20, 2015, Aguayo wrestled a tag team match, teaming with Manik against Rey Mysterio Jr. and Xtreme Tiger at a show for The Crash promotion in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. During the match, Mysterio used a headscissors takedown to propel Aguayo out of the ring, but Aguayo returned to the ring, upon which Mysterio dropkicked Aguayo in the back/shoulder to set up for Mysterio's signature 619 as Aguayo landed on the middle rope (the proper position for the 619). Manik then fell onto the middle rope beside Aguayo\u2014when Aguayo appeared to be limp and unconscious, Manik shook him slightly to revive him. Mysterio performed the 619, but did not hit either opponent. While the match continued, Konnan, who was at ringside, then attempted to revive the seemingly unconscious Aguayo by shaking him. The match still continued, with Mysterio next checking on the unmoving Aguayo, bringing it to the referee's attention. The match continued, with Mysterio pinning Manik at the center of the ring while Konnan again attempted to revive Aguayo. With the match over, various personnel went to Aguayo, believing he was just unconscious and in need of medical help. Officials later brought Aguayo out of the ring. When paramedics arrived, Aguayo was brought to the local Del Prado hospital, where he was pronounced dead around 1:00am on March 21. Aguayo was 35 years old. According to the initial statement by the hospital, Aguayo died from a cervical spine trauma, reportedly as a result of the dropkick by Mysterio Jr. that propelled him forward to the ring ropes, causing severe whiplash trauma that snapped his neck. The cause of death was later determined as cardiac arrest, due to a cervical stroke caused by three fractured vertebrae. Autopsy results showed that Aguayo Jr. broke his C1, C2, and C3 vertebrae. The coroner stated that the fractures took place at two different moments of impact and that Aguayo died almost instantly. Aguayo Jr. was not immediately attended to by a physician and was actually taken from the ring on a piece of plywood instead of a stretcher, which led to some criticism of the event organizers. However, the coroner stated that it made no difference. The Tijuana wrestling commission later explained that the doctor was backstage, attending to two other injuries that happened during the show. One of those injuries was a spinal injury and they did not want to remove that wrestler from the stretcher he was on, which was why they used the plywood to move Aguayo from the ring. The doctors worked on resuscitating Aguayo for over an hour before declaring him dead. On March 21, the attorney general for Baja California conducted an investigation into Aguayo's death but no criminal charges were filed. Aguayo Jr. was buried in Guadalajara on March 23 with Konnan and Rey Mysterio Jr. serving as pallbearers. After his death, the Comisi\u00f3n de Deporte del Senado del M\u00e9xico (The Commission of Sport of the Mexican Senate) presented the initiative \"Ley para la Seguridad del Deporte en el Pa\u00eds\" (Law for the Safety of Sport in the Country\"). Many promotions, including AAA, CMLL, The Crash, Lucha Underground and World Wrestling League (WWL), paid tribute to Aguayo Jr. following his death.

He had been described as \"the best Black playwright to emerge from his generation, and as having given \"Caribbeans a real voice in Britain\". He was the first black British playwright commissioned to write a television drama series \u2014 Empire Road, which the BBC aired from 1978 to 1979. Born in Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana), the son of Neville John (a doctor) and Elaine Abbensetts, Michael Abbensetts attended Queen's College from 1952 to 1956, then Stanstead College, Quebec, Canada, and Sir George Williams University, in Montreal (1960\u201361), before moving to England \"around 1963\". He became a British citizen in 1974. Abbensetts began his writing career with short stories, but decided to turn to playwriting after seeing a performance of John Osborne's Look Back in Anger. Abbensetts was further inspired when he went to England and visited the Royal Court Theatre, Britain's premier theatre of new writing, where he was soon to become resident dramatist. Sweet Talk, Abbensetts' first play, was performed there in 1973, with a cast including Mona Hammond and Don Warrington, directed by Stephen Frears. In the same year, The Museum Attendant, his first television play, was broadcast on BBC2. Directed by Stephen Frears, the drama was, Abbensetts said, based on his own early experiences as a security guard at the Tower of London. Black Christmas, also directed by Frears, was broadcast by BBC Television in 1977 and featured Carmen Munroe and Norman Beaton. It has been called by Stephen Bourne \"one of the best television dramas of the 1970s\". During the 1970s and 1980s, a number of Abbensetts' plays were produced for the London theatre, including in the West End. Alterations appeared in 1978, followed by Samba (1980), In The Mood (1981), Outlaw (1983), Eldorado (1983) and The Lion (1993). Inner City Blues, Crime and Passion, Roadrunner and Fallen Angel were produced on television. Abbensetts' success led to his participation in what came to be considered British television's first Black soap opera, Empire Road (BBC, 1978\u201379), for which he wrote two series. He has said: \"I never really liked it being called a Soap. It was The Daily Mail that called it that. I always thought of it as a drama series, where each episode had a separate story. \" The second series was directed by Horace Ov\u00e9, \"establishing a production unit with a Black director, Black writer and Black actors. \" The cast featured Norman Beaton, Corinne Skinner-Carter, Joseph Marcell, Rudolph Walker and Wayne Laryea. Abbensetts' television work continued with Easy Money (1981) and Big George Is Dead (Channel 4, 1987) starring Norman Beaton, Linzi Drew and Ram John Holder, and the mini-series Little Napoleons (1994, Channel 4).

According to some former members of Polisario now aligned with Morocco, Abdelaziz was \"chosen\" by Algeria at the top of the organization although he did not belong to the very closed circle of the organization's founders and \"he always considered himself to be their man. \" Under Abdelaziz, Polisario continued its guerrilla war against Morocco and Mauritania, until the latter's withdrawal in 1979 and the construction of the Moroccan Wall in 1980s. With the wall limiting attacks, Abdelaziz turned to diplomatic measures to secure SADR's future. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) seated Western Sahara for the first time in 1982, despite Morocco's vehement objections. This led to Morocco's withdrawal from the OAU two years later. In 1985, Abdelaziz was elected as Vice-President of the OAU at its 21st summit, effectively signalling that the Sahrawi Republic would be a permanent OAU member despite the controversy. When the African Union (AU) replaced the OAU in 2001, Abdelaziz was elected as AU vice-president at its first summit. In December 2005, as leader of the Polisario Front, he received Spanish Human Rights Association's \"Human Rights International Prize\". Abdelaziz died of lung cancer on 31 May 2016. Abdelaziz was considered a secular nationalist and steered the Polisario and the Sahrawi republic towards political compromise, notably in backing the United Nations' Baker Plan in 2003. There was some criticism against Abdelaziz from within the Polisario for preventing reforms inside the movement, and for insisting on a diplomatic course which had gained few concessions from Morocco, rather than re-launching the armed struggle favored by many within the movement. The only supposedly opposition group is the Front Polisario Khat al-Shahid, which states that it wants to continue with militant attacks. Abdelaziz specifically denied the existence of such a group; he maintained that only the Polisario exists in the camps. Abdelaziz condemned terrorism, insisting the Polisario's guerrilla war is to be a \"clean struggle\" (that is, not targeting private citizens' safety or property); he however acknowledged mistreatment to Moroccan prisoners of war as well as attacking civilian populations in Moroccan cities by the Polisario Front, justifying this as necessary evils in times of war and that the Polisario had to use every means in order to defend the Sahrawi population from the enemy.

Later active professionally in the field of education, she assisted with the creation of the Alaska Native Language Center, and, as a statewide administrator at the University of Alaska, in 1976, led the establishment of community colleges in underserved parts of the state. Abraham was born in Yakutat, Alaska in 1929. Tlingit was her first language, and her Tlingit name was Chuu Shah. She was the daughter of Teikweidi, one of the last traditional clan leaders of the village, and his wife Susie Bremner, granddaughter of John James Bremner, a Scottish prospector and guide, who helped the U. S. Army explore the Copper River area in the 1880s. Elaine Abraham learned English at the village school, and attended a boarding school, the Sheldon Jackson High School/College, in Sitka, Alaska, also historically within Tlingit territory, on Baranof Island. She studied at the Sage Memorial School of Nursing, in Granado, Arizona, graduating at the top of her class, in 1952, and went on to work for two years as a nurse on Navajo reservations in Arizona. She then returned to Alaska, and served in hospitals in Juneau, Sitka (at the Mount Edgecumbe School), and Bethel, at a time when diphtheria and tuberculosis were predominant health threats in those areas. She played a leading role in the opening of the Alaska Native Health Services Hospital in Anchorage in 1954. In the early 1960s, she worked together with Dr. James Justice at Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital, in Sitka, in organizing the Southeast Health Aide Program, to meet the healthcare needs of Alaskan Natives living in remote villages; that program became the model for the statewide Alaska Native Health Aide Program. In the early 1970s, after retiring from nursing, Abraham pursued a bachelor's degree in human resources development, as well as a masters in \"Teaching in Multi-Ethnic Education,\" both at Alaska Pacific University, in Anchorage. Subsequently she served in administrative posts at Sheldon Jackson College, in Sitka, beginning as associate dean of students, then becoming director of special services, and, finally, vice president for institutional development. While at Sheldon Jackson she initiated the Tlingit and Haida Language Teachers Training Program, and contributed to the writing of the Alaska Legislation for Bilingual Education. In 1976 Abraham joined the University of Alaska system as vice president of the newly created Division of Rural Educational Affairs, based in Anchorage, becoming the first woman and the first Native American to hold a senior statewide administrative position at the university. During her brief tenure (the position was eliminated shortly later in an institutional reorganization), she expanded educational opportunities by supporting the establishment of new community college campuses in rural parts of the state. The following year she moved to Anchorage Community College (at the time a separate institution; as of 1987 part of the University of Alaska system), where she founded and helped develop the Native Student Services over a period of 17 years. As an administrator she arranged the first in-depth survey of Native students, in 1983, gathering insights to improve services for them; and established the position of Native Student Coordinator, as a channel for continued student input. Under Abraham the NSS fostered collaboration and mutual support among Native students, and also developed closer ties with the Native community in Anchorage. Abraham later chaired the Board of Commissioners of the Alaska Native Science Commission, a non-profit organization founded in 1993 to support relationships between research scientists and Alaskan Native communities. 1973: American Indian Achievement Award, given by the Indian Council Fire, of Chicago 1974: Title of \"Distinguished Alaskan,\" conferred by the Alaska State Legislature 2011: Inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame "}, {"text": "Kjell Albin Abrahamson (23 June 1945 \u2013 22 September 2016) was a Swedish journalist and author.

Colonel Abrams (his real name) was born in Detroit, Michigan. His family later moved to East 13 Street, in Manhattan's East Village. From an early age, Abrams began playing the guitar and piano. He was in several early bands; among them Heavy Impact - in which he played both guitar and keyboards alongside Joe Wells (guitar), Lemar Washington (guitar), Marston \"Buffy\" Freeman (bass guitar), Ronald Simmons (drums), Harry Jones (trumpet), and Barbara Mills (saxophone). In 1976, he formed Conservative Manor, 94 East (the band featuring Prince on lead guitar). He became popular on the New York underground scene via radio and club play, and had his first major hit in 1984 with \"Music Is the Answer\", on the independent label Streetwise. Other hits in the mid 1980s included \"Leave the Message Behind the Door\", \"Trapped\" (a top ten hit in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the UK), \"The Truth\", \"Speculation\", \"I'm Not Gonna Let You\", and \"Over and Over\", establishing Abrams as a solo artist, initially in Europe and later in the US. In 1985, he signed to Steven Machat's label and production company, AMI. Machat, who was collaborating and working with a British producer, Richard James Burgess, hired Burgess to produce Abrams' self-titled debut album. Machat then arranged for MCA Records to sign Abrams for worldwide releases. Burgess produced the songs \"Trapped\", \"I'm Not Gonna Let You\", and \"Table for Two\". \"Trapped\" reached the top five in the UK Singles Chart and topped the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1985, followed by his self-titled album, which spent two weeks at number one the following year. An electronic remix of \"Trapped\" was later released in 1995 by Boards of Canada, under the pseudonym Hell Interface. A new version of \"Trapped\" (\"Trapped 2006\") was released in the UK. \"I'm Not Gonna Let\" also spent a week at number one in the dance chart, in 1986. The album peaked at number 75 on the US Billboard Top 200 and Number 13 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Although Abrams had no American pop hits during his career, he had a number of entries on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart in the 1980s and 1990s, including four entries that hit number one.

He was recruited from the Abdulrahman Ghaafiqi School, where he had started acting in the seventh grade. All the filming took place in the Ancient City of Aleppo. He joined his first street protests when he was eight, alongside his elder brother Assad. His brother joined the Free Syrian Army while Qusai took a first-aid course at the Jerusalem hospital. His acting career included video tours lamenting the state of ruined Aleppo, and school plays in which he played a rebel soldier in full fighting gear. He played patriarch Abu Abdou in the situation comedy Umm Abdou the Aleppan, which aired on Syrian opposition channel Halab Today TV and on YouTube. The show's cast was composed entirely of children who played adult characters, and was produced in Aleppo during the Syrian civil war, dealing with life in Aleppo during wartime. Abtini played the husband of the titular character, Umm Abdou, who was played by his friend Rasha.

Known for his command capabilities and popular among his subordinates, Abu Jandal was called \"The Lion\" among ISIL fighters and fought in several battles in Syria and Iraq. By late 2016, Abu Jandal had become ISIL's second highest-ranking commander in Syria and led the defense of its de facto capital Raqqa against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). He was killed by a US airstrike on 26 December 2016. Generally, relatively little is known about Abu Jandal. His birth name has been reported as either \"Abdul Mohsen al-Zaghilani al-Taresh\" or \"Abdul Mohsen Al-Dhufairi\". He was born in the city of al Jahra in Kuwait, likely during the 1970s or 1980s, and was at some point influenced and radicalised by Jihadist ideology. As result, he ventured to Syria, where he joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Over time, he began to play an important role in recruiting new members for ISIL through social media, appearing in propaganda videos and carrying out executions. He was even appointed to a senior position on the ISIL Media Council. In this way, he won considerable fame and many fans and followers in his home city Al Jahra. Sometime after joining ISIL, he married the Syrian Jihadist Rahaf Zina, though other reports stated that his wife was Iraqi. The couple eventually had a son, Jandal, whereupon he adopted his kunya Abu Jandal al-Kuwaiti (\"Father of Jandal, the Kuwaiti\") as nom de guerre. He also rose in ranks as military commander, while becoming popular among subordinate ISIL fighters due to his reported modesty. By July 2014, Abu Jandal served as a top commander of the Islamic State's 6,000-man-strong Army of Hasakah, personally leading the Knights Battalion. Over time, he became a \"troubleshooter\" for ISIL, and the battalion under his command subsequently became known the \"Rapid Response Battalion\". In August 2014, Abu Jandal helped to brutally suppress the Al-Shaitat tribal rebellion, and around September of that year, he fought in Deir ez-Zor. Between 2015 and 2016, Abu Jandal led various military operations in both Iraq as well as Syria, and joined ISIL's War Committee. In this capacity, he was involved in the planning and operation of suicide car bombs, IEDs, and chemical weapons against the SDF, and became closely associated with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as well as ISIL's terror attack planners. By December 2016, Abu Jandal had risen to the second-most important ISIL commander in Syria, and participated in an offensive to retake Palmyra and its surroundings from the Syrian government. After this attack's success on 11 December, he was redeployed to Raqqa and appointed as chief commander for the defenses of the Islamic State's de facto capital in face of the SDF-led Raqqa campaign. His most important task was protecting ISIL's supply routes to the northern frontlines and al-Bab in the west. Abu Jandal consequently became crucially involved in the battle for the strategic significant village of Jabar. ISIL troops who were probably under his command achieved a minor success during this battle when they surrounded and destroyed a SDF detachment in the village on 21 December, forcing the international SDF volunteer Ryan Lock to kill himself in order to not be captured. Nevertheless, Jabar finally fell to the SDF on 26 December, whereupon Abu Jandal personally organized and led a large-scale counter-attack. In course of this assault, a US airstrike hit his convoy near the village, killing him and his bodyguards; the counter-attack subsequently failed. Abu Jandal was in his thirties when he died. According to CJTF\u2013OIR, Abu Jandal's death was a heavy blow to ISIL, degrading \"ISIL's ability to defend Raqqa and launch external operations against the West. \" ISIL confirmed his death on 27 December and eulogized him in a video titled \"Smashing the Enemies: Regarding the Results of the Army of the Islamic State Against the Apostate PKK on the Outskirts of the Wilayat [al-Raqqa]\". After his death, his widow Rahaf Zina reportedly married Hussein Al-Dhufairi, who is possibly Abu Jandal's brother and another ISIL leader. On March 25, 2017, Hussein Al-Dhufairi and Rahaf Zina were arrested by security forces in Manila, Philippines. Soon after, Kuwaiti security officials executed two raids in Kuwait, arresting three additional family members of Abu Jandal, and seven other suspects. Kuwaiti officials said they found bomb-making equipment during the raids. "}, {"text": "Ahmad Abu Matar (1944 - 2016) was a Palestinian academic and writer who often wrote on human rights issues.

He was founder and president of the Achenbaum Institute of Marketing. Achenbaum was born to a Jewish family in 1925 in Bronx County, New York, the son of a dressmaker. He attended Taft High School and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in Business Economics from the University of California, Los Angeles and a master's degree in Business Economics from Columbia University. After school, he served as a Corporal in the Army Air Corps during World War II. From 1951 to 1974, Achenbaum held senior executive positions at four major advertising agencies in New York City: McCann Erickson, J. Walter Thompson, Grey Advertising, and Ted Bates, where he served as vice chairman, overseeing all professional services. Achenbaum served as chairman at a series of marketing management consultancies for 40 years, including Canter, Achenbaum and Associates, which he co-founded with longtime colleague Stanley Canter in 1974, and Achenbaum, Bogda Associates, which he formed with Pete Bogda in 1993. Some of these firms' clients included Procter and Gamble, GE, Nestle, Kraft, Honda, and the United States Department of Defense. Achenbaum regularly spoke out about emerging trends and the future of advertising and marketing, challenging many of the accepted business practices of the day. He wrote weekly columns for Ad Age and Marketing Week in the 1980s. He generated considerable controversy by challenging the nature of the relationship between advertising agencies and their clients. His consulting work contributed to major changes in both the advertising agency selection process and the development of negotiated agency compensation agreements. In addition to his work as a practitioner, Achenbaum was an adjunct professor of marketing at the Baruch College of the City University of New York. He also guest lectured at numerous universities, including New York University, Columbia University, and McGill. He was a member of the editorial board of many key professional organizations, including the Market Research Council and the American Marketing Association. Achenbaum is also the author of Lessons Learned: A Practitioner's Guide to Successful Marketing. In 2005, Achenbaum retired from management consulting and turned his efforts toward preparing aspiring marketing professionals and scholars. He founded the Achenbaum Institute of Marketing. In 2012, the Institute donated Achenbaum's professional papers (research studies, presentations, articles, correspondence and speeches) to The John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising & Marketing History at Duke University Libraries. The Hartman Center praised the collection as \"one of the rare collections which covers the breadth of a person\u2019s career, while also documenting the internal workings of a number of agencies and consulting firms. \" The papers comprise over 80,000 items and contain approximately 100 linear feet of material, documenting over fifty years of Achenbaum's professional life. In 2013, the Achenbaum Institute of Marketing established the Alvin A. Achenbaum Travel Grant Program, which sponsors travel for scholars of marketing, research and advertising to study at the Hartman Center. In 2013, the Institute published Lessons Learned: A Practitioner\u2019s Guide to Successful Marketing, an instructional guide for students and marketers based on the business lessons Achenbaum learned during his long career. In 1987, Achenbaum was elected to the Market Research Hall of Fame. In 2000, he was named one of the most influential advertising people of the 20th century by Advertising Age. Achenbaum has been married twice. In 1984, he married Barbara, a schoolteacher at Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, New York; they had three children, Jon Achenbaum, Lisa Achenbaum Kounitz and Martha Achenbaum Bratt. His second wife was Montreal-born Leila Auerbach Goldberg Lebendig who had four children from a previous marriage. He died on January 26, 2016; services were held at Riverside Memorial Chapel.

She was a part of the University of Oregon faculty starting in 1967. Acker is considered one of the leading analysts regarding gender and class within the second wave of feminism. Acker was born in Illinois in 1924. She received her bachelors from Hunter College, her master's from the University of Chicago, and her Ph. D. from the University of Oregon. Acker is best known for her theories on the relationship between race, class, and gender. She discusses this relationship in several of her publications, including her 2006 book Class Questions: Feminist Answers. Acker describes the need to think about race, class, and gender not as separate entities but as \"intersecting systems of oppression. In 1973, Acker founded the Center for the Study of Women in Society at the University of Oregon. She successfully helped to raise pay wages for low-wage jobs in Oregon while serving on a state task force from 1981-1983.

Ackermann (1946 \u2013 December 24, 2016) was a Swiss-born American psychologist who explored the interactions between developmental psychology, play, learning and design. A graduate of the University of Geneva, and a protoge to Jean Piaget, she held permanent and visiting positions at several institutions in the United States and Europe, including the MIT Media Lab. Ackermann was born in Switzerland in 1946. When she was a small child, Ackermann moved with her family to the hills outside of Cannes. Her mother Edith and her stepfather Klaus Peter Wieland both worked as magazine correspondents; Klaus Peter's father was painter Hans Beat Wieland. She attended the University of Geneva for an undergraduate degree, a master's degree and a Ph. D. in developmental psychology. Soon after graduating, she was a junior faculty member in psychology at the University of Geneva and a research associate of Jean Piaget at the Centre International d'Epist\u00e9mologie G\u00e9n\u00e9tique. Ackermann's career focused on developmental psychology, play and the influence of technology on childhood learning. She worked for the MIT Media Lab with constructionism expert Seymour Papert. Using Papert's Logo programming language, Ackermann and Papert did work for The Lego Group that led to the development of Lego Mindstorms. She was also a visiting scientist at the MIT School of Architecture, was Honorary Professor of Psychology the University of Aix-Marseille I, and was a visiting professor at the University of Siena in Italy. In addition, she worked closely with the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Ackermann was an Osher Fellow at the Exploratorium. Ackermann conducted early research that attempted to reconcile Piagetian principles with situated learning. Reanalyzing Piaget's work with the water-level task in terms of how children move from concrete thinking to abstraction, Ackermann wrote that Piaget's theory deals with how children become detached from concrete objects, where other theorists focused on the children's attachment to concrete items. In other work with Marina Bers, Ackermann studied hospitalized pediatric heart patients and found that they benefited from an interactive storytelling environment. Ever contributing to the development of others, Edith coauthored guides for parents to aid in the development of their children with funding from LEGO at the dawn of the new millennium. She also mentored numerous students by reading and sharing reflections on their works with them. She also advised design and R&D firms, INVIVIA and bespoke R&D. Late in life, Ackermann became a close companion of Swiss philosopher Ernst von Glasersfeld; the pair met many years earlier while working with Piaget. In 2008, he moved to Massachusetts, and they began meeting frequently and working on an essay that remained unfinished upon his death in 2010. In late 2016, Ackermann received a lifetime achievement award at the FabLearn Conference at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. "}, {"text": "Robert D. Acland, MBBS, FRCS (June 20, 1941 \u2013 January 6, 2016) was a surgeon and academic credited with being one of the pioneers in plastic and reconstructive microsurgery. He was the younger son of Richard Acland and his wife Anne. He developed one of the first microsurgical instruments, the Acland micro-vessel clamp, as well as the 10-0 nylon sutures and needles that are still used today. He published the first edition of Acland's Practice Manual for Micro-vascular Surgery, also known as the \"Red Book\", a manual on microsurgical techniques (1997). The current edition was revised in 2008 and is still an essential tool for any trainee in microsurgical techniques and fundamentals of surgical microscopes and their use. Acland was also a clinical anatomist and became a pioneer in the field of fresh tissue dissection. From 1981 to 2011, he established and ran the Fresh Tissue Anatomy Dissection Laboratory for surgeons and students at the University of Louisville, which was the first of its kind in the United States, and is considered one of the best and most respected facilities in the world. Acland's major published work consists of the comprehensive Video Atlas of Human Anatomy. The video atlas depicts moving structures and pioneers new and highly effective techniques of anatomical videography for a clear three-dimensional understanding of spatial relationships. The unique dynamic and 3-D perspective was achieved using innovative camera rotation techniques pioneered at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. Robert Acland was born on June 20, 1941, in Exeter, England, to Richard Thomas Dyke Acland, the 15th baronet of Columb John, and Anne Alford. Although Richard Acland was a member of the landed gentry, he held left-wing political views; he was a Labour member of Parliament (MP) and one of the founders of the far-left Common Wealth Party, which promoted common ownership of land. In 1944 Richard Acland donated the ancestral estate of Killerton to the National Trust. Owned by the Aclands since the 17th century, Killerton consisted of a manor house and several thousand acres near Exeter. As they would not be able to rely on Killerton for financial support, Richard Acland told his sons that they would have to \"make it on their own by being better, not by heredity. \"Robert Acland grew up in the dower house at Killerton instead of the main manor house. He went to the village school and then to Bryanston School in Dorset, where he said he developed \"a great interest in breaking rules. \" He had the opportunity to learn carpentry and welding at Bryanston, practical skills that he would later put to use as a surgeon. Acland started at London Hospital Medical College (now Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry) in 1959. After graduating in 1964, he did an internship at Bukumbi Hospital in Tanzania, where he built a Thomas splint (fraction splint) for a boy mauled by a lion. This experience heightened his interest in surgery and made him feel like he could use his hands to help people. Acland continued his medical training as a senior house officer (SHO) in Northampton, Mansfield and then took a SHO post in Oxford. In 1969 Acland spent a year as a senior registrar in general surgery in Swindon, where his interest in microsurgery began after watching John Cobett perform a microvascular anastomosis. Acland was fascinated by the utmost surgical skill microsurgery required, and thought that the instrumentation then available was crude and could be improved upon. During his training in Swindon he began developing microsurgical instruments on the side but realized that to make any real progress he would need to research the problem full-time. Acland applied for and received two years of funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to improve the instruments used in microsurgery. It was unusual for surgical trainees to receive MRC funding, and Acland suspected that the Scottish plastic surgeon Thomas Gibson may have played a part in approving his application. With this funding he returned to London Hospital in 1970, where he improved the tiny needles and thread used in microsurgery, invented the \"Acland micro vessel clamp,\" and investigated how to prevent microthrombosis. He developed smaller needles and thread for microsurgery, making them himself. Acland realized that he needed to commercialize the process and initially approached Ethicon, then the largest suture manufacturer in Britain, with a proposal to do so. They thought microsurgery sutures would not sell well and turned him down. Acland then turned to Springler and Tritt, a startup suture company in southern Germany. Acland then trained as a registrar in plastic surgery at Canniesburn Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, from 1972 to 1975. While at Canniesburn Hospital, Acland performed meticulous microsurgery operations that could last up to 14 hours. The medical establishment at the NHS was displeased with him taking up so much time in the operating room, and he came to see that the NHS was not the place for his perfectionism. In 1975 he accepted an offer to set up a microsurgery teaching laboratory at the Kleinert-Kutz Hand Center in Louisville, Kentucky. The center had been founded by Harold E. Kleinert, a pioneering surgeon who was the first to use microsurgery to treat hand injuries, and his partner and fellow hand surgeon Joseph E. Kutz. Kleinert had also established the Christine M. Kleinert Fellowship in Hand Surgery in 1960 to give surgical residents more experience with hand surgery. He realized that the fellowship needed to improve its teaching of microsurgery, and invited Acland to set up a teaching laboratory at the suggestion of Graham Lister, a plastic surgeon who had joined Kleinert's practice and who had trained with Acland at Canniesburn Hospital. Acland played a key role in the founding of the University of Louisville\u2019s fresh tissue dissection laboratory in 1981. A retired surgeon, Herbert Wald, asked Acland and two other surgeons, Harold Kleinert and Gordon Tobin, to help pay for a large walk-in refrigerator for unembalmed cadaver preservation. While it was immediately useful, Tobin thought that it resembled a dungeon cell, located as it was in the basement of a University of Louisville medical building. Acland was appointed director of the fresh tissue laboratory in 1983 upon Dr. Wald's full retirement, and under his leadership the laboratory was substantially expanded and improved. As director, Acland began to transition away from teaching microsurgery in favor of teaching anatomy. Acland began making a video atlas of anatomy in the fall of 1993. Although he had been considering such a project for years, the immediate cause was a conversation he had with a medical student, Suzanne l'Ecuyer, at the University of Louisville, after giving a lecture on the importance of anatomy in clinical practice. His goal in producing the video atlas was to dissect lightly embalmed cadavers in order to preserve natural tissue appearance and demonstrate structures moving as they would in the living body. He also wanted to help students understand three-dimensional anatomical relationships by rotating the camera around specimens. Acland considered the project to be his personal \"Sistine Chapel\". Acland was married three times and had four children. He married his first wife, Sarah Wood, in 1963. A fellow student at the London Hospital Medical College, she became a psychiatrist and accompanied him when he moved to the United States in 1975. They had two children together; Beatrice, born in 1966, and Daniel, born in 1969. He divorced Sarah in 1983 and that same year married Susan Bishop of Louisville, Kentucky. He had two children with her; Benjamin, born in 1985, and Emily, born in 1987. He divorced Susan in 1990. In 1992 he married Bette Levy, a respected local textile artist, to whom he was married until his death in 2016. According to Sarah, as of 2016 all three wives live in the Louisville area and get along well. Acland was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, or bile duct cancer, in September 2014. He died on January 6, 2016, some 16 months later. He was 74 years old when he died.

Ken Adam won two Academy Awards for Best Art Direction. Born in Berlin, he relocated to England with his Jewish family at the age of 13 soon after the Nazis came to power. Together with his younger brother Denis Adam he was one of only three German-born pilots to serve in the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War. Adam was born Klaus Hugo Adam in 1921 in Berlin to an upper-middle-class secular Jewish family, the third child of Lilli (n\u00e9e Saalfeld) and Fritz Adam, a former Prussian cavalry officer who had served with the Zieten Hussars. Fritz had been awarded the Iron Cross Second Class and the Iron Cross First Class for his service in the First World War. Fritz co-owned a well-known high-fashion clothing and sporting goods store called S. Adam (Berlin, Leipziger Stra\u00dfe/Friedrichstra\u00dfe) together with his three brothers, George, Siegfried and Otto Adam. The company had been established in 1863 by Saul Adam. Klaus (Ken) had two older siblings, Peter, Loni and a younger brother Dieter (1 February 1924 \u2013 17 October 2018). The family lived an almost idyllic, privileged existence until the Nazi Party came to power. His older brother Peter was good friends with Gottfried Reinhardt the son of theatre and film director Max Reinhardt and they would often take the young Klaus out with them. As a result, he got to know Max Reinhardt and many other people in the German theatre. Gottfried Reinhardt later became a film director and producer. The combination of his brother Dieter at the age of nine having a fight with a playground bully wearing a Hitler Youth uniform and the increasing discrimination against Jews convinced their parents to send Klaus and Dieter to Craigend Park boarding school in Edinburgh, Scotland. Upon arrival Klaus anglicised his name to Kenneth and eventually Ken while his brother Dieter changed his to Denis. Their oldest brother Peter was at the time studying law at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France and decided to move to England and complete his studies there. The rest of the Adam family stayed in Germany as Adam's father felt that the Nazis were only a temporary aberration and they would wait it out. Things however continued to deteriorate with Jewish stores being boycotted and targeted for attacks in April 1933. During the summer of 1933 Max Reich a senior employee of the family business and then Fritz Adam was arrested. Reich was the member of the SS and leader of the business's Nazi cell. Reich was eventually released and Fitz Adam was released and put under house arrest for three days. Inquiries determined that a former employee who had been dismissed for dishonesty had accused the two men of unfair dismissal and conspiring to maintain undeclared funds in Switzerland. It took two weeks to disprove both allegations and no charges were laid against either men. Now reluctantly coming the conclusion that Jews had no future in Germany, Fritz, Lilli and Loni as well as some of Ken's aunts and uncles, fled to England in the summer of 1934. The family eventually settled in the Hampstead area of London the following year. The family were declared refugees on their arrival to England and identified as \"friendly aliens\" with the exception of Denis who was too young to be classified. The family arrived in England with nothing other than some gold coins Lilli had smuggled out. His mother who had never previously worked in her life used the little money they had to establish and run a boarding house. His father struggled with his change in status and starting over in a new country. His father started an import-export business selling gloves but his health deteriorated and he died in 1936 when he was 56 years old. Adam left the boarding school in Edinburgh to rejoin his parents in London and continued his education at St. Paul's School in London. At his mother's boarding house Adam became increasingly interested in cinema after coming into contact with a number of artists among the Jewish refugees who were boarding there. He was introduced to Vincent Korda, a Hungarian art director when he was working on the film Knight Without Armour at Denham Studios. Korda not only nurtured Adam's passion for films, but encouraged him to train as an architect if he was interested in becoming a production designer. Leaving school he became an apprentice at the firm of CW Glover & Partners (which specialized in making bomb shelters) he signed up for evening classes at the Bartlett School of Architecture at the University College London. Among his tutors was a part-time teacher who had been an assistant of famed German architect Erich Mendelsohn from whom Adam learned valuable architectural drawing techniques. When World War II began Adam was working on designs for air-raid shelters and illustrated books on air-raid protection and gas-masks. As German citizens the Adam family could have been interned as enemy aliens, but Adam was able to in October 1940 to join the Pioneer Corps, a support unit of the British Army open to citizens of Axis countries resident in the UK and other Commonwealth countries, provided they were not considered a risk to security. Adam was seconded to design bomb shelters. After eight months service in the Pioneer Corps, Adam's application to join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a pilot was accepted. After initial flight training on Tiger Moth biplanes in Scotland, he was sent to Canada and the United States for additional training. Among his instructors was British actor Michael Rennie. Flight Lieutenant Adam joined No. 609 Squadron at RAF Lympne on 1 October 1943. He was nicknamed \"Heinie the tank-buster\" by his comrades for his daring exploits. The squadron flew the Hawker Typhoon, initially in support of USAAF long-range bombing missions over Europe. Later they were employed in support of ground troops, including at the battle of the Falaise Gap, in Normandy after D-Day. In 1944, his brother Denis joined No. 183 Squadron, joining Adam in No. 123 Wing. There were four squadrons in the wing, 164, 183 198 and 609. Together with his brother Denis, Adam was one of three German-born pilots to serve in the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War. The third being Peter Stevens (RAF officer) (born Georg Franz Hein). As such, if they had been captured by the Germans, they were liable to execution as a traitor, rather than being treated as a prisoner of war. Following the end of the war Adam was the Allied officer in charge of German labour rebuilding Wunsthorf airfield. Adam left the RAF upon his demobilization in 1947. Adam entered the film industry as a draughtsman on This Was a Woman (1948) at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. His first major screen credit was as production designer on the British thriller Soho Incident (1956). Working in 1952 for art director Paul Sheriff on the Burt Lancaster film The Crimson Pirate, Adam designed an 18th-century hot-air balloon, a flame-throwing tank, and a rowing boat that transformed into a submarine. In the mid-1950s, he worked (uncredited) on the epics Around the World in 80 Days (also 1956) and Ben-Hur (1959), directed by William Wyler. In 1956 he assisted art director Edward Carrere with the sets for Helen of Troy. His first major credit was for the horror film, Night of the Demon (1957), directed by Jacques Tourneur, and he was also the production designer on several films directed by Robert Aldrich. The first public knowledge of his expertise came when he won an award for the sets of The Trials of Oscar Wildeat the Moscow Film Festival in 1960. He was hired for the first James Bond film, Dr. No (1962). Adam did not work in the second James Bond film, From Russia with Love (1963) because he was working on Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove (1964). His work on this film was described by the British Film Institute (BFI) as \"gleaming and sinister. \" Steven Spielberg even called it \"the best set that's ever been designed. \" He turned down the opportunity to work on Kubrick's next project, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), after he found out that Kubrick had been working with NASA for a year on space exploration, and that would put him at a disadvantage in developing his art. This enabled Adam to make his name with his innovative, semi-futuristic sets for further James Bond films, such as Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), and Diamonds Are Forever (1971). The supertanker set for The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) was constructed in the largest sound stage in the world, at the time. It was lit by Stanley Kubrick in secret. His last Bond film was Moonraker (1979). Writing for The Guardian in 2005, journalist Johnny Dee claimed: \"His sets for the seven Bond films he worked on [. . . ] are as iconic as the movies themselves and set the benchmark for every blockbuster\". Adam's other film credits include The Trials of Oscar Wilde (1960), the Michael Caine espionage thriller The Ipcress File (1965) and its sequel Funeral in Berlin (1966), the Peter O'Toole version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969), Sleuth (1972), Salon Kitty (1976), Agnes of God (1985), Addams Family Values (1993), and The Madness of King George (1994). He was also a visual consultant on the film version of Pennies from Heaven (1981), adapted from Dennis Potter's television serial. Adam returned to work with Kubrick on Barry Lyndon (1975), for which he won his first Oscar. The BFI noted the film's \"contrastingly mellow Technicolor beauties\" in its depiction of the 18th century. He also designed the famous car for the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), which was produced by the same team as the James Bond film series. During the late 1970s, he worked on storyboards and concept art for Star Trek: Planet of the Titans, then in pre-production. The film was eventually shelved by Paramount Pictures. Adam was a jury member at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival and the 49th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1999, during the Victoria and Albert Museum exhibition \"Ken Adam \u2013 Designing the Cold War\", Adam spoke on his role in the design of film sets associated with the 1960s through the 1980s. Adam died on 10 March 2016 at his home in London, following a short illness. He was 95 years old. He met his Italian wife Maria Letizia Moauro (1930 - ) while filming on location in Ischia, and they married on 16 August 1952. In September 2012, Adam handed over his entire body of work to the Deutsche Kinemathek.

He won the Under 2-Liter class of the 1968 Trans-Am Championship and the 1969 SCCA Continental Championship. Adamowicz was born in 1941 to Polish immigrants in Moriah, New York and raised in Port Henry, New York. He began his career with the US Army and worked as a communications staffer at the White House during the late 1950s and 1960s. It was during his time in Washington DC that Adamowicz took up auto racing. He started racing with a Volvo PV 544 in neighbouring Maryland in 1963. He later contested the Under 2-Liter class of the 1968 Trans-Am Championship in a Porsche 911, then raced in the Can-Am Series and Formula A/Formula 5000, winning the 1969 SCCA Continental Championship. He had an opportunity to race in the 1970 Indianapolis 500, but during the first lap of his qualifying attempt in his Eagle-Offy the yellow light was shown and Adamowicz slowed. However, the yellow was an error and Adamowicz was ordered to continue with the other 3 laps. The first lap, 6 mph (9. 7 km/h) slower than his others, dragged down his average to a point where he was bumped from the field. He got in another car but crashed in practice before having a chance to requalify. Adamowicz returned to sports cars, racing TransAm in an Autodynamics Dodge Challenger as teammate to Sam Posey, achieving second place in the 1971 24 Hours of Daytona in a Ferrari 512S, shared with Ronnie Bucknum, and third place in the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans with Sam Posey in a 512M After the decline of the Can Am and F5000 formulas, he moved to IMSA series and won the 1979 GTU championship in an Electramotive Nissan 280ZX and 1982 GTO championship in an Electramotive 280ZX-T. He returned to prototypes in 1984 but had little success at that level and retired after the 1989 24 Hours of Daytona. He then competed in select vintage races in the same 1969-model Eagle racing car in which he won the 1969 SCCA Continental Championship. The car is now owned by Doug Magnon, the founder of the Riverside International Automotive Museum, and prepared by mechanic Bill Losee. It bears the identical livery it carried back in 1969. As the Eagle had been parked immediately after the 1969 season, and was not run again until following its restoration in 2008, Adamowicz remained the only driver to actually have driven this car. Adamowicz was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2016. Early in 2015, Adamowicz was diagnosed with brain cancer, glioblastoma. He died on October 10, 2016 at the age of 75.

The daughter of a Methodist minister, Dr. Chris G. Hohn, Doty was born in New Ulm, Minnesota. When she was 6, the family moved to Warrenton, Missouri, where her father was chaplain and executive secretary at an orphan's home. After she developed lung problems, she spent two years at a camp in Minnesota. As early as age 13, she took her father's place in the pulpit when he was sick. In a 1939 newspaper article, she recalled: \"It was quite a radical thing, in that small town, for a little girl to conduct the church services and preach the sermon, but the congregation understood and were very kind to me. \"Doty was a student at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota, (where she sang in the a cappella choir) and worked as a catalog clerk at the headquarters of Montgomery Ward when an opportunity for an acting career arose. She competed in 1939 in the national finals of the Jesse L. Lasky radio contest, Gateway to Hollywood, received a contract, and remained in California to begin a film career under the name of Kathryn Adams. Doty debuted on film in 5th Avenue Girl (1939). One of her most notable roles was as \"Mrs. Brown\", the young mother in Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur (1942). She co-starred in Sky Raiders (1941), a film serial from Universal and had the leading lady role in three Western films in which Johnny Mack Brown starred. She married fellow actor Hugh Beaumont in an Easter wedding, April 13, 1941, at Hollywood Congregational Church. They had three children: Hunter, Kristy, and Mark. After divorcing Beaumont in 1974, she married Fred Doty, and relocated to her native Minnesota. Fred Doty (1922 \u2013 2011) died on January 8, 2011, aged 88. She earned a master's degree in Educational Psychology and had a career as a psychologist, working at the Footlight's Child Guidance Clinic at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center and later in Minnesota after she moved back to her home state. While in her eighties, Adams Doty wrote two novels, both for young adult readers: A Long Year of Silence (2004) and Wild Orphan (2006). A Long Year of Silence, set in New Ulm, Minnesota, during World War I, was a finalist for the Minnesota Book Award and winner of the 2005 Midwest Book Award. A third book, Becoming the Mother of Me (2009), described her life growing up as a minister's daughter and her trip to Hollywood and her first marriage. Writing as Kathryn Doty, she published short stories in Pocket, The Friend and various children's magazines. Adams died on October 14, 2016, aged 96.

"}, {"text": "Richard George Adams (9 May 1920 \u2013 24 December 2016) was an English novelist and writer of the books Watership Down, Shardik and The Plague Dogs. He studied modern history at university before serving in the British Army during World War II. Afterwards, he completed his studies, and then joined the British Civil Service. In 1974, two years after Watership Down was published, Adams became a full-time author. Richard Adams was born on 9 May 1920 in Wash Common, near Newbury, Berkshire, England, the son of Lillian Rosa (Button) and Evelyn George Beadon Adams, a doctor. He attended Horris Hill School from 1926 to 1933, and then Bradfield College from 1933 to 1938. In 1938, he went to Worcester College, Oxford, to read Modern History. In July 1940, Adams was called up to join the British Army. He was posted to the Royal Army Service Corps and was selected for the Airborne Company, where he worked as a brigade liaison. He served in Palestine, Europe and the Far East but saw no direct action against either the Germans or the Japanese. After leaving the army in 1946, Adams returned to Worcester College to continue his studies for a further two years. He received a bachelor's degree in 1948, proceeding MA in 1953. After his graduation in 1948, Adams joined the British Civil Service, rising to the rank of Assistant Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, later part of the Department of the Environment. He began to write his own stories in his spare time, reading them to his children and later on, to his grandchildren. Adams originally began telling the story that would become Watership Down to his two daughters on a car trip. They eventually insisted that he publish it as a book. He began writing in 1966, taking two years to complete it. In 1972, after four publishers and three writers' agencies turned down the manuscript, Rex Collings agreed to publish the work. The book gained international acclaim almost immediately for reinvigorating anthropomorphic fiction with naturalism. Over the next few years Watership Down sold over a million copies worldwide. Adams won both of the most prestigious British children's book awards, one of six authors to do so: the Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize. In 1974, following publication of his second novel, Shardik, he left the Civil Service to become a full-time author. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1975. At one point, Adams served as writer-in-residence at the University of Florida and at Hollins University in Virginia. Adams was the recipient of the inaugural Whitchurch Arts Award for inspiration in January 2010, presented at the Watership Down pub in Freefolk, Hampshire. In 2015 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Winchester. In 1982, Adams served one year as president of the RSPCA. Besides campaigning against furs, Adams wrote The Plague Dogs to satirize animal experimentation (as well as government and tabloid press). He also made a voyage through the Antarctic in the company of the ornithologist Ronald Lockley. Just before his 90th birthday, he wrote a new story for a charity book, Gentle Footprints, to raise funds for the Born Free Foundation. In 1949, Adams married Elizabeth (Barbara), daughter of R. A. F. Squadron-Leader Edward Fox Dyke Acland, son of the barrister and judge Sir Reginald Brodie Dyke Acland, whose father, the scientist Henry Wentworth Dyke Acland (himself created a baronet of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford) descended from the Acland baronets of Columb John. Until his death, he lived with his wife in Whitchurch, within 10 miles (16 km) of his birthplace. Their daughters, to whom Adams originally related the tales that became Watership Down, are Juliet and Rosamond. Adams celebrated his 90th birthday in 2010 with a party at the White Hart in his hometown of Whitchurch, Hampshire, where Sir George Young presented him with a painting by a local artist. Adams wrote a poetic piece celebrating his home of the past 28 years. Adams was an Orthodox Christian. Adams died on 24 December 2016 at the age of 96 in Oxford, England from complications of a blood disorder.

He was described as the chief of its external operations. He was the second most senior leader of the Islamic State after its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Media reports in August 2016 suggested he was in charge of a special unit, known as the Emni, that was established by ISIL in 2014 with the double objective of internal policing and executing operations outside the ISIL territory. On 5 May 2015, the U. S. State Department Rewards for Justice Program announced a reward up to US$5 million for information leading to his capture. On 30 August 2016, the Islamic State announced al-Adnani has been killed in Aleppo Province. A number of fighting forces claimed responsibility for al-Adnani's death. On 12 September 2016, the U. S. Department of Defense officially confirmed that a U. S. airstrike had killed al-Adnani. Al-Adnani was born in 1977 in the town of Binnish in the countryside of Idlib Governorate, western Syria. In a biography published by ISIS cleric Turki al-Binali after Adnani's death, it's written that he \"grew up with the love of mosques . . . [and] memorized the Quran as a young man. \" According to a biography penned by Turki al-Binali, Adnani became involved in Islamic militancy in the year 2000. His primary teacher was Abu Anas al-Shami, a senior leader in Jama'at al-Tawhid wal Jihad. He swore allegiance to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi along with thirty-five others while in Syria, with a plan to fight the government of Bashar al-Assad. However, the Americans invaded Iraq, and Adnani became one of the first foreign fighters to oppose Coalition forces in Iraq. He was summoned for questioning repeatedly by the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and was arrested three times. One of the times he was arrested was when he was passing through al-Bukamal on his way to Iraq for the first time. He spent months in jail and was finally freed after he refused to divulge information, despite being tortured. Al-Adnani, alongside Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, was one of the last to evacuate the city of Fallujah after the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004. In May 2005 Al-Adnani was arrested by Coalition forces in Al Anbar Governorate in Iraq under a fake name \"Yasser Khalaf Hussein Nazal al-Rawi\", and was released in 2010. In December 2012, an Iraqi intelligence official said he was using a number of aliases including \"Abu Mohamed al-Adnani, Taha al-Banshi, Jaber Taha Falah, Abu Baker al-Khatab and Abu Sadek al-Rawi. \" Al-Adnani was highly respected by his fellow fighters throughout his time in the Iraq insurgency, with ISI leader Abu Omar al-Baghdadi saying about him, \"It will be for this man the whole affair (of jihad)\". Abu Musab al-Zarqawi trusted him so much that he allowed him to make executive decisions independently, saying \"Do not consult me on matters, just brief me. \" He was also the teacher of Manaf Abd al-Rahim al-Rawi, the Al-Qaeda in Iraq \"governor\" for Baghdad province. According to Harry Sarfo, a former German member of the group. \"The big man behind everything is Abu Muhammad al-Adnani. . . . He is the head of the Emni, and he is the head of the special forces as well. . . . Everything goes back to him. \"On 18 August 2014, the US State Department listed al-Adnani as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. On 15 August 2014, he was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council. According to a former ISIS militant, al-Adnani personally participated in the burning death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh in 2015, and directed ISIS media crews to produce videos of killings. On 4 January 2016, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani was reportedly injured by an Iraqi airstrike on Barwana, near Haditha, Iraq and was moved to Mosul for recovery. As spokesman of the Islamic State, Adnani made a considerable number of speeches. His rhetorical style received attention. Abu al-Waleed al-Salafi, a researcher, comments, \"I have analysed the speeches of Baghdadi and Adnani psychologically more than once, and I found a result: that Adnani's speech seeks to inspire zeal in the soul, while Baghdadi's speech seeks to inspire calm. \" Adnani's vitriolic speaking style established his reputation as the 'attack dog' of the Islamic State, especially for his denunciations of al-Qaeda. \"Now Now the Fighting Comes\" (January 25, 2012) \"Iraq, Iraq Oh Ahl al-Sunnah\" (February 24, 2012) \"The State of Islam Will Remain Safe\" (March 4, 2012) \"I Exhort You to One Thing Only\" (May 21, 2012) \"The Incursions Are Deadlier\" (November 1, 2012) \"The Seven Facts\" (January 30, 2013) \"So Fight Them, Verily They Are Polytheists\" (June 15, 2013) \"Ignore Them and Their False Allegations\" (June 20, 2013) \"They Will Not Harm You Except For [Some] Annoyance\" (July 30, 2013) \"Peaceful Is Whose Religion?\" (30 August 2013) \"May God Be With You, Oh the Oppressed State\" (30 September 2013) \"The Scout Doesn't Lie To His People\" (January 7, 2014) \"Then We Pray For God's Curse to Be On the Liars\" (March 7, 2014) \"He Will Surely Establish For Them [Therein] Their Religion Which He Has Preferred For Them\" (April 3, 2014) \"This is Not Our Manhaj, Nor Will It Ever Be\" (April 17, 2014) \"Sorry, Emir of Al-Qaeda\" (May 11, 2014) \"What Comes to You of Good Is From Allah\" (June 12, 2014) \"This Is the Promise of Allah\" (June 29, 2014) \"Indeed, Your Lord Is Ever Watchful\" (22 September 2014) \"Say Die in Your Rage\" (26 January 2015) \"So They Kill and Are Killed\" (12 March 2015) \"O Our People Respond to the Caller of Allah\" (23 June 2015) \"Say to Those Who Disbelieve You Will Be Overcome\" (October 15, 2015) \"And Those Who Lived [In Faith] Would Live Upon Evidence\" (21 May 2016) On 22 September 2014, al-Adnani gave a lengthy speech entitled \"Indeed, Your Lord Is Ever Watchful\", which was significant because it was the first official instruction by the Islamic State for its supporters to kill non-Muslims in Western countries. This speech has been credited with inspiring a wave of Islamic terrorism in Europe. Among other things, Al-Adnani said: If you can kill a disbelieving American or European \u2013 especially the spiteful and filthy French \u2013 or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him. On 30 August 2016, the Islamic State announced that Adnani was killed in Aleppo Province. The Russian Federation claimed that Adnani had been killed in a Tuesday (30 August 2016) Russian airstrike. Specifically, the Russian Defense Ministry indicated on August 31 that al-Adnani was killed in the Maarat Umm Hawsh area of Aleppo as result of an airstrike conducted by a Russian Su-34 bomber, a strike which targeted and hit a group of about 40 Islamic State fighters. On 13 September, Kremlin-controlled Sputnik News contended that while Russia's version of events was \"more likely\" than the Pentagon's, it was also possible that Adnani had been killed by Islamic State rivals, or might even still be alive. An unnamed U. S. defense official said, \"coalition forces conducted an airstrike in al-Bab, Syria, targeting an ISIL senior leader\" and were still trying to confirm whether he was killed. A U. S. defense official called the Russian claim to have killed al-Adnani \"preposterous\" and \"a joke\" and said they stand by the statement made on August 30 that U. S. forces conducted the strike that targeted al-Adnani. Also, earlier in the day on 30 August 2016, a U. S. military intelligence official stated that al-Adnani was wounded several days previous and succumbed to his injuries in al-Bab. Ammar Waqqaf, founder and director of Gnosos think tank, stated in an interview with RT that al-Adnani's death is a setback for IS given his role in Islamic State propaganda and his senior level adding \"It will take time for them [ISIL] to replace him, but we shouldn't be singing chants of joy yet, because [ISIL] probably thought that some of them would have been killed and the replacement would be in the pipeline. \"The U. S. Department of Defense confirmed on 12 September that al-Adnani had been killed in an airstrike on 30 August near al-Bab. After his death al-Adnani was featured on the cover of first issue of new ISIL propaganda magazine called Rumiyah that praised his life as a jihadist and his 'martyrdom'. It repeatedly stated that the killing of al-Adnani will only strengthen the outfit as there are many who will follow his path and replace him. He wrote a number of books, including the likes of The Context of Jihad and Its Related Issues and Verses on the Jurisprudence of Jihad, that he penned while being imprisoned by the Americans, and many of his publications eventually served as textbooks for al-Qaeda and later ISIS fighters in training camps, where he also used to teach matters like Arabic language and grammar as well as Islamic law.

The king chose a name of Sanskrit origin, Bhumibol Adulyadej (Devanagari: \u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f\u092c\u0932 \u0905\u0924\u0941\u0932\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947\u091c, IAST: Bh\u016bmibala Atulyateja), a compound of Bh\u016bmi (\u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f), meaning \"Land\"; Bala (\u092c\u0932), meaning \"Strength\" or \"Power\"; Atulya (\u0905\u0924\u0941\u0932\u094d\u092f), meaning \"Incomparable\"; and Tej (\u0924\u0947\u091c), meaning \"Power\". Thus, Bh\u016bmibala Atulyateja, or Bhumibol Adulyadej as it is transliterated in Thai, can be literally translated as \"Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power\". Bhumibol was born at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States, on 5 December 1927. He was the youngest son of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, and his commoner wife Mom Sangwan (later Princess Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother). His father was enrolled in the public health program at Harvard University, which is why Bhumibol was the only monarch to be born in the US. Bhumibol had an older sister, Princess Galyani Vadhana, and an older brother, Prince Ananda Mahidol. Bhumibol came to Thailand in 1928, after his father obtained a certificate from Harvard. His father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when Bhumibol was less than two years old. He briefly attended Mater Dei school in Bangkok, but in 1933 his mother took her family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the \u00c9cole nouvelle de la Suisse romande in Lausanne. In 1934 Bhumibol was given his first camera, which ignited his lifelong enthusiasm for photography. When Bhumibol's childless uncle Prajadhipok abdicated in 1935, his nine-year-old brother Ananda Mahidol became King Rama VIII. However, the family remained in Switzerland and the affairs of the head of state were conducted by a regency council. They returned to Thailand for only two months in 1938. In 1942, Bhumibol became a jazz enthusiast, and started to play the saxophone, a passion that he kept throughout his life. He received the baccalaur\u00e9at des lettres (high-school diploma with a major in French literature, Latin, and Greek) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal de Lausanne, and by 1945 had begun studying sciences at the University of Lausanne, when World War II ended and the family was able to return to Thailand. Bhumibol ascended the throne following the death by gunshot wound of his brother, King Ananda Mahidol, on 9 June 1946, under circumstances that remain unclear. While a first government statement stated that Ananda had accidentally shot himself, an investigation committee ruled this was virtually impossible. Two palace aides were eventually convicted of regicide and executed. A third possibility, that Bhumibol accidentally shot his brother while the brothers played with their pistols, was never officially considered. Bhumibol succeeded his brother, but returned to Switzerland before the end of the 100-day mourning period. Despite his interest in science and technology, he changed his major and enrolled in law and political science to prepare for his duties as head of state. His uncle, Rangsit, Prince of Chainat, was appointed Prince Regent. In Bhumibol's name, Prince Rangsit acknowledged a military coup that overthrew the government of Thamrongnawasawat in November 1947. The regent also signed the 1949 constitution, which returned to the monarchy many of the powers it had lost by the 1932 Revolution. In December 1946, the Siamese government allocated several hundred thousand dollars for the ceremonial cremation of the remains of the late King Ananda, a necessary preliminary to the coronation of Bhumibol who was required by religious custom to light the funeral pyre. Unsettled conditions in 1947 following a coup d'\u00e9tat resulted in a postponement, and court astrologers determined that 2 March 1949 was the most auspicious date. While doing his degree in Switzerland, Bhumibol visited Paris frequently. It was in Paris that he first met Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France (Nakkhatra Mangala) and a great-granddaughter of King Chulalongkorn and thus a cousin of Bhumibol. She was then 15 years old and training to be a concert pianist. On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol was driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he collided with the rear of a braking truck 10 km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half of his face and incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye. Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by The New York Times as \"the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas\". The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana. Bhumibol and Sirikit have four children: (Formerly HRH) Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, born 5 April 1951 in Lausanne, Switzerland; married Peter Ladd Jensen (now divorced), and has two daughters. Her son, Bhumi Jensen, was killed in the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. King Maha Vajiralongkorn (Rama X), born 28 July 1952; married Mom Luang Soamsawali Kitiyakara (later divorced and became HRH the Princess Niece); one daughter. Then married Yuvadhida Polpraserth (later divorced); four sons and a daughter. Third marriage was to Srirasmi Suwadee (now divorced); one son. Fourth and current marriage is to Suthida Tidjai. HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, born 2 April 1955; never married, no issue HRH Princess Chulabhorn Walailak, born 4 July 1957; married Virayudh Tishyasarin (now divorced); two daughters After presiding over the long-delayed, ceremonial cremation of his brother Ananda Mahidol, Bhumibol was crowned King of Thailand on 5 May 1950 in the Baisal Daksin Throne Hall in the Grand Palace in Bangkok. It was the first coronation ceremony of a Thai sovereign to rule under the system of constitutional monarchy. During the ceremony, he pledged that he would \"reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese people\" (\"\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e41\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e19\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e42\u0e22\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\"). Notable elements associated with the coronation included the Bahadrabith Throne beneath the Great White Umbrella of State and royal regalia and utensils. In 1950 on Coronation Day, Bhumibol's consort was made queen (Somdej Phra Boromarajini). The date of his coronation is celebrated each 5 May in Thailand as Coronation Day, a public holiday. On 9 June 2006, Bhumibol celebrated his 60th anniversary as the King of Thailand, becoming the longest reigning monarch in Thai history. The royal couple spent their honeymoon at Hua Hin before they returned to Switzerland, where the king completed his university studies. They returned to Thailand in 1951. Following the death of his grandmother Queen Savang Vadhana, Bhumibol entered a 15-day monkhood (22 October 1956 \u2013 5 November 1956) at Wat Bowonniwet, as is customary for Buddhist males on the death of elder relatives. He was ordained by the Supreme Patriarch on 22 October 1956 at the Royal Chapel of the Emerald Buddha in the Grand Palace. During this time, Sirikit was appointed his regent. She was later appointed Queen Regent (Somdej Phra Boromarajininat) in recognition of this. Although Bhumibol was sometimes referred to as King Rama IX in English, Thais referred to him as Nai Luang or Phra Chao Yu Hua (\u0e43\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07 or \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27), which translated to \"the King\" and \"Lord Upon our Heads\", respectively. He was also called Chao Chiwit (\"Lord of Life\"). Formally, he was referred to as Phrabat Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e08\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27) or, in legal documents, Phrabat Somdet Phra Paraminthara Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e08\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e21\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e38\u0e25\u0e22\u0e40\u0e14\u0e0a), and in English as \"His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej\". He signed his name as \u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e38\u0e25\u0e22\u0e40\u0e14\u0e0a \u0e1b. \u0e23. (Bhumibol Adulyadej Por Ror, the Thai equivalent of \"Bhumibol Adulyadej R[ex])\". In 1957, a military coup overthrew the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram with allegations of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, corruption and manipulation of the election held earlier that year. This began a new and long-lasting relationship between the monarch and military, leading some to perceive that the king condones the Thammasat University massacre in defense of his throne, and support a series of military dictatorships. However, during his interview given to the BBC in 1979, the king reiterated that the monarchy should remain impartial and be in peaceful co-existence with everybody. Bhumibol invited public criticism in a 2005 speech, but the l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws have not been revoked by the Thai parliament yet. In the early years of his reign, during the government of military dictator Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Bhumibol had no real political power and was little more than a ceremonial figure under the military-dominated government. In August 1957, six months after parliamentary elections, General Sarit Thanarat accused the government of Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 due to its conduct of the 2,500th anniversary celebration of Buddhism. On 16 September 1957, Phibunsongkhram went to Bhumibol to seek support for his government. Bhumibol advised the field marshal to resign to avoid a coup. Phibunsongkhram refused. That evening, Sarit Thanarat seized power. Two hours later Bhumibol imposed martial law throughout the kingdom. Bhumibol issued a proclamation appointing Sarit as \"military defender of the capital\" without anyone countersigning the proclamation. It included the following: Whereas it appears that the public administration by the government under the premiership of Field Marshal P. Phibunsongkhram is untrustworthy, and that the government could not maintain the public order; and whereas the military, led by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, has successfully taken over the public administration and now acts as the Military Defender of the Capital; now, therefore, I do hereby appoint Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat as the Military Defender of the Capital, and command that all the citizens shall remain calm whilst all the government officers shall serve the orders issued by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat. This Proclamation shall come into force immediately. Done this 16th Day of September, Buddhist Era 2500 (1957). Sarit later admitted in a rare interview with foreign correspondent that the king had no involvement and did not acknowledge anything about the coup until it had been done successfully. During Sarit's dictatorship, the monarchy was revitalised. Bhumibol attended public ceremonies, toured the provinces and patronised development projects, he also visited the United States and many countries in Europe. Under Sarit, the practice of crawling in front of royalty during audiences, banned by King Chulalongkorn, was revived in certain situations and the royal-sponsored Thammayut Nikaya order was revitalised. For the first time since the absolute monarchy was overthrown, a king was conveyed up the Chao Phraya River in a Royal Barge Procession to offer robes at temples. Other disused ceremonies from the classical period of the Chakri Dynasty, such as the royally patronised ploughing ceremony (Thai: \u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e07\u0e04\u0e25), were also revived. Bhumibol's birthday (5 December) was declared the national day, replacing the previous national day, the anniversary of the Siamese revolution of 1932 (24 June). Upon Sarit's death on 8 December 1963, an unprecedented 21 days of mourning were declared in the palace. A royal five-tier umbrella shaded his body while it lay in state. Long-time royal adviser Phraya Srivisarn Vacha later noted that no Prime Minister ever had such an intimate relationship with Bhumibol as Sarit. Bhumibol biographer Paul Handley, in The King Never Smiles, writes that the dictator Sarit was Bhumibol's tool. Political scientist Thak Chaloemtiarana writes that Sarit used Bhumibol in order to build his own credibility. Following Sarit's death General Thanom Kittikachorn rose to power to lead Thailand's military dictatorship, ultimately challenged by the 1973 Thai popular uprising. Bhumibol initially asked student protestors to disband. When police attacked and killed dozens of students, sparking protest riots, Bhumibol announced general Thanom's resignation and departure from Thailand. According to William Stevenson, the king had asked the three tyrants to avoid bloodshed, although the three tyrants had agreed, they later changed their minds. Eventually, it led to the incidents of October 1973. Bhumibol distanced himself from the Thai military after Thanom's fall. Political events in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos brought powerful guerrilla and communist movements into power or prominence, which threatened the Thai monarchy and political establishment. Fearing unrest, Bhumibol began to court the military in 1975, visiting camps throughout the country, and publicly warning of internal and external threats. At this time, Bhumibol increasingly cultivated far-right militias and paramilitary forces, including the Red Gaurs and the Village Scouts, warning that students and political dissidents planned to bring communists to power in Thailand. Finally, Bhumibol provoked outrage among students and legal groups by inviting general Thanom back into the country. The ensuing chaos was used as a pretext for a military coup, which Bhumibol backed and described as a manifestation of the people's will. The event that catalyzed the coup was the Thammasat University massacre, carried out in the name of defending Bhumibol's throne. The victorious military junta submitted three names to the king as possible premiers: Deputy President of the king's Privy Council Prakob Hutasingh, right-wing Bangkok Governor Thamnoon Thien-ngern, and staunchly anti-communist Supreme Court judge Thanin Kraivichien. Thanin was a member of the Nawaphon monarchist paramilitary group, which had the backing of the CIA, and which Bhumibol was alleged to have sponsored. Bhumibol chose Thanin as the most suitable premier, leading student protesters to flee to join the communists in the jungle. Thanin was overthrown in a military coup in October 1977 led by General Kriangsak Chamanan. Kriangsak was succeeded in 1980 by the popular Army Commander-in-Chief, General Prem Tinsulanonda, who later became the Privy Council President. Bhumibol's refusal to endorse military coups in 1981 (the April Fool's Day coup) and 1985 (the Share Rebellion) ultimately led to the victory of forces loyal to the government, despite some violence \u2013 including, in 1981, the seizure of Bangkok by rebel forces. The coups led many to believe that Bhumibol had misjudged Thai society and that his credibility as an impartial mediator between various political and military factions had been compromised. Following the death of Emperor Hirohito of Japan in 1989, he overtook the distinction as the world's longest-reigning living monarch. In 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand's transition to a democratic system. A coup on 23 February 1991 returned Thailand to military dictatorship. After a general election in 1992, the majority parties invited General Suchinda Kraprayoon, a leader of the coup group, to be prime minister. This caused much dissent, which escalated into demonstrations that led to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as police and military forces clashed with protesters. Violence and riots spread to many areas of the capital with rumours of a rift among the armed forces. Amidst the fear of civil war, Bhumibol intervened. He summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, retired Major General Chamlong Srimuang, to a televised audience, and urged them to find a peaceful resolution. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation, and led to Suchinda's resignation soon afterwards. It was one of the few occasions in which Bhumibol directly and publicly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward, leading to a civilian government. In his 4 December 2002 speech on the eve of his birthday, King Bhumibol spoke about the rise in drug use, the high social costs and deaths caused by drugs. Privy Councillor General Phichit Kunlawanit called on the Thaksin Shinawatra government to use its majority in parliament to establish a special court to deal with drug dealers, stating that \"if we execute 60,000 the land will rise and our descendants will escape bad karma\". On 14 January 2003, Thaksin launched a campaign to rid \"every square inch of the country\" of drugs. His \"war on drugs\" campaign consisted of setting provincial arrest and seizure quotas including \"blacklists\", awarding government officials for achieving targets, and threatening punishment for those who failed to make the quota, targeted dealers, and propagated a ruthless carrying out of the campaign. In the first three months, Human Rights Watch reported that 2,275 people were killed, almost double the number normally killed in drug-related violence. Human rights critics claimed a large number were extrajudicially executed. The War on Drugs was widely criticized by the international community. According to the Narcotics Control Board, the campaign was effective in reducing drug consumption, especially in schools. Bhumibol, in a 2003 birthday speech, warned Thaksin and criticized those who counted only dead drug dealers while ignoring deaths caused by drugs. \"Victory in the War on Drugs is good. They may blame the crackdown for more than 2,500 deaths, but this is a small price to pay. If the prime minister failed to curb [the drug trade], over the years the number of deaths would easily surpass this toll. \"After the 2006 coup, the military junta appointed a committee led by former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn to investigate deaths in the war on drugs. The committee found that over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drug trade and blamed the violence on a government \"shoot-to-kill\" policy based on flawed blacklists. However, no one has been prosecuted, with interim Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont stating that there was insufficient evidence to take legal action. While he was opposition leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva accused Thaksin of crimes against humanity in the war on drugs. After he became Prime Minister, Abhisit opened an investigation led by former attorney-general Kampee Kaewcharoen, claiming that a successful probe could lead to prosecution by the International Criminal Court. Weeks before the April 2006 legislative election, the Democrat Party-led opposition and the People's Alliance for Democracy petitioned Bhumibol to appoint a replacement prime minister and cabinet. Demands for royal intervention were met with much criticism from the public. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, \"Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational\". After publicly claiming victory in the boycotted April parliamentary elections, Thaksin Shinawatra had a private audience with the king. A few hours later, Thaksin appeared on national television to announce that he would be taking a break from politics. In May 2006, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned Manager Daily newspaper published a series of articles describing the \"Finland Plot\", alleging that Thaksin and former members of the Communist Party of Thailand planned to overthrow the king and seize control of the nation. No evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers. In a rare, televised speech to senior judges, Bhumibol requested the judiciary to take action to resolve the political crisis. On 8 May 2006, the Constitutional Court invalidated the results of the April elections and ordered new elections scheduled for 15 October 2006. The Criminal Court later jailed the Election Commissioners. On 14 July 2006, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda addressed graduating cadets of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, telling them that the Thai military must serve the nation and the king\u2014not the government. On 20 July, Bhumibol signed a royal decree endorsing new House elections for 15 October 2006. In an unprecedented act, the King wrote a note on the royal decree calling for a clean and fair election. That very day, Bhumibol underwent spinal surgery. On the evening of 19 September, the Thai military overthrew the Thaksin government and seized control of Bangkok in a bloodless coup. The junta, led by the Sonthi Boonyaratglin, Commander of the Army, called itself the Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarchy. It accused the deposed prime minister and his regime of crimes, including l\u00e8se majest\u00e9, and pledged its loyalty to Bhumibol. Martial law was declared, the constitution repealed and the October elections cancelled. Protests and political meetings were banned. The king's role in the coup was the subject of much speculation among Thai analysts and the international media, although publication of such speculation was banned in Thailand. The king had an audience with Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda at the same time that special forces troops were mobilised. Anti-coup protesters claimed that Prem was the mastermind of the coup, although the military claimed otherwise and banned any discussion of the topic. In a BBC interview, Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University noted, \"This coup was nothing short of Thaksin versus the King. . . He [the king] is widely seen as having implicitly endorsed the coup. \" In the same interview, social critic Sulak Sivaraksa claimed, \"Without his [the king's] involvement, the coup would have been impossible. \" Sulak added that the king is \"very skillful. He never becomes obviously involved. If this coup goes wrong, Sonthi will get the blame, but whatever happens, the King will only get praise. \" On Saturday, 23 September 2006, the junta warned it would \"urgently retaliate against foreign reporters whose coverage has been deemed insulting to the monarchy. \" Prem did help secure the appointment of Surayud Chulanont, another member of the King's Privy Council, as Premier, and allegedly had a say in the appointment of Surayud's Cabinet. Critics claimed the cabinet was full of \"Prem's boys\". On 20 April 2009, Thaksin claimed in an interview with the Financial Times that Bhumibol had been briefed by Privy Councillors Prem Tinsulanonda and Surayud Chulanont about their plans to stage the 2006 coup. He claimed that General Panlop Pinmanee, a leader of the People's Alliance for Democracy, had told him of the briefing. The Thai embassy in London denied Thaksin's claims. The junta appointed a constitutional tribunal to rule on alleged polling fraud involving the Thai Rak Thai and Democrat political parties. Guilty rulings would have dissolved both parties, Thailand's largest and oldest, respectively, and banned the parties' leadership from politics for five years. The weeks leading up to the verdicts saw rising political tensions. On 24 May 2007, about a week before the scheduled verdict, Bhumibol gave a rare speech to the Supreme Administrative Court (the president of which is also a member of the constitutional tribunal). \"You have the responsibility to prevent the country from collapsing\", he warned them in the speech, which was shown on all national television channels simultaneously during the evening. \"The nation needs political parties. . . In my mind, I have a judgment but I cannot say\", he said. \"Either way the ruling goes, it will be bad for the country, there will be mistakes\". The tribunal later acquitted the Democrat Party, but dissolved the Thai Rak Thai Party and banned 111 of its executives from politics for five years. The junta-appointed Constitution Drafting Assembly later tried to use the King in a propaganda campaign to increase public support for its widely criticised draft constitution. The CDA placed billboards saying \"Love the King. Care about the King. Vote in the referendum\" throughout northeast Thailand, where opposition to the junta was greatest. The military's constitution passed the referendum, and a general election was held in December 2007. The People's Power Party (PPP), consisting of many former Thai Rak Thai Party MPs and supporters, won the majority and formed a government. The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) refused to accept the election results and started protests, eventually laying siege to Government House, Don Mueang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Although the PAD claimed they were defending the monarchy, Bhumibol remained silent. However, after a PAD supporter died in a clash with police, Queen Sirikit presided over her cremation. Princess Sirindhorn, when asked at a U. S. press conference whether PAD was acting on behalf of the monarchy, replied, \"I don't think so. They do things for themselves. \" Questioning and criticism over Bhumibol's role in the crisis increased, particularly from the international press. \"It is more and more difficult for them to hold the illusion that the monarchy is universally adored\", says a Thai academic. In April 2008, Bhumibol appointed alleged coup plotter General Surayud Chulanont to the Privy Council of Thailand. In the weeks leading up to the 2011 general election, Bhumibol appointed Air Chief Marshal Chalit Pukbhasuk, a leader of the 2006 military coup, to his privy council. Bhumibol suffered from lumbar spinal stenosis, and received a microsurgical decompression for the condition in July 2006. He was admitted to the hospital in October 2007 and diagnosed with a blood shortage to his brain. He received treatment for various ailments including heart problems and was released after three weeks. Bhumibol was again admitted to Siriraj Hospital in September 2009, apparently suffering from flu and pneumonia. In 2011, it was revealed as part of WikiLeaks's leak of United States diplomatic cables that he had suffered from Parkinson's disease and depression. He was diagnosed with diverticulitis in hospital in November 2011, and was treated for the condition in January 2012. Bhumibol suffered minute subdural bleeding in the left frontal area of his brain for which he was treated in July 2012. Bhumibol left the hospital in July 2013, and travelled to Klai Kangwon Palace at Hua Hin on 2 August 2013, but returned intermittently in the following years, most recently on 1 June 2015. Bhumibol was too ill to appear for the public celebration of his birthday on 5 December 2015, but made a televised appearance on 14 December, his first in several months. The King temporarily left hospital to visit Chitralada Royal Villa on 11 January 2016 but returned later that day. On 1 October 2016, the palace released a bulletin stating that after recovering from a fever, King Bhumibol underwent tests that revealed a blood infection and an X-ray found inflammation on his left lung, along with water in his lungs. He had been in kidney failure for some time and received dialysis. By 9 October, he had been placed on a ventilator and doctors pronounced him \"not yet stable\". Crowds of well-wishers, many dressed in pink symbolizing good health and luck, gathered outside Siriraj Hospital and the Grand Palace to offer prayers and support. By 12 October, the royal children had arrived at Siriraj Hospital and Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn had met with the prime minister. There are few concerns about the succession of the crown prince, although he is not as respected as his father and speculation had it that some palace elites, responding to the people's admiration for Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, might try to position her to take the throne. King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand on 13 October 2016, at 15:52 local time, at the age of 88, as announced by the royal palace later that day. The following day, his body was taken by motorcade to the Grand Palace for the customary bathing rite. Thousands of the bereaved public lined the route, demonstrating their affection for their \"king of kings\". The royal procession arrived at the Grand Palace through Viset Chaisri Gate at 17:00. His only son and the next in line to rule the kingdom, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, presided over the bathing ritual at Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall. A royal cremation ceremony took place over five days at the end of October 2017. The actual cremation, which was not broadcast on television, was held in the late evening of 26 October 2017. Following cremation his remains and ashes were taken to the Grand Palace and were enshrined at the Chakri Maha Phasat Throne Hall (royal remains), the Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit and the Wat Bowonniwet Vihara Royal Temple (royal ashes). Following burial, the mourning period officially ended on midnight of 30 October 2017 and Thais have resumed wearing regular colours, while awaiting the future coronation of King Vajiralongkorn, which was hosted between 4\u20136 May 2019. Bhumibol retained enormous powers, partly because of his immense popularity and partly because his powers \u2013 although clearly defined in the Thai constitution \u2013 were often subject to conflicting interpretations. This was highlighted by the controversy surrounding the appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as Auditor-General. Jaruvan had been appointed by The State Audit Commission, but in July 2004, the Constitutional Court ruled that her appointment was unconstitutional. Jaruvan refused to vacate her office without an explicit order from Bhumibol, on the grounds that she had previously been royally approved. When the Senate elected a replacement for Jaruvan, Bhumibol refused to approve him. The Senate declined to vote to override Bhumibol's veto. Finally in February 2006 the Audit Commission reinstated Jaruvan when it became clear from a memo from the Office of the King's Principal Private Secretary that King Bhumibol supported her appointment. Bhumibol only vetoed legislation on rare occasions. In 1976, when the Parliament voted 149\u201319 to extend democratic elections down to district levels, Bhumibol refused to sign the law. The Parliament refused to vote to overturn the King's veto. In 1954, Bhumibol vetoed parliamentary-approved land reform legislation twice before consenting to sign it. The law limited the maximum land an individual could hold to 50 rai (80,000 square metres (860,000 sq ft)), at a time when the Crown Property Bureau was the kingdom's largest land-owner. The law was not enforced as General Sarit soon overthrew the elected government in a coup and repealed the law. Bhumibol had the constitutional prerogative to pardon criminals, although there are several criteria for receiving a pardon, including age and remaining sentence. The 2006 pardoning of several convicted child rapists, including an Australian rapist and child pornographer, caused controversy. However, under the Thai constitution, the king has the prerogative to grant pardons and all laws, royal rescripts, and royal commands relating to state affairs must be countersigned by a minister unless otherwise provided for in the constitution. Several academics outside Thailand, including Duncan McCargo and Federico Ferrara, noted the active but indirect political involvement of Bhumibol through a \"network monarchy\", whose most significant proxy is Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda. McCargo claimed that Bhumibol's conservative network worked behind the scenes to establish political influence in the 1990s, but was threatened by the landslide election victories of Thaksin Shinawatra in 2001 and 2005. Ferrara claimed, shortly before the Thai Supreme Court delivered its verdict to seize Thaksin Shinawatra's assets, that the judiciary was a well-established part of Bhumibol's network and represented his main avenue to exercise extra-constitutional prerogatives despite having the appearance of being constitutional. He also noted how, in comparison to the Constitutional Court's 2001 acquittal of Thaksin, the judiciary was a much more important part of the \"network\" than it was in the past. The network's ability to exercise power is based partly on Bhumibol's popularity and strict control of Bhumibol's popular image. According to Jost Pachaly of the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, Bhumibol \"plays an important role behind the scenes. But the role is difficult to assess because nothing is reported about it and no one really knows anything specific\", due to lese majeste laws forbidding discussion about Bhumibol's political activities. Bhumibol's popularity was demonstrated following the 2003 Phnom Penh riots in Cambodia, when hundreds of Thai protesters, enraged by rumors that Cambodian rioters had stomped on photographs of Bhumibol, gathered outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok. Photographs of the stomping were not published in Thailand, but were available on the internet. The situation was resolved peacefully only when Police General Sant Sarutanonda told the crowd that he had received a call from royal secretary Arsa Sarasin conveying Bhumibol's request for calm. The crowd dispersed. The development of the country must be fostered in stages. It must start with the construction of infrastructure, that is, the provision of food and basic necessities for the people by methods which are economic, cautious and conforming with principles. Once the foundation is firmly established, progress can be continually, carefully and economically promoted. This approach will prevent incurring mistakes and failures, and lead to the certain and complete achievement of the objectives. Bhumibol was involved in many social and economic development projects. The nature of his involvement varied by political regime. The government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram (1951\u20131957) limited Bhumibol to a ceremonial role. During that period Bhumibol produced some films and operated a radio station from Chitlada Palace using personal funds. In the military governments of Sarit Thanarat and his successors (1958\u20131980), Bhumibol was portrayed as the \"development King\" and the inspiration for the economic and political goals of the regime. Royally ordered projects were implemented under the financial and political support of the government, including projects in rural areas and communities under the influence of the Communist Party of Thailand. Bhumibol's visits to these projects were heavily promoted by the Sarit government and broadcast in state-controlled media. During the governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda (1981\u20131987), the relationship between the Thai state and the monarch was at its closest. Prem, later to become President of Bhumibol's Privy Council, officially allocated government budgets and manpower to support royal projects. Most activities in this period involved the development of large-scale irrigation projects in rural areas. During the modern period (post-1988), the structured development of the royal projects reached its apex. Bhumibol's Chaipattana Foundation was established, promoting his \"sufficiency economy\" theory, an alternative to the export-oriented policies adopted by the period's elected governments. Following the 2006 coup, establishment of a \"sufficiency economy\" was enshrined in the constitution as being a primary goal of the government, and government financial support for royal projects was boosted. 'Sandwich' and 'Supersandwich' artificial rainmaking project under the Thailand Royal Rainmaking Project Chai Pattana Waste Water Aerator, awarded gold medal by BKU (The Belgian Chamber of Inventors) at Brussels Eureka 2000 'Sufficiency Economy' Theory New Theory of Agriculture Use of Vetivar Grass for Soil Improvement, awarded the International Merit Award by the IECA (International Erosion Control Association) Kaem Ling Project, formation of detention basins Klaeng Din Project, acidic soil treatment Fai Maeo Project, formation of check dams Khun Dan Prakanchon Dam, Nakhon Nayok Province Pa Sak Jolasid Dam, Lop Buri Province Pa Sak River Basin Improvement Project Khlong Lat Pho Project, water diversion to prevent flooding in Bangkok Rama VIII Bridge Ratchadaphisek Road Bangkok Industrial Ring Road/Bhumibol Bridge Huai Ongkod Land Rehabilitation Project, Kanchanaburi Province Khao Hin Son Royal Development Study Centre, Chachoengsao Province Phikun Thong Royal Development Study Centre, Narathiwat Province Huai Sai Royal Development Study Centre, Phetchaburi Province Royal Medical Team. Bhumibol's private physicians accompanying him on village tours were encouraged to provide medical care for local residents. In addition, the Royal Household sends letters of support to physicians who volunteer to serve in hospitals in provinces where royal palaces are present. Also called the Diamond Jubilee, the 60th anniversary celebrations of the king's accession to the throne were a series of events marking Bhumibol's reign in June 2006. Events included a royal barge procession on the Chao Phraya River, fireworks displays, art exhibitions, and the pardoning of 25,000 prisoners, concerts, and dance performances. Tied in with the anniversary, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented Bhumibol with the United Nations Development Programme's first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award on 26 May 2006. National holidays were observed on 9 June and 12\u201313 June 2006. On 9 June, the king and queen appeared on the balcony of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall before hundreds of thousands of people. The official royal barge procession on 12 June was attended by the king and queen and royal visitors from 26 other countries. On 13 June, a state banquet for the royal visitors was held in the newly constructed Rama IX Throne Hall at the Grand Palace, the first official function of the hall. The Chiang Mai Royal Floral Expo was also held to honour the anniversary. On 16 January 2007, the CDRM officially declared the end of the 60th anniversary celebrations and commenced year-long celebrations of Bhumibol's 80th birthday. Bhumibol was a painter, musician, photographer, author and translator. His book Phra Mahachanok is based on a traditional Jataka story of Buddhist scripture. The Story of Thong Daeng is the story of his dog Thong Daeng. In his youth, Bhumibol was greatly interested in firearms. He kept a carbine, a Sten gun and two automatic pistols in his bedroom, and he and his elder brother, King Ananda Mahidol, often used the gardens of the palace for target practice. There are two English-language books that provide extensive detail\u2014albeit not always verifiable\u2014about Bhumibol's life, especially his early years and then throughout his entire reign. One is The Revolutionary King (2001) by William Stevenson, the other is The King Never Smiles (2006) by Paul M. Handley. A third and earlier work, The Devil's Discus (1964), is also available in Thai and English. The latter two books are banned in Thailand, while the first has never been sold in the country due to its \"inaccuracies\", despite having been written with royal patronage. Bhumibol's creativity in, among other things, music, art and invention, was the focus of a two-minute long documentary created by the government of Abhibisit Vejjajiva that was screened at all branches of the Major Cineplex Group and SF Cinema City, the two largest cinema chains in Thailand. Bhumibol was an accomplished jazz saxophone player and composer, playing Dixieland and New Orleans jazz, and also the clarinet, trumpet, guitar, and piano. It is widely believed that his father, Mahidol Adulyadej, may have inspired his passion for artistic pursuits at an early age. Bhumibol initially focused on classical music exclusively for two years but eventually switched to jazz since it allowed him to improvise more freely. It was during this time that he decided to specialize in wind instruments, especially the saxophone and clarinet. By the time Bhumibol turned 18, he started to compose his own music with the first being Candlelight Blues. He continued to compose even during his reign following his coronation in 1946. Bhumibol performed with Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Benny Goodman, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter. Throughout his life, Bhumibol wrote a total of 49 compositions. Much of it is jazz swing but he also composed marches, waltzes, and Thai patriotic songs. His most popular compositions were Candlelight Blues, Love at Sundown, and Falling Rain which were all composed in 1946. Bhumibol's musical influences included Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Benny Carter, and Johnny Hodges. Bhumibol initially received general music training privately while he was studying in Switzerland, but his older brother, then King Ananda Mahidol, who had bought a saxophone, sent Bhumibol in his place. King Ananda would later join him on the clarinet. On his permanent return to Thailand in 1950, Bhumibol started a jazz band, Lay Kram, whom he performed with on a radio station he started at his palace. The band grew, being renamed the Au Sau Wan Suk Band and he would perform with them live on Friday evenings, occasionally taking telephoned requests. Bhumibol also performed with his band at Thai universities, composing anthems for the universities of Chulalongkorn, Thammasat, and Kasetsart. Bhumibol performed with Benny Goodman at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, in 1956, and later played at Goodman's home in New York in 1960. Many bands such as Les Brown and His Band of Renown, Claude Bolling Big Band, and Preservation Hall Jazz Band recorded some of Bhumibol's compositions and can still be heard in Thailand. A 1996 documentary, Gitarajan, was made about Bhumibol's music. Bhumibol still played music with his Au Sau Wan Suk Band in later years, but was rarely heard in public. In 1964, Bhumibol became the 23rd person to receive the Certificate of Bestowal of Honorary Membership on behalf of Vienna's University of Music and Performing Arts. In 2000, he was awarded the Sanford Medal for his contribution in music from Yale School of Music. He was the first Asian in both cases to be honored as such. In 2003, the University of North Texas College of Music awarded him an honorary doctorate in music. Bhumibol's influence is widely regarded as one reason why Thailand, and Bangkok in particular, has for decades had a strong jazz and improvised music \"scene\" relative to other Asian nations. Bhumibol was an accomplished sailor and sailboat designer. He won a gold medal for sailing in the Fourth Southeast Asian Peninsular (SEAP) Games in 1967, together with Princess Ubol Ratana whom he tied for points. This accomplishment was all the more remarkable given Bhumibol's lack of binocular depth perception. On 19 April 1966, Bhumibol also sailed the Gulf of Thailand from Hua Hin to Toey Ngam Harbour in Sattahip, covering 60 nautical miles (110 km) in a 17-hour journey on the \"Vega 1\", an OK Class dinghy he built. Like his father, a former military naval engineer, Bhumibol was an avid boat designer and builder. He produced several small sailboat designs in the International Enterprise, OK, and Moth classes. His designs in the Moth class included the \"Mod\", \"Super Mod\", and \"Micro Mod\". Bhumibol was a radio amateur with the call sign HS1A. He was also the patron of the Radio Amateur Society of Thailand (RAST). Bhumibol was the only Thai monarch to hold a patent. He obtained one in 1993 for a waste water aerator named \"Chai Pattana\", and several patents on rainmaking after 1955: the \"sandwich\" rainmaking patent in 1999 and the \"supersandwich\" patent in 2003. Estimates of the post-devaluation (c. 1997\u20131998) wealth of the royal household and the Crown Property Bureau (CPB) range from US$10\u201320 billion. In August 2008, Forbes published its 2008 version of The World's Richest Royals and King Bhumibol was listed first, with an estimated wealth of US$35 billion. A few days later, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand issued a statement that the Forbes report incorrectly conflated the wealth of the CPB and that of Bhumibol. In the 2009 Forbes list, the Thai government's objections were acknowledged, but Forbes justified the continued inclusion of the CPB's assets, as the bureau is responsible for handling the Crown's property and investments. The 2009 estimate was a reduced figure of US$30 billion due to declines in real estate and stocks, and this figure was also published in April 2014 by Business Spectator, which also confirmed that the CPB is the body responsible for the management of the Crown's wealth. The wealth and properties of Bhumibol and the royal family are managed by the Privy Purse. The CPB manages the assets of the Crown as an institution. It was established by law, but is directed without the involvement of the Thai government and reports only to the king. The CPB receives many state privileges. Although the minister of finance presides over the CPB's board of directors, final decisions were made solely by Bhumibol. During his lifetime Bhumibol was the only person who could view the CPB's annual report, which was not released to the public. Through the CPB, the Crown owns equity in many companies and massive amounts of land, including 3,320 acres in central Bangkok, as well as 13,200 acres of rural land. The CPB owns 32 percent of Siam Cement (worth US$12. 6 billion), 23 percent of Siam Commercial Bank (Thailand's largest bank), and interests in Christiani & Nielsen, Deves Insurance, and Shin Corporation. The CPB also lets or leases about 36,000 properties to third parties, including the sites of the Anantara Siam Bangkok Hotel, the Suan Lum Night Bazaar, Siam Paragon, and the Central World Tower. The CPB spearheaded a plan to turn Bangkok's historical Ratchadamnoen Avenue into a shopping street known as the \"Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Asia\" and in 2007, shocked longtime residents of traditional marketplace districts by serving them with eviction notices. The Crown's substantial income from the CPB, estimated to be at least five billion baht in 2004, is exempt from taxes. King Bhumibol was the owner of the Golden Jubilee Diamond, the largest faceted diamond in the world, which is estimated to be worth between US$4\u201312 million in April 2014. Although Bhumibol was held in great respect by many Thais, he was also protected by l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws which allowed critics to be jailed for three to fifteen years. After the Thammasat University Massacre in 1976, the laws were toughened during the dictatorship of royalist and anti-communist Premier Thanin Kraivichien. Criticism of any member of the royal family, the royal development projects, the royal institution, the Chakri Dynasty or any previous Thai king was also banned. During his 2005 birthday speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: \"Actually, I must also be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human\", he claimed. \"If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong. \" A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 prosecutions. L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010. Although l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 officially only applies to current kings, the law is very flexible in practice. Even after his death, Bhumibol remains protected by l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. American journalist Paul Handley, who spent thirteen years in Thailand, wrote the biography The King Never Smiles. The Information and Communications Ministry banned the book and blocked the book's page on the Yale University Press website in January 2006. In a statement dated 19 January 2006, Thai National Police Chief General Kowit Wattana said the book had \"contents which could affect national security and the good morality of the people\". The book provided a detailed discussion of Bhumibol's role in Thai political history, and it also analyzed the factors behind Bhumibol's popularity. William Stevenson, who had access to the royal court and the royal family, wrote the biography The Revolutionary King in 2001. An article in Time said the idea for the book was suggested by Bhumibol. Critics noted that the book displayed intimate knowledge about personal aspects of Bhumibol. However, the book was unofficially banned in Thailand and the Bureau of the Royal Household warned the Thai media about even referring to it in print. An official ban was not possible as it was written with Bhumibol's blessing. The book was criticised for factual inaccuracies, disrespecting Bhumibol (it refers to him by his personal nickname \"Lek\"), and proposing a controversial theory explaining the mysterious death of King Ananda. Stevenson said: \"The king said from the beginning the book would be dangerous for him and for me. \" Bhumibol's only son, Prince Vajiralongkorn, was given the title \"Somdej Phra Boroma Orasadhiraj Chao Fah Maha Vajiralongkorn Sayam Makutrajakuman\" (Crown Prince of Siam) on 28 December 1972 and made heir apparent (\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e23\u0e31\u0e0a\u0e17\u0e32\u0e22\u0e32\u0e17) to the throne in accordance with the Palace Law on Succession of 1924. On 5 December 1977, Princess Sirindhorn was given the title \"Siam Boromrajakumari\" (Princess Royal of Siam). Her title is often translated by the English-language press as \"Crown Princess\", although her official English-language title is simply \"Princess\". Although the constitution was later amended to allow the Privy Council to appoint a princess as successor to the throne, this would only occur in the absence of an heir apparent. This amendment is retained in Section 23 of the 1997 \"People's Constitution\". This effectively allowed Princess Sirindhorn to potentially be second in line to the throne, but did not affect Prince Vajiralongkorn's status as heir apparent. Recent constitutions of Thailand have made the amendment of the Palace Law of Succession the sole prerogative of the reigning king. According to Assoc.

The daughter of Persian parents, she was born in Haifa to prominent Bah\u00e1'\u00ed lineage. Her great-grandfather was Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the prophet of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, although she was not a member of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Community. Maliheh Afnan moved to Beirut with her family in 1949. She received a BA from the American University of Beirut and a MA in Fine Arts from the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design in Washington, D. C. . Afnan lived in Kuwait from 1963 to 1966, in Beirut from 1966 to 1974 and in Paris from 1974 until 1997, when she moved to London. Afnan's work has been shown primarily in France and in London. Her first solo show, in a Basel gallery in 1971, was organized by the American artist Mark Tobey. Her work is included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the British Museum in London, the Written Art Collection in Germany, the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris and the BAII Bank Collection in Paris. She died in London at the age of 80. As a child, Afnan was fascinated by written language and calligraphy. Her own mail came to her home in three languages- Arabic, English, and Hebrew. However, at the time, she couldn\u2019t read or write, and would instead fill pages with invented writing. This trend continued into her present works, where imagined writing and numbers are always present -- even in the landscapes. \u201cI love looking at scripts,\u201d She said. \u201cThey excite me visually and excite me even further when I can\u2019t read then because then it\u2019s so much more mysterious and they could be so many other things, rather than some banal statement. \u201d Later in life, she pulled more inspiration from Mark Tobey, who worked in abstract script. He mentored her while she visited Switzerland. While she did not express herself or works as being inherently political, Afnan was influenced by the world. During the Lebanese Civil War, she \u201ctook a blowtorch to\u201d her art. She says her work is composed of traces of the past -- not just hers, but the past of her family and predecessors as well. Her work is mostly done on paper, with palettes composed of browns, blacks, reds and browns. People have compared it to ancient scrolls and tablature. She pulled from a variety of influences, likely due to her upbringing in middle eastern culture and her education and later life in the western world. The art that brought her into the spotlight of the art world was her series entitled Veiled. After 9/11, Veiled drew from the stereotype of what Persian women looked like, due to the veils they would wear. Afnan took the veil and turned it into a different type of veil. Her Veiled series focuses on the non physical veils all humans have inside of themselves: \u201cVeiled emotions, veiled threats, veiled feelings. \u201d The material Afnan used for the veils over top of her works was medical gauze from the pharmacy. She took the gauze and colored it in blacks and browns, laying it over script, sometimes even making new forms with it. Afnan talked about her work as having layers, and enjoyed the idea of the \u201clayers\u201d of life showing themselves in her work. She demonstrated her pieces having the layers of old civilizations, and said her layers of color are similar to layers of the sun lain over the paper. While she isn\u2019t as known for them, Afnan also worked with plaster reliefs. She would create a mold and fill it with plaster, removing it once it is dry. She painted over the plaster using \u201cearth colors, burnt, rust colors. \u201dShe also created what one might call portraits, instead calling them personages. While portraits have specific models, hers are not of any person in particular. She referred to them as amalgamations of people she has known, people she has seen, and people she has imagined. Afnan rejected labels like \u201cMiddle Eastern Artist\u201d and \u201cFemale Artist,\u201d insisting those are just things that happen to be true. She believed that if instead of focusing on what makes people different, we should focus on our \u201ccommon denominator\u201d of humanity, and that the world would be better for it. She also expressed her love for accidents. Afnan said that she never planned her work ahead of time, and said \u201cOften the accident is much more profound than what you are planning to do and what you are doing. \" A story she told in accordance with this is one about an old plaster relief -- her old cat, while she was away, knocked over one of her plaster tablets. When she glued it back together, she discovered it looked \u201c10 times better\u201d than the original. This is hand in hand with her desire to see the funny side in everything. \u201cEven the most terrible tragedies have a funny side,\u201d she said. She believed it was the humor of tragic situations that kept things from getting too hopeless, no matter the situation. Afnan also expressed the belief that it is important to stick to your personal principles.

Clara Jeanne Agnelli was born in Turin on 7 April 1920 to Edoardo Agnelli, a businessman and member of the Agnelli family, and Donna Virginia Bourbon del Monte, a noblewoman. Her paternal grandfather, Giovanni Agnelli, was the founder of Fiat Automobiles. Her maternal grandfather was Carlo Bourbon del Monte, Prince di San Faustino. She was the sister of Countess Cristiana Brandolini d'Adda, Countess Susanna Rattazzi, Countess Maria Sole, Gianni Agnelli, Giorgio Agnelli, and Umberto Agnelli. In 1935, when Agnelli was fifteen years old, her father died in an airplane crash. Her mother died in a car accident in 1945. In November 1968 Agnellli went to the break-away state of Biafra in Nigeria to give money to secessionist leader C. Odumegwu Ojukwu on behalf of her family. Agnelli married Prince Tassilo zu F\u00fcrstenberg in 1938 when she was eighteen years old. The couple had three children, Prince Egon von F\u00fcrstenberg, Princess Ira von F\u00fcrstenberg, and Prince Sebastien von F\u00fcrstenberg. During her marriage Agnelli had an affair with Italian actor Giovanni Nuvoletti, whom she had met in Sestriere when she was twelve years old. She ran off with Nuvoletti and the two were eventually arrested, as adultery was illegal in Italy at the time. She had to sign a legal document renouncing her relationship with Nuvoletti in return for an annuity. She continued on with the affair, which angered her brother Gianni. Once divorce was legalized in Italy, Agnelli married Nuvoletti in 1974 in a civil ceremony and moved into the Villa Papadopoli. After the death of her first husband, she and Nuvoletti had a Catholic wedding ceremony at her villa's chapel in 1989. She published several cook books. Nuvoletti died in 2008. Agnelli died on 19 July 2016 at the hospital dell'Angelo di Mestre. She had a Catholic funeral at the Church of Santa Maria del Carmello in Mestre.

He ran one of the largest mining companies in the world, Vale SA, and in 2013 was voted by Harvard Business Review as the world\u2019s fourth best-performing chief executive officer behind Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos of Amazon. com and Yun Jong-Yong of Samsung. His clashes with Brazil's ruling Workers Party leadership, that began with the Financial crisis of 2007\u201308 and his firing of 2,000 workers, led to his ouster from Vale SA at the government's request in 2011. On March 19, 2016, he was killed, along with his wife, son, and daughter (and three others) when their plane crashed in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Agnelli was born May 3, 1959 in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, hailing from a lower-middle-class family of Italian origin (unrelated to the Agnellis who founded and ran Fiat) and in 1981 graduated with a degree in economics from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Armando Alvares Penteado (commonly referred to as FAAP). He was married to Andr\u00e9ia and they had two children, daughter Ana Carolina and son Jo\u00e3o. From 1981\u20131997, Agnelli held various positions at Banco Bradesco and became its Executive Director in 1998, the position he held until his leaving the bank in 2000. From 2000\u20132001, Agnelli was the President and CEO of the Brazilian holding company Bradespar that was founded by Banco Bradesco in order to allow the bank to spin off some of its industrial investments. Also from 2000\u20132001, Agnelli was the Chairman of the Board of Directors Vale SA, where, in 2001, he was named its President and CEO, the position he held until his ouster in 2011. From 2012 to his 2016 death, Agnelli was the Founding Partner and CEO of the private Brazilian holding group AGN Holding. In March 2011, while Agnelli was President and CEO of Vale SA, it was reported that this Brazilian mining giant was considering taking a 9% stake in the controversial Belo Monte Dam hydroelectric project, also known as the Amazon dam project. Barely two weeks after this announcement, Agnelli was voted out of office at the request of Brazil\u2019s government and replaced as CEO by long-time Vale SA executive Murilo Ferreira, who was more friendly to the ruling Workers Party and described as being an acquaintance of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff. Agnelli had previously clashed with former Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva after his firing of 2,000 workers in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, and had, also, accused members of Lula\u2019s Workers Party of trying to install loyalists at Vale SA and seek a bigger say in key decisions. Agnelli, along with his wife and two children, were among seven killed when their plane crashed into two homes on March 19, 2016, minutes after taking off from an airport in northern S\u00e3o Paulo while traveling to a wedding in Rio de Janeiro.

He was the first athlete from his country to win a gold medal at what is now known as the Commonwealth Games, when he won the 100 yards final in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on 31 July 1954. Michael Agostini was born on 23 January 1935 at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. His family had interests in sports: his father played football, his mother played hockey, and all his siblings participated in football and athletics events at St. Mary's College, where they studied. Agostini participated in athletics, football, and boxing in his school days. In 1952, at Kingston, he defeated Jamaican sprinter Herb McKenley, who had won one gold and two silver medals at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. On a scholarship, Agostini enrolled at Villanova University, where he received training from Jumbo Elliott. On 23 January 1954, his 19th birthday, he set a world indoor record for over 100 yards at Washington, beating Olympic champion Lindy Remigino. The same year, he competed in the 1954 Commonwealth Games at Vancouver, Canada, and won gold in the 100 yards race (9. 6). He defeated Canadian Don McFarlane (9. 7) and Australian Hec Hogan (9. 7), becoming the first athlete from Trinidad and Tobago to win gold at the Commonwealth Games. Hogan was then in the news for tying the world records of 100 yards (9. 3) and 100 m (10. 2) and was the most anticipated winner. Reports suggest that Hogan's performance was hampered after he was informed that Agostini had ironically stated in a pre-Games interview, \"Who the heck is Hogan?\" when questioned about him. In 1955 Agostini participated in the Pan American Games held in Mexico and won a silver and a bronze in the 100 m and 200 m races, respectively. He also won silver at the 1959 Chicago Pan American Games in the 100 m, a bronze in the 200 m, and another bronze in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay. In the next Commonwealth Games at Cardiff in 1958, he stood third in the 100 yards run behind Keith Gardner of Jamaica and Tom Robinson of Bahamas. Agostini won another gold in the 1959 British West Indies Championships in the 100 m and a bronze in the 200 m. Agostini had also represented Trinidad and Tobago at the Men's 100 m and Men's 200 m at the 1956 Summer Olympics, ranking 6th and 4th, respectively. Agostini retired from active sports in the late 1950s. He graduated with a degree in economics from Fresno State University, California, in 1958. In the late 1950s Agostini moved to Australia and married Pamela, with whom he had two daughters and two sons. He received Australian citizenship in 1961. He coached various sprinters, including Ralph Doubell, Andrew Ratcliffe, Peter Vassella, and Jenny Lamy. He worked as a freelance journalist and as a teacher for a brief time, and also served as editor and publisher for Track and Field magazine in the mid-1960s. He edited numerous periodicals and authored nine books. In 2007, Mike Agostini was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame. In his later years, he suffered from arthritis and pancreatic cancer. He died on 12 May 2016 of cancer in Sydney.

He was best known for his character Profesor Jirafales in Televisa's 1970s television show El Chavo del Ocho. Aguirre also participated in another well known television show of the era, El Chapul\u00edn Colorado, albeit less frequently. Rub\u00e9n Aguirre was born in Santa Anita in Saltillo, Coahuila. In his book Despu\u00e9s de Usted (After You, a common phrase used by his character Professor Jirafales), published in February 2015, he wrote about the difficulty of finding higher education institutions in Mexico during the mid 1950s, since there were very few schools. This is why in his late teenage years, he moved to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, to study in one of the most renowned universities of that time, the Escuela Superior de Agricultura \"Hermanos Escobar\", where he studied Agricultural Engineering. Once in Ju\u00e1rez, he would regularly cross into the United States, since according to his memories, \"it was so easy to cross the border back then, I remember I would put on my college jacket on and since the gringo would see that you were a student, he would let you through\". Rub\u00e9n Aguirre worked many times as a gardener in El Paso to make ends meet. It was in Ju\u00e1rez, as well, where he began his career in the media as an unofficial radio host and bullfighting commentator. His passion to become a radio announcer was so big that he paused his college education to travel to Mexico City and get his radio license. He returned to Ju\u00e1rez and began working as a radio host; he married his wife Consuelo de los Reyes, who he met at a bullfight, finished his degree in Agricultural Engineering with a minor in Mechanized Systems and some time after he moved to Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, where he began his acting career and met Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os. When he first began looking for acting work, he was told that at 6'5\", he was too tall. Nevertheless, despite his height, he was able to begin his acting career in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, working with a character named Pipo, a famous clown. His acting caught the eye of Mexican producer Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os who asked him to work with him in Mexico City. Aguirre went on to Mexico City where he worked on several television scripts with G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os, creator and main star of both El Chavo and El Chapul\u00edn Colorado. Aguirre garnered fame across Latin America when both El Chavo and El Chapul\u00edn Colorado became major international hits. The group of actors that comprised the casts of both shows toured often, and sometimes they would venture out on their own. Aguirre was not the exception, visiting such places as Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Brazil many times. Chespirito owned the rights to El Chavo and El Chapul\u00edn Colorado. After Aguirre's participation in both shows was over, he moved to Argentina and opened a circus there. Chespirito had no copyrights in Argentina, and Aguirre was able to name his circus El Circo del Profesor Jirafales. Some of Aguirre's acting roles were in: El Chavo del Ocho (1971-1992) - Professor Jirafales / Prof. Inocencio Jirafales 'Maistro Longaniza' El Chapul\u00edn Colorado (1973-1978) - Various Characters Santo y Blue Demon contra el Dr. Frankenstein (1974) El Moro de Cumpas (1977) - Se\u00f1or cura Lo Veo y no lo Creo (1977) Capulina Chisme Caliente (1977) La Hora del Jaguar (1978) El Chanfle (1979) - Sr. Matute Mi Caballo el Cantador (1979) - Padre Aparicio Chespirito (1980-1992) - Lucas Ta\u00f1eda / Sargento Refugio / Professor Jirafales Sabor a Sangre (1980) - Sacerdote Aventuras en Marte (1981) - Astronaut El Chanfle II (1982) - Sr. Matute Viva el Chubasco (1983) Don Rat\u00f3n y don Ratero (1983) - Rufino Rufi\u00e1n Charrito (1984) - Director Escuadr\u00f3n Sida (1987) Este Vampiro es un Tiro (1991) El Chivo (1992) - Padre Correa Fray Valentino II (1994) Las Aventuras de Fray Valentino (1994) - Fray Valentino El Show del Vampiro (2004) Biodata (video), Chespirito. org; accessed 17 June 2016.

Aherne narrated the Channel 4 reality television series Gogglebox from its inception in 2013 until 1 April 2016. Aherne was born in Ealing, London, to the family of an Irish railway worker, and from the age of two was brought up in Wythenshawe, Manchester. Like her brother, Patrick, Aherne had retinoblastoma in childhood, which left her partially sighted in one eye. She attended the Hollies Convent Grammar School in West Didsbury and then studied drama at Liverpool Polytechnic. Aherne began performing on the Manchester comedy circuit as characters such as Mitzi Goldberg, lead singer of the comedy country and western act the Mitzi Goldberg Experience, and Sister Mary Immaculate, an Irish nun. She developed her Mrs Merton character with Frank Sidebottom for his show on Piccadilly Radio, where she worked as a receptionist. Aherne's first TV appearances were as Mrs Merton in a semi-regular spot on the Granada TV discussion show Upfront in 1990. She had already recorded a pilot for Leeds-based Yorkshire TV of Mrs Murton's Nightcap, but they had not pursued the concept. She made brief appearances in The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer in 1993 and alongside Steve Coogan and John Thomson in a Granada TV pilot entitled The Dead Good Shows. She rose to prominence in 1994 as her created character Mrs Merton on the mock chat show The Mrs Merton Show under her married name of Caroline Hook. The guests were real-life celebrities, not actors, who found themselves the subject of outrageous faux-na\u00eff questions \u2013 in one memorable example the wife of magician Paul Daniels, Debbie McGee, was asked \"So, what first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?\"Another episode featured comedian Bernard Manning and actor Richard Wilson. Manning clashed with Wilson and Aherne as she asked him about his racist attitudes at one point saying, \u201cWho do you vote for now Hitler\u2019s dead?\u201d, although he acknowledged that One Foot in the Grave was funny. The series ran in various formats from 1994 to 1997, winning a BAFTA for Best Chat Show in 1997. The success of the show was partly attributed to the \"round vowel sounds of the North West accent\" which \"naturally sound safe and unthreatening\" and which allowed the character \"to ask the most outrageous, below-the-belt questions of her guest stars\". The Mrs Merton character was given a sitcom, Mrs Merton and Malcolm, which depicted her home life with her \"mummy's boy\" son (played by co-writer Craig Cash). This aspect of Malcolm's character was exaggerated to the point that many complained the series ridiculed those with learning difficulties. Mrs Merton and Malcolm lasted one series, and was released on DVD in 2008. Between 1994 and 1997 she appeared in and wrote for the BBC comedy series The Fast Show. One of her most notable characters was the \"Chanel 9 Neus\" meteorologist Poula Fisch, who invariably reported a temperature for all locations of 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) while exclaiming \"Scorchio!\" with apparent surprise. Other notable characters included the endlessly chattering northern Ren\u00e9e, wife of submissive husband Roy and supermarket Checkout Girl who, by way of conversation, would comment nosily and judgementally on each item a customer had bought. Her most popular creation is the situation comedy The Royle Family, which she co-created and wrote with Cash, and directed in its third series. The programme ran for three series from 1998 to 2000. Aherne starred alongside Ricky Tomlinson and Sue Johnston, as their daughter Denise Royle. The show was a commercial and critical success, and ran for three series with a total of twenty episodes as well as five one-offs made for showing at Christmas. After a 2000 spoof documentary with Cash entitled Back Passage to India, Aherne said The Royle Family would end in December 2000 after a Christmas special, and that she would not appear on television again, although she would continue to write. Aherne received BAFTAs for Best Sitcom in 2000 and 2007, and she won the BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance in 2000. She was nominated for directing in 2001. Following a disagreement with Cash, Aherne moved to Australia, retreating from the press. She wrote Dossa and Joe which was screened on BBC Two in 2002. Although critics applauded it, the show did not attract viewers and did not return for a second series. Returning to Britain, she began work on another sitcom with Cash but pulled out, after which Cash wrote Early Doors with Phil Mealey. After Dossa and Joe, Aherne avoided media attention. When The Fast Show was featured on the BBC One show Comedy Connections, Aherne was the only cast member not interviewed. In April 2006, the BBC said Aherne and Cash were developing a script for a one-off special of The Royle Family. The Royle Family: The Queen of Sheba was broadcast on 29 October 2006, to an audience of 7. 8 million. Aherne subsequently made few TV appearances. On 14 October 2008 she was in the BBC comedy drama written by Cash and Phil Mealey, Sunshine as a barmaid. She appeared in The Royle Family, The New Sofa on Christmas Day 2008. In 2009, she appeared in a Royle Family special for Comic Relief as well as another Christmas Day special of The Royle Family entitled The Golden Eggcup. She co-wrote the ITV comedy-drama The Fattest Man in Britain, which was broadcast in December 2009. In November 2010, Aherne appeared in the special The Royle Family: Behind the Sofa shown on Gold, featuring clips of The Royle Family and interviews with Aherne, Cash and the cast, which was followed by another Christmas Day special, Joe's Cracker. She narrated a BBC1 documentary series Pound Shop Wars broadcast in November 2012. She also appeared in The Fast Show internet specials, sponsored by the lager brand Fosters, which reunited most of the original principal cast; only Mark Williams was unable to participate. Aherne wrote the 2013 one-off sitcom The Security Men along with Jeff Pope for ITV. The episode starred Paddy McGuinness, Brendan O'Carroll, Dean Andrews, Bobby Ball and Peter Wight. Aherne's final role was as narrator of the Channel 4 comedy reality series Gogglebox, reflecting her character in The Royle Family, who would frequently be watching TV and commenting on it. Cash filled in when she was unavailable and took over the role permanently in April 2016. Aherne's final on screen appearance came in the Sky 1 show After Hours, where she was reunited with her old writing partner Craig Cash who produced and directed the show. She played the role of Sheila. Aherne was married to Peter Hook of the bands Joy Division and New Order from 1994 until 1997. During their marriage he appeared in her TV series The Mrs Merton Show as leader of Hooky & the Boys, the show's house band. After Aherne's death Hook described how she had been physically abusive towards him during their marriage. Her private life was well publicised, especially her depressions and struggles with alcohol and other drugs during the 1990s. Before The Royle Family began, she suffered from depression and after her former boyfriend, BBC technician Matt Bowers, succumbed to stomach cancer, she attempted suicide. The day after she checked into the Priory Hospital and was diagnosed as a binge alcoholic. It was after these events that she began The Royle Family where she tended to smoke branded cigarettes openly whilst sitting on a sofa throughout the TV sitcom. She suffered from bladder cancer and from a rare cancer of the retina. In 2014 she embarked on a programme of treatment for lung cancer. In June 2014 Aherne appeared in Manchester at the launch of the Macmillan Cancer Improvement Partnership (MCIP), a \u00a33. 4m scheme to coordinate cancer care in the city. She spoke about how a sense of humour had helped her cope with the disease. In 2016 Aherne became the voice behind the UK government's \"One You\" health campaign, to persuade people to cut down on cigarettes and alcohol. On the morning of 2 July 2016, Aherne died of lung cancer at her home in Timperley at the age of 52. Aherne had told family and close friends in May that she was terminally ill. Her private funeral took place on 14 July 2016. In October 2016, Steve Coogan paid tribute to Aherne at the Stand Up to Cancer 2016 event, speaking about her before a video was played of her TV moments and then Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds performed The Royle Family theme tune \"Half the World Away\".

At 4 feet 11 inches (1. 50 m) tall, he was given the name \"Pocket Hercules\". Since childhood Aich was interested in strength related sports, such as wrestling and weightlifting. At the age of 12, due to a sudden attack of black fever, his health broke down. He regained his strength, however, by physical fitness exercises. He started bodybuilding exercises such as doing push-ups, squats, pull-ups, leg raises, and traditional sit-ups. He only did bodyweight/calisthenics exercises with up to 100 reps per set at that age. He attended the Jubilee School in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While at school, he used to go to the Ruplal Byayam Samiti for physical exercises. He began to perform in shows titled Physique and Magic along with P. C. Sorcar in Dhanbad. He used to perform feats like bending steel with his teeth, bending spears with his neck and resting his belly on swords. Aich joined the Royal Air Force in 1942 where he began his pursuit in bodybuilding. He was introduced to weight training by Reub Martin, a British officer in the RAF. While part of the RAF, Aich was imprisoned for slapping a British officer in protest at the officer's remarks in favour of colonial oppression. Aich began his weight training seriously while in jail.

His work has been exhibited in America, Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. His paintings have been acquired by the French state, the City of Paris, The Museum of the History and Art of Luxemburg, the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the Federal Bank of Germany and Daimler-Benz, as well as many private collectors. Son of the distinguished animal artist, Erwin Aichele, A\u00efchele's Third Reich childhood is the subject of a 2011 book by the author and historian Giles Milton (who is also his son-in-law). It is called Wolfram: The Boy Who Went To War. A\u00efchele's work has been the subject of a number of critical studies, notably Franz Elgar's Wolfram. He is listed in G\u00e9rard Xurigu\u00e9ra's \"Le dessin, le pastel, l\u2019aquarelle dans l\u2019Art Contemporain\" A\u00efchele's childhood was spent in the artists\u2019 colony of Eutingen, near Pforzheim in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. His father, Erwin Aichele, worked from a studio in the grounds of the house. A\u00efchele developed an interest in folk art at an early age. He had a particular passion for the medieval Gothic art of southern Germany. Lucas Moser's altarpiece in Tiefenbron, the sculptures of Tilman Riemenschneider and the fortress architecture of Bad Wimpfen and other Swabian towns and villages all influenced his early artwork. At the age of 17, A\u00efchele decided to train as a sculptor and was accepted on a four-year woodcarving course at the Bavarian State Woodcarving School in Oberammergau. In 1942, A\u00efchele's studies were interrupted by the Second World War. He was conscripted into the German army and sent to the Crimea. Severe illness saw him transferred to a military hospital in Marienbad. Once recuperated, he was sent to Normandy where he served as a communications officer in the German 77th Infantry Division. He surrendered to American forces at the end of July, 1944 and spent the next two years as a prisoner of war, first in England and then in America. A\u00efchele returned to Oberammergau in 1946 and completed his sculpting course with distinction. One of his finest works, a processional church staff, is on display in the church of St Peter and St Paul in Oberammergau. The Bavarian State Woodcarving School was open in spirit: A\u00efchele discovered modern artists whose work had been banned under the Third Reich, notably Emil Nolde, Paul Klee and other artists of Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider). A\u00efchele continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Art in Stuttgart, where his tutor was the sculptor Otto Baum. He became particularly interested in religious - and especially Byzantine - art. In 1954, A\u00efchele embarked on an artistic pilgrimage to Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia and Mount Athos. He drew particular inspiration from the medieval monasteries of Kosovo, particularly Gracanica Monastery, Studenica Monastery and Sopocani Monastery, as well as the Byzantine treasures of Mount Athos. On returning to Germany, he became increasingly interested in iconography. He painted icons using the traditional technique of egg tempera. His aim was to return to the pure iconographical style represented by medieval masters such as Andrei Rublev - a style that had been corrupted in the 19th century. Among his works from this period is the iconostasis of the Russian Orthodox Church of St Mary Pokrov in D\u00fcsseldorf. A\u00efchele moved to Paris in 1956. He continued to paint icons but was increasingly drawing inspiration from elsewhere - Eastern European folk art, Persian miniatures and such modern artists as Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky and, above all, Marc Chagall and the masters of Cubism. In the 1970s, A\u00efchele began to be represented by the celebrated Parisian gallery owner Jean-Louis Roque and his work became known to a wider public. He was no longer painting icons: his preferred medium was now watercolour, through which he created his own highly idiosyncratic style. The influence of folk art and iconographical techniques can be seen in many works from this period. A\u00efchele also drew inspiration from his visits to the Alps: the forms of these mountain ranges are often visible in his paintings. In the late 1970s, Wolfram's work metamorphosed into a unique blend of figurative art and abstract art. The figurate elements provide the key to unlocking the abstract, whereby the tensions in the composition suddenly reveal a landscape with its horizons and points of light. Alongside his watercolours, A\u00efchele has also created different types of collage from paper that he has painted and then torn. These collages have a tactile quality that is enhanced by the intensity of the colour. In his later years, A\u00efchele worked in a smaller format, displaying particular interest in the interaction between figurative and abstract and shape and form, working with multiple horizons and shafts of light. He is represented by Galerie Capazza in Nancay, France. A 2009 exhibition in A\u00efchele's native Baden brought together works by eight artist members of the family. A\u00efchele married Barbara Rodi in 1964. They have two children, the jeweller Benedikt Aichele, and the artist and illustrator, Alexandra Milton. A\u00efchele lived in Paris.

She wrote poems, short stories and radio plays, and won multiple European literary prizes. Aichinger was born in 1921 in Vienna, along with her twin sister, Helga, to Berta, a doctor of Jewish ethnicity, and Ludwig, a teacher. As her mother's family was assimilated, the children were raised Catholic. Aichinger spent her childhood in Linz and, after her parents divorced, she moved to Vienna with her mother and sister, attending a Catholic secondary school. After the Anschluss in 1938, her family was subjected to Nazi persecution. As a half Jew she was not allowed to continue her studies and became a slave labourer in a button factory. Her sister Helga escaped from Nazism in July 1939 through a Kindertransport to England where she eventually gave birth to a daughter, who became English artist Ruth Rix. During World War II, Aichinger was able to hide her mother in her assigned room, in front of the Hotel Metropol, the Viennese Gestapo headquarters. But many relatives from her mother's side, among them her grandmother Gisela, whom she was particularly fond of, were sent to the Maly Trostenets extermination camp near Minsk, and murdered. In 1945, Aichinger began to study medicine at the University of Vienna, while writing in her spare time. In her first publication, Das vierte Tor (The Fourth Gate), she wrote about her experience under Nazism. In 1947 she and her mother Berta were able to travel to London and visit Aichinger's twin Helga and her daughter Ruth. The visit was the inspiration for a short story, \"Dover\". She gave up her studies in 1948 in order to finish her novel, Die gr\u00f6\u00dfere Hoffnung (\"The greater hope\", translated as Herod's Children). The book went on to become one of the top German-language novels of the twentieth century. It is a surrealist account of a child's persecution by the Nazis in Vienna. In 1949, Aichinger wrote the short story \"Spiegelgeschichte\" (English: \"Mirror Story\" or \"Story in a mirror\"). It was published in four parts in an Austrian newspaper, and is well known in Austria because it is part of the set of books taught in schools. The story is written backwards, beginning with the end of the biography of the unnamed woman, and ending with her early childhood. In 1949, Aichinger became a reader for publishing houses in Vienna and Frankfurt, and worked with Inge Scholl to found an Institute of Creative Writing in Ulm, Germany. In 1951, Aichinger was invited to join the writers' group Gruppe 47, a group which aimed to spread democratic ideas in post-war Austria. She read her story \"Spiegelgeschichte\" aloud at a meeting of the group, and leading group members such as Hans Werner Richter were impressed with the unusual narrative construction. The following year, she won the group's prize for best text, becoming the first female recipient. In 1956, she joined the Academy of Arts, Berlin. She was also a guest lecturer at the German Institute at the University of Vienna, teaching on literature and psychoanalysis. Reviewing a 1957 volume of her short works in translation, The Bound Man and Other Stories, Anthony Boucher describes Aichinger as \"a sort of concise Kafka,\" praising the title story, \"Der gefesselte Mann\" (\"The Bound Man\"), for its \"narrative use of multi-valued symbolism\", The similarity to Kafka's work has been frequently commented on, however other critics state that Aichinger's work goes beyond Kafka's in her emphasis on the emotional side of human suffering. After the death of her husband, the German poet G\u00fcnter Eich, in 1972, Aichinger and others edited his works and published them as Collected Works of Gunter Eich. In 1996, at the age of 75, she was the host of a German radio series Studio LCB for the Literary Colloquium Berlin. Aichinger died on 11 November 2016, aged 95. Aichinger met the poet and radio play author G\u00fcnter Eich through the Group 47 and they were married in 1953; they had a son Clemens (1954\u20131998), and in 1958 a daughter, Mirjam.

Aitchison was born in Kings Norton, Worcestershire. He was educated at Ellesmere College in Shropshire, leaving aged 15 to attend the Birmingham School of Art and then Slade School of Art. He married fellow art student Dorothy Self. He exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1939. He was deaf, excluding him from active service in the Second World War, but he worked for Vickers Aircraft as a technical illustrator. He produced drawings for the bouncing bomb designed by Barnes Wallis for the Dam Busters air raid. He became a freelance commercial artist after the war, producing drawings for a range of magazines. His earliest work was for Hulton Press' Lilliput magazine. He drew for Girl, filling in for Ray Bailey on \"Kitty Hawke and her All-Girl Air Crew\", and illustrating \"Flick and the Vanishing New Girl\" in the first Girl annual. He began to work for the Eagle in 1952, drawing the French Foreign Legion strip \"Luck of the Legion\", written by Geoffrey Bond, for nearly ten years, including spin-off strips in ABC Film Review in 1952. He also drew spy series \"Danger Unlimited\" and adaptations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World and C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower stories for the Eagle, and \"Arty and Crafty\", written by Geoffrey Bond, for Eagle's junior companion paper Swift. His work for comics displayed his talents in an exuberant and creative medium, working mainly from imagination. He joined Ladybird Books in 1963, and joined Harry Wingfield in illustrating many titles in its new Key Words Reading Scheme books, also known as Peter and Jane, which were used to teach so many British children to read. The consistency, naturalistic style and attention to detail of the artist made him a favourite with the prolific British publisher and over a period of a quarter of a century, he illustrated at least 100 different titles. Martin Aitchison was not the only artist to make the switch from The Eagle to Ladybird; Frank Hampson and Frank Humphris also followed the same path. He left Ladybird in 1987, and retired - apart from drawing a new comic strip, \"Justin Tyme - ye Hapless Highwayman\", written by Geoffrey Bond, and later his son Jim, for the fanzine Eagle Times from 1998 to 2004.

Her career in contemporary music began from her desire to help young composers of her generation get their compositions performed. Additionally, she enjoyed performing the music of established contemporary performers. She included these composers with the traditional repertoire in her performances. Ajemian was born in Manhattan on January 26, 1924. She began her music studies early at the Institute of Musical Art, which later merged with the Juilliard School. After graduating from the Lincoln School, Ajemian continued her education at the Juilliard School, studying violin with \u00c9douard Dethier and chamber music with Hans Letz and Felix Salmon, and played in the Juilliard orchestra under Albert Stoessel and Edgar Shenkman. In 1946, while still a student of \u00c9douard Dethier at the Juillard Graduate School of Music, Ajemian won the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation Award. In the same year, she made her debut at Town Hall and received the Distinguished Achievement Medal from Mademoiselle magazine as the Young Woman of the Year in Music. Among the many honors that have followed, the Order of St. James appointed her a Knight of Malta for her lifelong support of contemporary classical music. With her pianist sister Maro Ajemian, she performed in Europe, Canada and throughout the United States in a wide repertoire including works which were written for them by such distinguished composers as John Cage, Henry Cowell, Alan Hovhaness, Ernst Krenek, Lou Harrison, Wallingford Riegger, Carlos Surinach, and Ben Weber. Together and separately, the Ajemian sisters recorded extensively for Columbia, RCA Victor, MGM and Composers Records, Inc. They were the first musicians to receive the Laurel Leaf Award of the Composers Alliance for Distinguished Service to American Music. Ajemian and her sister were equally known for their interpretations of the standard classical repertoire. A unique feature of the many television programs they taped for NBC\u2019s Recital Hall and the National Educational Television Network was their series of programs comprising the complete cycle of all ten Beethoven Sonatas for Violin and Piano. They appeared as soloists under the batons of Dimitri Mitropoulos, Leopold Stokowski and Izler Solomon, and recorded with the latter two. Also during the 1940s, Ajemian co-founded the New York City-based organization Friends of Armenian Music Committee, which did much to launch the career of fellow Armenian-American composer Alan Hovhaness, via a series of well-received New York concerts of his music. These concerts were repeated in Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Ajemian and her husband, George Avakian, started Music for Moderns, a Town Hall, in 1957. In the mid-sixties, Ajemian and her fellow violinist Matthew Raimondi founded the Composers String Quartet at the suggestion of Gunther Schuller, which quickly earned an international reputation and toured in more than 26 countries, including the Soviet Union, India, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia and China. The Composers String Quartet recorded extensively for the Musical Heritage Society, Nonesuch Records, Composers Recordings, Inc. and Columbia Records among many others. The Quartet\u2019s 1970 recording of Elliott Carter\u2019s \"First and Second Quartets\" was honored by a Grammy nomination, received \u201cStereo Review\u2019s \u201cBest Chamber Music Recording of the Year\u201d Award, and was acclaimed by High Fidelity as \u201cBest Quartet of the Year\u201d and one of the \u201cFifty Greatest Albums of the Decade. \u201d Time magazine called it \u201can astonishingly brilliant and unique achievement. \u201d The Quartet was in residence at Columbia University in New York City and the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. For many years, they were the primary performers at the Mt Desert Festival of Chamber Music in Northeast Harbor, Maine. Ajemian was a long-time member of the Columbia University music faculty and served as a judge for several music organizations, including the annual Naumburg Foundation Awards. She was married to George Avakian, a record producer and founding officer of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. They had three children: Maro, Anahid and Gregory. \"Anahid Ajemian biography\". Archived from the original on December 23, 2007. Retrieved 2006-01-31.

She was active in many media formats in Japan including mainstream theatrical film, and was a popular blogger. Her adeptness at female ejaculation in adult videos (AV) earned Akane the title, \"Shiofuki Queen\". She retired from AV work in 2008. Hotaru Akane was born in Osaka, Japan on 25 October 1983. Akane's early appearances were under the stage name Anna Akizuki, and she debuted in AV using this name in an ensemble performance in the February 2004 adult video (AV) Faithful Dog 'Saseko', which won the award for Best AV Title at the 5th Takeshi Kitano Awards. By June 2004, she was appearing in solo videos such as Milky Sports for the Milky Prin studio. Later that year she was performing in featured actress videos for the major studios Wanz Factory and Moodyz. The November 2004 cosplay-themed Uniform Collection / Anna Akizuki had Akane donning a variety of school uniforms, a popular form of garment fetishism in Japanese AVs. In 2005, Weekly Playboy awarded Akane the \"Newcomer of the Year\" title in their \"AV Academy Awards\". and she also won a Best Actress Award for Excellence at the 2006 SOD Awards. Kuki's January 2006 release, Cutie Clips, gave the viewer the experience of having a \"virtual love story\" with several top AV actresses. Akane's segment is a \"virtual date\" at the beach. Akane performed in the September 2006 ensemble work Dream School 10 from Moodyz which took 2nd Place in the 2006 AV Open competition. She also took part in another multiple actress video, Special Galactic All-Stars, from Real Works which won a Special Prize at the same contest. Also in September 2006, Akane appeared in her first \"uncensored\" video, without the mosaic pixellation which is used to disguise the genitals in most Japanese porn films. She subsequently made four more original uncensored videos, all released by Sky High Entertainment. Akane also had a role in director Toru Ichikawa's mainstream action film, Sekiry\u016b no onna (\u8d64\u9f8d\u306e\u5973), (The Legend of Red Dragon) which was released to theaters in October 2006. For her ability to perform shiofuki or female ejaculation, Akane became known as the \"Shiofuki Queen\" of Japanese adult videos. Videos focusing on this talent include such titles as the December 2004 Hotaru Akane - Shiofuki Climax and Hotaru Akane - Paipan Mega Shiofuki Fuck from December 2007. Akane says that she prepares for her shiofuki demonstrations by drinking an entire bottle of water before performing in these scenes. In the June 2006 Hotaru Akane and Ayano Murasaki: Splash Heaven, the plot of the video has Akane competing with top jukujo or \"mature\" actress, Ayano Murasaki in this area of specialty in a contest to decide \"Who is the best squirter in the AV industry\". Love Splashing, released the following month, was a shiofuki-themed omnibus collection grouping Akane with such notable practitioners of the technique as Ai Kurosawa. In January 2007, Akane was chosen to be the actress in the inaugural entry of the new Ultimate Ecstasy series on the Real Works label. She appeared in three Interracial videos in early 2007; Bring It On Denma Black Dude in January, Gal Dancer Black Dude Nakadashi in February, and Black Group Fuck in March with two other AV idols. Akane has said that she takes pride in her career as an AV idol, and her January 2007 video, Gals' Battle Royal \uff5eHotaru Kurenai X Chihiro Shina\uff5e, makes a theme of that professionalism. The plot of the video has two accomplished AV performers trying to outdo each other in a competition of sexual acts. Practices employed in the contest include fellatio, paizuri and urination. The video was re-released in Blu-ray format in July. A similar competition-themed video was Versus, Hotaru Akane vs. Satoko Tachibana, which pitted Akane against another top AV idol in a competition over who is the most skilled erotic performer. Magic Mirror The Two-way Mirror Car; Hot Body In Yokohama follows the exploits of four AV idols, Akane and Hikari Hino among them, cruising the streets of Yokohama picking up amateur men with whom to frolic in a specially-equipped car. In Hotaru Akane and Misaki Aso Versus 40-Year-Old Virgins from September 2007, the fictional plot has Akane team with fellow AV idol Misaki Aso to give a group of sexually inexperienced males their first intimate encounters with the opposite sex. At the 2007 AV Open, Akane's June 2007 video Anal Splash Thick Lesbian United! for Cross with Chihiro Hara and Sakura Sakurada won First Place in the \"Challenge Stage\" section and also took the Lily Franky Honorary President Prize. Akane retired from AV activities in 2008 and released her retirement video Final Gusher - Akane Hotaru's Retirement Work with Cross in October 2008 but kept her blog open until August 2009. In an interview given after her retirement, Akane said that AV actresses were better treated by management when she began her career (in 2004) and were now being treated like commodities. Her advice to newcomers to the industry was to set goals and keep control of your own body. In November 2008, Akane played the role of a pretentious celebrity in director Kazunori Kitasaki's mainstream action thriller Triangle Connection (\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30b3\u30cd \uff5eTriangle Connection\uff5e). Earlier that year, she also acted in the TV Asahi television movie special Mission Section Chief Hitoshi Tadano Special '08 (\u7279\u547d\u4fc2\u9577 \u53ea\u91ce\u4ec1 \u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb'\uff10\uff18) broadcast in February 2008 and based on the manga and TV drama Tokumei Kakarich\u014d Tadano Hitoshi. In March 2008, Akane made her debut as a singer in a celebrity compilation CD titled Mero Raba (Melodic Lover) targeted at a female audience. She provided the lyrics for the song she sings: Ai no Kuni. Other contributors to the CD include fashion models and popular singer TSUKASA; Akane was the only AV actress included. She has also appeared irregularly on the popular gal fashion magazine Koakuma Ageha as a model. In December 2008 when the magazine's musical compilation album Koakuma Magic (\u5c0f\u60aa\u9b54magic) was released, she was featured with her vocal track Mikazuki (lit. \"crescent\") (\u4e09\u65e5\u6708). Unlike many other adult video actresses who carefully guard their private lives, Akane has kept a fairly high public profile. In addition to her AV appearances, Akane has become known as a popular blogger. Her frank blog, \"Hotaru's Life,\" quickly achieved a high blog-ranking, which it has continuously maintained. Akane also has an account on the Chinese Twitter-like site Sina Weibo and in September 2012, she created a stir with a posting addressing the Senkaku Islands dispute stating \"From a historical point of view, the Senkaku Islands belong to China. \" The response in China was overwhelmingly positive but Akane's agent later published a clarification saying that while Akane wished the dispute to be settled peacefully, it was her translator who had added the controversial line. As a high-profile celebrity in the sex industry, Akane was invited to speak at a World AIDS Day event in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward on 1 December 2007. When asked in an interview why she became involved in AIDS awareness, Akane said that she had been approached by a female student at Waseda University who asked for advice on sexual matters after a lecture that Akane had given there at an AIDS awareness event. This made her feel that she had a responsibility to young people who looked up to her as an actress, and as a result, she started working in public awareness programs to promote safe sex and HIV screening. She has also said that she was inspired by the example of Ai Iijima who devoted the last years of her life to AIDS prevention. Akane's efforts have extended outside Japan, she became a Red Ribbon Ambassador for the Taiwan AIDS Foundation and in December 2010 she traveled to Shanghai to start an AIDS prevention campaign \"Take Action\", which included passing out condoms to people in the street. She also donated 5000 condoms to a Shanghai organization dedicated to preventing sexually transmitted diseases. In June 2012, the Taiwan online news service NowNews ran an article on the Top Ten Japanese AV Idols from a Taiwanese perspective. Akane was listed as number one in their selection and her AIDS work in Taiwan was detailed. Akane and other Japanese AV stars (especially Sora Aoi) have a large popular following in China and Akane was invited as a guest to speak to a class on Sexology at Central China Normal University in Wuhan, China in March 2012. However, when thousands of students said online that they intended to attend the lecture, it was canceled because of security concerns. When Akane arrived in Wuhan on March 1, she gave her talk on local television instead of at the university. Akane was discovered collapsed at home on August 15, 2016. Suicide and foul play have been ruled out as causes. Shortly before she was found dead, her manager told that she had been suffering from severe cough prior to smoking cigarette. Her death are believed to be caused by suffocation stemming from an acute asthma attack. See Hotaru Akane filmography for adult videos (AV) by this actress.

At the time, he was reporting about the armed confrontation between Kurdish separatists and Turkish forces, which is part of the Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present). Rohat's mother spoke with JINHA and gave an insight to Rohat's life and character. Rohat was born in Istanbul in 1997. When Rohat was three years old, the 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake destroyed his home forcing his family to move back to their hometown, Suru\u00e7. In 2006, the Azadiya Welat began daily publication and Rohat met with Kurdish free press and began to distribute their papers. Years later he became chief and editor for the newspaper. His mother told interviewers that he did not like cruelty or oppression of different groups, it did not seem moral and scared him. Akta\u015f was working as a news editor for the Azadiya Welat in the southeastern Turkish town, Cizre. Akta\u015f was covering the protests, riots and military conflict in Cizre, it was one of the several areas where security forces were very heavily present. There were many groups of militants fighting for the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party or formerly known as PKK and this was causing the area to be extremely tense. Kurdish groups were claiming that many people had been burned in the same basement in Cizre. There was a 24-hour curfew installed for the town because of the danger that was present. After Rohat Akta\u015f took refuge in a basement but eventually became trapped with many others. He was able to make contact with his family two days after he had sustained the injury and told them about this situation. The Azadiya Welat newsroom was in contact with Aktas but lost communication with him. On February 4, the newsroom had been without communication from Rohat Aktas for five days. They reported the last conversation they had with Rohat he told them \"The state wants to execute us\"It was not until February 24 that Aktas's body had been identified using DNA testing to confirm his death. Aktas was among 8 others who were killed in the incident and found in the basement as well, 10-15 others were also wounded. Police have confirmed that more than 40 others have also died in the streets as a result of the violence. After the shooting occurred, some changes started showing up on Rohat Akta\u015f's Twitter account. His profile picture showed him sitting down with a rifle over his shoulder and chest. Akta\u015f's agency reported that he was not a fighter and was on an assignment to cover the fights in Cizre. Other allegations of Aktas being a fighter have surfaced, but none have been proven to be true. The newspaper Rohat was working for, \"Azadiya Wela\" has confirmed that he was in Cizre to cover the clashes for a story. Since his death, Rohat Akta\u015f's Twitter account has been suspended. This was part of the Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present). Kurdish nationalism aspires to separate from Turkey and create an independent area known as Kurdistan and is connected in purpose with other movements in bordering countries. In Cizre, these protests and riots became violent. The violent outbreaks and treatment of citizens have sparked investigations revolving around the Human Rights in Turkey. At the time of his wound, Rohat Aktas was reporting about the confrontation between Kurdish separatists and Turkish forces in Cizre. Another unnamed journalist was also injured in the same events that led to Aktas's death. Along with Aktas, 115 dead bodies have been removed from basements in the town of Cizre that came under attack by Turkish state forces. The government says more than 300 members of the security forces have died fighting Kurdish rebels since July. The curfew was not lifted on the town of Cizre for a few weeks after the situation arose because of leftover explosives the military was still working to clear and clean up. Locals of Cizre have spoke since the incident and said that the worst of the violence is over, but they are uncertain whether peace has been achieved yet. Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \"I condemn the killing of Rohat Akta\u015f. It is essential for freedom of expression and freedom of information that journalists be able to carry out their work without fear of death or violence. \"A statement from PEN International stated: \"Rohat Akta\u015f died while trying to tell the world about the plight of wounded civilians with little or no access to medical care in Cizre. Freedom of expression plays an invaluable role, particularly in times of conflict, to allow us to understand what is happening. We call on the Turkish authorities to conduct a swift, transparent and thorough investigation into the death of Rohat Akta\u015f and urge the government in Ankara to look for a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the conflict in southeast Turkey. \"Press Emblem Campaign was very worried about the deterioration of the freedom of the press in Turkey. Turkey was called upon to reverse its decision to seize the Zaman daily.

(1935 \u2013 March 4, 2016), was the President of Cordoba University in Ashburn, Virginia, United States. He also held the Imam Al-Shafi'i Chair in the Islamic Legal Theory at The Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences at Corboda University. Al-Alwani concentrated on the fields of Islamic legal theory, jurisprudence (fiqh), usul al-fiqh, Qur'anic sciences, and general Islamic thought. Al-Alwani was founder and former chairman of the Fiqh Council of North America. Born in 1935 in Iraq, Al-Alwani received his high school diploma from Al-Azhar in 1953 and received his bachelor's from the College of Shari\u2019ah and Law at al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt in 1959. He continued at the college and earned a master's degree in 1968 and a doctorate in Usul al-fiqh in 1973. Following his undergraduate studies, Al-Alwani returned to Iraq and became a lieutenant in the Iraqi Military Reserves. He taught in the Military Academy of Iraq in Baghdad and also taught in the College of Islamic Studies where he was a professor for 6 years. While in Baghdad Al-Alwani studied with some of Iraq's most prominent figures including: Sheikh Amjad al-Zahawi, Sheikh Qasim Al-Qaysi, (Grand Mufty of Iraq), Sheikh Mohammad Fu'ad Al-Aloosi, Sheikh Abdul 'Aziz Salem Al-Samerai, Sheikh Mohammed Al-Qazilchi. Al-Alwani led Jummah (Friday Prayers) in the famous Mosque of Hajja Haseebah Al-Pachatchi from 1953 until 1969. He was forced to leave Iraq in 1969 due to his opposition of the Ba'ath party. He returned to Al-Azhar in Egypt where he earned his PhD. After his PhD graduation he taught for 10 years at the Imam Muhammad ibn Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Al-Alwani then decided to immigrate to the United States in 1983 where he settled down in Northern Virginia for 23 years. There he studied the history of several religious groups, specifically Jewish history and focused his attention on Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakay, who established the famous Jewish school in Haifa and founded the jurisprudence for Jewish minorities across the globe. Al-Alwani learned many of his lessons on Muslim integration into American society from Rabbi Yohanan. Al-Alwani's open attitude towards education strengthened his benefit to the Islamic community in the United States. During his time in the United States and in the Middle East, he worked extensively on interfaith projects. He has a vast network of scholars from different religions whom he still keeps up with as friends today. Al-Alwani held the first chair for an Islamic scholar in the Washington Theological Consortium. Al-Alwani wrote and published over 30 books on a wide variety of Islamic issues including the \"Ethics of Disagreement\". He pioneered many revolutionary original thoughts and ideas that subsequently lead to the establishment of new fields in Islamic Studies. He wrote about the Islamization of Knowledge, the need for Ijtihad, and contributed to fiqh al-aqalliyyat (Muslim minority jurisprudence) which deals with problems Muslims face in countries where they are minorities and concentrates more on special and exceptional rulings for those special circumstances. Al-Alwani is known for his work in the disciplines in Quranic studies. In his book, \"Al-Tadabour\" (exegesis) he discusses how to understand the Quran using the Quran itself as opposed to the direct reliance on \"Mufassireen\" (Quranic interpreters). He believes that due to the diversity in background and studies of these \"mufassiroon\" they have brought their biases and differences amongst Muslims through their interpretations. By removing the \"middle man\" Alwani believes that Muslims can find a better understanding of the Quran and Islam. Al-Alwani has compared America to al-Andalus (Spain) where the Muslims risk deportation from America if they fail to become partners with other groups of society. They can achieve this by serving America and convincing American society that Islam and Muslims in America are an asset to society rather than a liability. His work reflected moderate positions in Islamic scholarship, including a monograph he wrote against punishing apostasy. Al-Alwani had 3 children, Dr. Zainab Alwani, Dr. Ruqaya Alwani and Ahmed Alwani all of whom are active in their fathers methodology. He still plays an active role in his late wife's Mona Abul-Fadl work on Muslim's Women Studies and promotes her book, \"Arab Regimes\". He founded a library and think-tank in Cairo named Zahra and Mona Rewaq. He is the main supporter of the Arab Association of Women and Civilization Studies which was established by Dr. Mona Abul-Fadl. He enjoys listening to maqaam Iraqi and classical Arabic music (especially Umm Kalthoom). Since he was a child, he has played the musical instrument 'Al-Qanoon' (similar to the piano).

She worked as a commercial photographer for magazines and NGOs and completed assignments on refugees. Her work was exhibited widely and is held in the collection of Qatar Museum. Alaoui died from injuries suffered in a terrorist attack in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Alaoui was born in Paris to a Moroccan father and a French mother, and grew up in Marrakesh, Morocco. During her childhood and adolescence, she was regularly exposed to tragic stories of migrants drowning at sea while undertaking hazardous journeys, which she interpreted as stories of social injustice. When Alaoui turned 18, she moved to New York City to study photography at the City University of New York. Alaoui felt that studying in the United States allowed her to become \"even more exposed to questions of belonging and identity construction. \" She returned to Morocco in 2008. Alaoui believed that photography and art could be used for social activism, and should be used for \"reflecting and questioning society\". As a result, she chose to focus her work on social and national realities of cultural identity and diversity, migration and displacement. To do this, she used image creation, reports and studio video installations. One of her commonly used techniques was to set up a portable studio in a public place such as a market square and to invite interested passers-by to be photographed. Alaoui stated that her inspiration for this type of portrait photography came from Robert Frank's portrayal of Americans in the post-war era, such as in The Americans (1958). Alaoui often emphasizes her subjects, minimizing the background of some of her portraits. Art critics described her work as \"post-Oriental\", referring to the theory of Orientalism proposed by Edward Said. Her photos were published in The New York Times and Vogue. She also completed assignments for the Spanish TV reality show El Mago. In 2013, she was commissioned by the Danish Refugee Council to create a series of portraits of refugees in Lebanon. The project was called \"Natreen\" (\"We Wait\"). In 2013, she created a video installation entitled \"Crossings\", describing the journeys of Moroccans travelling to Europe. In 2015, she completed a photographic assignment \"Everyday Heroes of Syria\", in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, focusing on Syrians living in refugee settlements. The project was completed for the Danish Refugee Council, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office and ActionAid. Alaoui was hired by UN Women and Amnesty International to work on a photographic assignment on women's rights in Burkina Faso. On January 16, 2016, during her first week working on the assignment, she was seriously wounded by gunshots while sitting in a parked car with her driver outside the Cappuccino cafe whilst gunmen attacked the Cappucino and the Splendid Hotel. Mahamadi Ou\u00e9draogo, the driver, sustained critical injuries and died in the vehicle. Alaoui was quickly taken to a hospital and seemed initially in a stable condition following an operation. She died three days later of a heart attack. Her remains were flown to Morocco at the expense of King Mohammed VI of Morocco. On her death, the director of the Maison europ\u00e9enne de la photographie and the president of Arab World Institute made a joint statement praising her work giving \"a voice to the voiceless\" and noting that she was \"one of the most promising photographers of her generation. \" The humanistic commitment displayed by Leila Alaoui throughout her life and work led after her passing to several tributes in Morocco, France and many other countries.

He was one of the few Chicano poets to have \"gained recognition while writing mostly in Spanish\" within the United States. His poems have been also translated into Irish and Swedish. He made many guest appearances at public schools so that he could help inspire and influence young people to write their own poetry especially because he felt that children are \"natural poets. \" Alarc\u00f3n was born in Wilmington, California and had four brothers and two sisters. He moved to Guadalajara, Mexico with his family when he was 6 and then moved back to California when he was eighteen. Alarc\u00f3n felt that he became a writer when he was fifteen and helped transcribe his grandmother's own ballad-like songs. His grandmother was a native speaker of Nahuatl. Growing up in both the United States and Mexico and experiencing both cultures helped shape the kind of writing he would create. As a young adult, he moved back to the Los Angeles area. He received his high school diploma from Cambria Adult School. He worked in restaurants and as a migrant farm worker. During this time, he went to East Los Angeles College. Alarc\u00f3n graduated from California State University, Long Beach, and Stanford University. During college, he started writing poetry, belonged to many literary circles in the area and also read his poetry out loud at various venues. At Stanford, between 1978 and 1980, he edited the journal Vortice. In 1982, while on a Fulbright Fellowship to Mexico City, Alarc\u00f3n discovered Aztec incantations translated by a Mexican priest . These later inspired the writing in Snake Poems: An Aztec Invocation. He also met his \"soul mate,\" Mexican poet, El\u00edas Nandino, on his trip to Mexico City. Alarc\u00f3n was very impressed with how Nandino refused to hide his homosexuality from the world. During his time in Mexico, Alarc\u00f3n was involved in the theatre in Mexico City and also did a lot of research at Colegio de M\u00e9xico. The Fulbright grant also allowed him to travel to Cuba. In 1984, Alarc\u00f3n was considered a suspect in the murder of a young man, Teddy Gomez, who was killed in Golden Gate Park. He was held in jail for some time during the investigation with his bail set at $500,000. The investigation itself was considered \"discriminatory. \" Alarc\u00f3n felt that if he had been white, he never would have been considered a suspect. Others questioned the police department's actions and felt that they were also homophobic. Legal defense funds were raised, with Margarita Luna Robles organizing and leading the cause. The number of people who came to Alarc\u00f3n's aid, visiting him in jail, speaking up on his behalf, praying for him showed how the Chicano community can come together during times of trouble. The actual murderer, William Melvin White, eventually confessed and Alarc\u00f3n was cleared of all charges. Later, Alarc\u00f3n sued the City of San Francisco because of the trauma the investigation caused. Alarc\u00f3n was said to age visibly because of the ordeal. His book, Tattoos, reflects his experience as being a murder suspect. Alarc\u00f3n and fellow poets Juan Pablo Gutierrez and Rodrigo Reyes founded Las Cuarto Espinas, the first gay Chicano poets collective, in 1985. Together, they published a collection of poetry titled Ya Vas Carnal. He taught at the University of California, Davis, and is the co-author of Mundo 21, a Spanish-language method published by Cengage Learning. Mundo 21 is considered the best Spanish textbook on the market. In response to a group of students chaining themselves to the Arizona State Capitol on April 20, 2010, to protest the anti-immigrant legislation Arizona SB 1070, Alarc\u00f3n penned the poem \"For the Capitol Nine\" and posted it to his Facebook page. Prompted by the response to this poem, he created a Facebook group called \"Poets Responding to SB 1070\", which grew to include over 1200 poems and received over 600,000 hits. An anthology of poems from the group is being prepared for publication. Alarc\u00f3n judged the 2012 Andr\u00e9s Montoya Poetry Prize. He lived in Davis, California. He died of cancer on 15 January 2016. Alarc\u00f3n wrote poetry in English, Spanish and Nahuatl, often presented to the reader in a bilingual format. His poetry is considered minimalist in style. Alarcon revised as necessary, cutting out anything he didn't feel added to the poem. His sparse style has at times caused his poetry to be overlooked by critics who view his simplicity as not worthy of commentary. However, his choices of words, short lines and stanzas were very deliberate. Alarcon did not plan his subject matter out in advance and did not write with a firm plan in mind. Instead, he allowed his poetry to form in an organic sense, where the poem grows naturally from his own feelings. His lyrical voice is said to move between \"affirmation and self-erasure. \" He also thought that poetry is best read aloud. He did not use periods in his writing because he felt his poems were an extension of his life and a period would indicate the end, or his death. He said he tends to write his poetry on secretarial style, yellow blocks of paper by hand. Alarc\u00f3n's work from its earliest roots has been influenced by Aztec incantations and culture. Connection to his culture and language, both Spanish and English were important to him. Being able to speak more than one language was important to him and something he tried to impart to children and their caregivers. He saw language as \"crucial for individual identity. \" Alarc\u00f3n attempted to write his poetry in a bilingual fashion, but did not feel all concepts translate properly. Sometimes, the words he chose depended on language-specific concepts, such as gendered words in Spanish, which Alarc\u00f3n played with in his poetry. Alarc\u00f3n was \"highly-regarded\" for his children's poetry. He started writing poetry for children in 1997 when he realized there where very few books for children written by Latino poets. It took him a few years to sell a publisher on the idea of bilingual poems for children, because publishers didn't think they would sell very well in the United States. Kirkus Reviews has called his work on the children's book, Animal Poems of the Iguazu, as \"eloquently crafted. \" He has been praised for his depictions of Latino culture in his poetry for children. His children's poetry reflects a \"genuine warmth and sense of play. \" Much of it is autobiographical, touching on his memories of his own childhood in such a way that helps children connect to their own family experiences. His descriptions of food are another universal theme that all children can relate to. His poetry for adults is more nuanced and deals with issues involving same-sex relationships, violence and literary references. His poems have also been described as erotic and socially conscious. Alarc\u00f3n is very careful to construct a sense of meaning and feeling in his poetry that expresses his experiences relating to homosexual desire. Snake Poems: An Aztec Invocation and De amor oscuro/Of Dark Love were poems that put him among \"the strongest voices in contemporary Chicano poetry. \" De amor oscuro/Of Dark Love is an especially important collection because it attempts to \"end the silence on Chicano male homosexuality. \" It is also considered the first collection of Mexican-American poetry \"wholly dedicated to the emotion of love. \"He also wrote some short stories. 1981 Ruben Dario Prize for poetry. 1984 Chicano Literary Prize for poetry. 1993 American Book Award 1993 PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Award 1997 Pura Belpr\u00e9 Honor Award by the American Library Association 1998 Carlos Pellicer-Robert Frost Poetry Honor Award by the Third Binational Border Poetry Contest, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua. 2002 Pura Belpr\u00e9 Honor Award, Danforth and Fulbright fellowships 2002 Fred Cody Lifetime Achievement Award from the Bay Area Book Reviewers Association (BABRA) Tattoos, Oakland: Nomad Press, 1985 Ya Vas, Carnal, San Francisco 1985 Loma Prieta, Santa Cruz: We Press 1990 Body in Flames/Cuerpo en llamas, San Francisco: Chronicle Books 1990 De amor oscuro/Of Dark Love, Santa Cruz: Moving Parts Press 1991 Cuerpo en llamas/Kropp i l\u00e5gor, Lysekil, Sweden: Fabians F\u00f6rlag 1991 Cuerpo en llamas / Colainn ar bharr lasrach, Indreabh\u00e1n, Ireland:Cl\u00f3 Iar-Connachta Teo 1992 Poemas zurdos, Mexico City: Editorial Factor 1992 Snake Poems: An Aztec Invocation.

Alaskey was one of Mel Blanc's successors at the Warner Bros. Animation studio until his death. He alternated with Jeff Bergman and Greg Burson in voicing Warner Bros. cartoon characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Sylvester, Tweety, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew, Marvin the Martian, Speedy Gonzales, Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, and Taz, among many others. He also voiced Plucky Duck on Tiny Toon Adventures from 1990 to 1995. Alaskey was the second actor to voice Grandpa Lou Pickles on the Nickelodeon cartoon Rugrats (inheriting the role after David Doyle's death in 1997). He voiced Lou again in the Rugrats spin-off series All Grown Up!, as well as the Rugrats film trilogy. He also voiced Uncle Stinkie in Casper, as well as the film's 1996 animated spin-off The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper. Alaskey was born in Troy, New York on April 17, 1952. At age 3, he was looking for a pair of sunglasses or people's cigar butts so that he could portray different characters. Alaskey was interested in archeology at the age of ten. After archeology, he was interested in becoming a priest and an English teacher. Alaskey moved to New York City in the 1970s. While initially in New York City, he worked in insurance while the acting was getting started. Alaskey was occasionally seen onscreen impersonating Jackie Gleason, with whom he shared a physical resemblance. In the 1980s, Gleason personally chose Alaskey to re-record selected dialogue from the \"lost episodes\" of The Honeymooners found in Gleason's private collection. After Gleason died in 1987, the project was shelved. In 1985, Alaskey provided various voices for Galtar and the Golden Lance. Alaskey was in several television shows including Night Court, Head of the Class, Back to the Future, and Spitting Image: The 1987 Movie Awards. His first major film was Who Framed Roger Rabbit as Yosemite Sam. Alaskey provided a vocal Gleason impersonation in the \"Mighty's Wedlock Whimsy\" episode of Bakshi-Hyde Ventures' Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures in 1988, and a Cary Grant impersonation in \"The Bride of Mighty Mouse\" episode from the same season. Although best known for his ability to successfully impersonate Looney Tunes characters, Alaskey did voice work for non-Warner Bros. characters as well. He has voiced Grandpa Lou Pickles on Rugrats (inheriting the role after David Doyle's death in 1997). He voiced Lou again in the Rugrats spin-off series, All Grown Up!, as well as the Rugrats film trilogy. He also created the voice of Thomas Timberwolf for the internet series TimberWolf, created by animation legend Chuck Jones. He was heard briefly as a voice-over announcer for the Toon Disney channel (and sometimes Dcom extras on Disney Channel). He was the voice of Curt Connors in the Spider-Man 2 video game and Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man: Friend or Foe. Alaskey was in the independent film The Legend of Sasquatch and voiced Mermaid Man in the video games SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants! and SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab. He voiced Stinkie in Casper as well as that film's 1996 animated spin-off, The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper. Alaskey played Beano Froelich in Out of This World but left the show early in its final season, making only infrequent appearances in a few episodes. In the 1980s, he worked as the original announcer on the short-lived game show Couch Potatoes, hosted by Marc Summers. Alaskey made several onscreen appearances, portraying the show's \"next door neighbor\". For the show's final weeks, he was replaced by Jim McKrell and the \"next door neighbor\" concept was dropped. During this time, he was also a panelist on The New Hollywood Squares, hosted by John Davidson. In 2008, Alaskey participated in a unique interview conducted by Logan Leistikow and released by TheYellowMic. com. He answered questions and told his story, then went out onto Hollywood Boulevard and talked to people on the street who wanted to hear his famous voices. This was the first time Alaskey had performed in public in this manner. In 2003, he took over the roles of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck in the film Looney Tunes: Back in Action. He also, at times, provided the voices for Sylvester, Tweety, and other Looney Tunes characters. Alaskey was the primary voice for Plucky Duck on Tiny Toon Adventures. In 2014, Alaskey started narrating the television documentary series Murder Comes to Town, which airs on the Investigation Discovery Network. Alaskey's only live-action leading role in a film was as lovelorn Ron Douglas in the black comedy Lucky Stiff, directed by Anthony Perkins and co-starring Donna Dixon and Jeff Kober. Alaskey died in Green Island, New York, from cancer on February 3, 2016 at age 63.

Alban was drafted in the ninth round of the 1952 NFL Draft and started all 12 games for the Redskins his rookie year. His best season came in 1954, where he finished second in the league in interceptions with nine and was selected to his only Pro Bowl. He was traded to the Steelers in 1956 and retired after the 1959 campaign. Alban was born in Hanover, Pennsylvania, and attended La Porte High School in La Porte, Indiana, where he graduated in 1948.

(1962), and A Delicate Balance (1966). Three of his plays won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and two of his other works won the Tony Award for Best Play. His works are often considered as frank examinations of the modern condition. His early works reflect a mastery and Americanization of the Theatre of the Absurd that found its peak in works by European playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, and Jean Genet. His middle period comprised plays that explored the psychology of maturing, marriage, and sexual relationships. Younger American playwrights, such as Paula Vogel, credit Albee's daring mix of theatricality and biting dialogue with helping to reinvent the post-war American theatre in the early 1960s. Later in his life, Albee continued to experiment in works such as The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? (2002). Edward Albee was born in 1928. He was placed for adoption two weeks later and taken to Larchmont, New York, where he grew up. Albee's adoptive father, Reed A. Albee, the wealthy son of vaudeville magnate Edward Franklin Albee II, owned several theaters. His adoptive mother, Reed's third wife, Frances (Cotter), was a socialite. He later based the main character of his 1991 play Three Tall Women on his mother, with whom he had a conflicted relationship. Albee attended the Rye Country Day School, then the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, from which he was expelled. He then was sent to Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, where he was dismissed in less than a year. He enrolled at The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, graduating in 1946. He had attracted theatre attention by having scripted and published nine poems, eleven short stories, essays, a long act play named Schism and a 500 page novel, The Flesh of Unbelievers (Horn, 1) in 1946. His formal education continued at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was expelled in 1947 for skipping classes and refusing to attend compulsory chapel. Albee left home for good when he was in his late teens. In a later interview, he said: \"I never felt comfortable with the adoptive parents. I don't think they knew how to be parents. I probably didn't know how to be a son, either. \" In a 1994 interview, he stated that he left home at the age of 18 because \"[he] had to get out of that stultifying, suffocating environment. \" In a 2008 interview, he told interviewer Charlie Rose that he was \"thrown out\" because his parents wanted him to become a \"corporate thug\" and did not approve of his aspirations to become a writer. Albee moved into New York's Greenwich Village, where he supported himself with odd jobs while learning to write plays. Primarily in his early plays, Albee's work had various representations of the LGBTQIA community often challenging the image of a heterosexual marriage. Despite challenging society's views about the gay community, he did not view himself as an LGBT advocate. Albee's work typically criticized the American dream. His first play, The Zoo Story, which was written in three weeks, was first staged in Berlin in 1959 before eventually premiering Off-Broadway in 1960. His next play, The Death of Bessie Smith, similarly premiered in Berlin before arriving in New York. Albee's most iconic play, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, opened on Broadway at the Billy Rose Theatre on October 13, 1962, and closed on May 16, 1964, after five previews and 664 performances. The controversial play won the Tony Award for Best Play in 1963 and was selected for the 1963 Pulitzer Prize by the award's drama jury, but was overruled by the advisory committee, which elected not to give a drama award at all. The two members of the jury, John Mason Brown and John Gassner, subsequently resigned in protest. An Academy Award-winning film adaptation of the controversial play was released in 1966 starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". According to The New York Times, Albee was \"widely considered to be the foremost American playwright of his generation. \"The less-than-diligent student later dedicated much of his time to promoting American university theatre. Most recently, he served as a distinguished professor at the University of Houston, where he taught playwriting. His plays are published by Dramatists Play Service and Samuel French, Inc. A member of the Dramatists Guild Council, Albee received three Pulitzer Prizes for drama\u2014for A Delicate Balance (1967), Seascape (1975), and Three Tall Women (1994). Albee was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1972. In 1985, Albee was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame. In 1999, Albee received the PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award as a Master American Dramatist. He received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement (2005); the Gold Medal in Drama from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1980); as well as the Kennedy Center Honors and the National Medal of Arts (both in 1996). In 2009, Albee received honorary degree from the Bulgarian National Academy of Theater and Film Arts (NATFA), a member of the Global Alliance of Theater Schools. In 2008, in celebration of Albee's 80th birthday, a number of his plays were mounted in distinguished Off-Broadway venues, including the historic Cherry Lane Theatre where the playwright directed two of his early one-acts, The American Dream and The Sandbox. Albee established the Edward F. Albee Foundation, Inc. in 1967, from royalties from his play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. The foundation funds the William Flanagan Memorial Creative Persons Center (named after the composer William Flanagan, but better known as \"The Barn\") in Montauk, New York, as a residence for writers and visual artists. The foundation's mission is \"to serve writers and visual artists from all walks of life, by providing time and space in which to work without disturbance. \" Albee was openly gay and stated that he first knew he was gay at age 12 and a half. Albee was briefly engaged to Larchmont debutante Delphine Weissinger, and although their relationship ended when she moved to England, he remained a close friend of the Weissinger family. Growing up, he often spent more of his time in the Weissinger household than he did in his own, due to discord with his adoptive parents. Albee insisted that he did not want to be known as a \"gay writer,\" saying in his acceptance speech for the 2011 Lambda Literary Foundation's Pioneer Award for Lifetime Achievement: \"A writer who happens to be gay or lesbian must be able to transcend self. I am not a gay writer. I am a writer who happens to be gay. \" His longtime partner, Jonathan Richard Thomas, a sculptor, died on May 2, 2005 from bladder cancer. They had been partners from 1971 until Thomas's death. Albee also had a relationship of several years with playwright Terrence McNally during the 1950s. Albee died at his home in Montauk, New York on September 16, 2016, aged 88. He had lived in Tribeca.

His work contributed to the elevation of snapshot-style portraits to the canon of American photography. Later in his life, Albertine focused on depictions of Louisiana's flora, documenting oaks, cypresses, swamp scenes and decaying plants. A lifelong experimenter, he often enhanced his images with the split tone technique. Richard Albertine was born in Norwich, Connecticut in 1944. He started photographing as a teenager and won his first cash prize in a photography contest organized by The Hartford Times newspaper in Connecticut. He entered Ambrose Street Kids (1963), a portrait of three homeless children from the streets of Rochester, New York After serving in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, Albertine returned to New England. During the 1970s, his work focused on capturing his family in spontaneous moments. Experimenting with elements available at home, he sought to elevate his everyday life through composition. Lisa (1971) the portrait of his infant daughter behind a screen, and Kelly (1971) a portrait of his son under the window, are examples of this effort. In 1974 these photographs were published in The Snapshot, a volume edited by Jonathan Green and published by Aperture that sought to highlight artists working with unposed snapshot photography. At the same time, Albertine continued to invest in his formal education. He enrolled in the Rochester Institute of Technology photography program, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1970. He then went to graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied under Minor White. Last Shooting Trip with Minor White (1971) is a testament to their relationship. In 1978, Albertine moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and worked for Gris Gris, a local magazine. He photographed personalities such as singer Irma Thomas and governor Edwin Edwards. In November of that year he authored an article commenting on his practice. Albertine published three photographs of his children, explaining that a deep sense of spirituality permeated his photographs, and that while his primary medium was light, his relationships informed his practice just as much. During the late 1980s Albertine turned his subject to the flora of Louisiana. His depictions of Avery Island, a nature reserve near the Louisiana coast, became a feature of his oeuvre. Exhibitions of this period focused on views of live oaks and palms endemic of the island, as well as flora in the banks of the Mississippi River and other wild areas. Albertine secured an Artist Sponsorship deal with Polaroid during the early 1990s, in which the company provided photographers with supplies in exchange for regular exhibitions to showcase their equipment. Albertine's Polaroid Portraits series returned the subject matter to snapshots of his social life. He experimented with alternative light sources and movement, frequently combining camera flash with the \u2018bulb\u2019 shutter setting of his Polaroid 110A. The result is an array of dynamic compositions that are full of energy and movement. These photographs were exhibited in a one-man show in Baton Rouge, LA. In 1996 his work was featured alongside A. J. Meek and a dozen others in Susan Sipple Elliot's book The South by its Photographers. Richard Albertine died in March 2016.

Aldred was born in East Melbourne, Victoria, on 1 August 1945. He was educated at Melbourne High School and Monash University, and held the degrees of Bachelor of Economics and Master of Administration from Monash University. During 1970\u201371 he was Special Projects Officer in the Commonwealth Public Service Board in Melbourne. This was followed by two years in the period 1971\u201373, as Management Training Officer at the Administrative College of Papua New Guinea. Though principally based in Port Moresby, Aldred also had responsibility for running management courses in several of PNG\u2019s major regional centres. In June 1973 Aldred returned to the Commonwealth Public Service Board in Melbourne as Industrial Information Officer. Later that year he was appointed Senior Industry Survey Officer in the Commonwealth Industries Assistance Commission, also in Melbourne. He remained there until elected to Federal Parliament in December 1975 as the Member for Henty. From 1965 to 1971, Aldred served in the Australian Army Reserve. His first four years were in the Melbourne University Regiment (MUR) and the last two years as a lieutenant and platoon commander in the newly formed Monash University Regiment (Mon UR). He was also Assistant Adjutant of Mon UR, and founded and edited the joint regimental publication, The Military Review. Aldred had a three-month attachment to the Australian Regular Army over the summer of 1968\u201369, as a sergeant instructor in 1 Recruit Training Battalion (1RTB) at Kapooka in New South Wales. Upon election as federal member for Henty in the Australian House of Representatives in the Liberal landslide of 13 December 1975, Aldred assumed a very active role in Coalition and Parliamentary Committees. He chaired the Government Members' Small Business Committee, working closely with the Industry Minister, the late Sir Phillip Lynch, on small business policy formulation. As Chairman of the Government Members' Worker Participation Committee, Aldred produced the first definitive set of proposals for a Coalition worker participation policy, to then prime minister, Malcolm Fraser. Many of the proposals were incorporated in a worker participation policy later announced by the productivity minister, Ian McPhee. Aldred was an active member of the newly established Expenditure Committee of the House of Representatives and as Chairman of the Government Members' Trade Sub-Committee, worked closely with the Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister, Doug Anthony. Defeated in October 1980, by the later House Speaker, Joan Child, Ken Aldred returned to the training profession. In early 1981 he took up the position of Manpower Development Executive with the Victorian Dairy Processing Industry Training Committee (VDPITC), operating under the auspices of the Australian Dairy Cooperation (ADC). In this capacity he spent over two years setting up training courses and training manuals for Victoria's dairy industry factories. He spent a considerable amount of time visiting factories in the state's three dairying regions, namely Gippsland, the Western District and the Northern Region. Ken Aldred left VDPITC on re-election to the federal parliament in May 1983. He re-entered the House of Representatives through the by-election in Bruce, which followed the resignation of House Speaker, the Sir Billy Snedden, after the Coalition defeat in the 1983 federal election. During his time as the MHR for Bruce, Aldred took a prominent role on defence and economic issues, as chair of the Opposition Defence Committee and the Opposition Treasury Committee. In 1985, he was elected by the Liberal Party to represent Australia at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, as the Opposition Parliamentary Adviser to the Australian Mission. At the UN, he became involved in committee work on the international drug trade and on Antarctica. Shortly afterwards in 1986\u201387 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. Following an electoral re-distribution he was elected to represent Deakin in the 1990 federal election and remained there until the 1996 election, when he lost pre-selection to his successor, Phil Barresi. Throughout his six years as member for Deakin, Aldred was a most active Liberal member on the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts, spearheading the inquiries into business migration and the Australian Taxation Office. The Charter of Taxpayers' Rights and other reforms to Tax Office administration were largely attributed to him. As a result of these inquiries, abuses of the Business Migration Programme were eliminated and significant reforms were made to Tax Office administration, including the introduction of the Charter of Taxpayer's Rights. At this time he was also Chairman of the Opposition Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Committee. During the 1980s, Aldred successfully advocated for the immigration to Australia of a large group of Jewish refusniks from Russia, when they had been refused admission by the federal Labor government. Several went on to professional success in Australia, including one who established a network of dental clinics and others who distinguished themselves in medicine and science. Aldred was disendorsed by the Liberal Party for Deakin in 1995 for the 1996 federal election and subsequently used parliamentary privilege to make allegations of involvement in espionage and drug trafficking against a prominent Jewish lawyer and a senior foreign affairs official, using documents that were later found to be forged, which had been supplied to him by LaRouche movement front organisation the Citizens Electoral Council. He also alleged that the Department of Foreign Affairs had twenty child sexual abusers employed in senior positions, and named senior diplomat John Holloway, who was charged and later acquitted. Aldred was a regular writer on policy issues for magazines and newspapers. Additionally he was co-editor and contributor to three books. The first, The Heart of Liberalism, was produced in 1994 with fellow Liberal MPs Kevin Andrews and Paul Filing. It presented a pragmatic and centrist philosophy and set of policies for the Liberal Party. After leaving federal parliament in 1996, Aldred was President and later Chairman of the Society of Australian Industry and Employment (SAIE) 2001\u201308, during which he devoted much time and energy to promoting the interests of Australian industry. This included editing and contributing to two books on industry policy, Rekindling the Flame in 2000, and Getting on Track in 2004. From December 1996 until his death, Aldred was the proprietor of one of Australia\u2019s major equestrian centres, the Victorian Equestrian Centre (VEC) in Upper Beaconsfield. The VEC offers children's riding clubs, school holiday camps, riding lessons, trail rides, specialised training programs and agistment. The VEC also founded the concept of Interschool Equestrian Challenges, with four of them being run each year. Aldred died unexpectedly on 17 April 2016 and is survived by his four children.

She was best known to television viewers for her long running role of Hilda Ogden in the soap opera Coronation Street, a role she played from 1964 until 1987, and also as Auntie Wainwright in the long-running sitcom Last of the Summer Wine from 1988 to 2010. For her role in Coronation Street, she won the 1985 Royal Television Society Award for Best Performance, and received a 1988 BAFTA TV Award nomination for Best Actress. Alexander was born at 18 Rhiwlas Street Toxteth, Liverpool, in 1926, to Nell and Archie Hodgkinson; her father worked as an electrician and the family lived in a terraced house with no indoor lavatory. Alexander had an elder brother, Kenneth. She aspired to become an actress from an early age, and later said that she was inspired by variety acts she saw at the Pavilion theatre in her home city. She attended St Edmund's College for Girls in Princes Park, Toxteth and as a teenager, she joined an amateur theatre group and took elocution lessons. Alexander spent five years as a library assistant in Liverpool before she began her acting career in 1949 at the Adelphi Guild Theatre in Macclesfield. She first appeared as Florrie in Sheppey by Somerset Maugham. She later worked in rep in Oldham, Stockport and York. Most of her parts were minor, and she also worked as a wardrobe mistress and stage manager. Her television debut is variously given as in the police series Z-Cars (1962) or in Deadline Midnight (1961). Alexander first appeared in Coronation Street in 1962 in a minor role as a landlady. Two years later, she returned to the programme as Hilda Ogden. She started playing the role on 8 July 1964, finally leaving on 25 December 1987. Ogden became highly popular with viewers and Alexander was often identified with her character. In the 40 Years on Coronation Street special, she recounted an incident that had happened years previously: while she was shopping, a fan asked if she was Hilda. She responded in her normal accent, \"I beg your pardon?\" Taken aback, the fan said, \"Oh, don't you talk funny!\"The British League for Hilda Ogden was established in 1979 by Sir John Betjeman, Willis Hall, Russell Harty, Laurence Olivier and Michael Parkinson, among others. In 1984, hundreds of fans sent her condolence cards after the death of her on-screen husband Stan Ogden, played by Bernard Youens, who had died a few months before his character was killed off. In 1985 she received the Royal Television Society Award for her performance on Coronation Street. When she decided to leave the show in 1987, fans started \"Save Hilda!\" campaigns; however, many did not realise that she had made her own decision to depart.

Until 1970, he was mainly concerned with fish, investigating the mechanics of swim bladders, tails and fish jaw mechanisms. Subsequently, he concentrated on the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion, notably walking and running in mammals, particularly on gait selection and its relationship to anatomy and to the structural design of skeletons and muscles. Born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Alexander was educated at Tonbridge School, Trinity Hall, Cambridge (MA, PhD) and the University of Wales (DSc). His PhD research was supervised by James Gray. After holding a lectureship at University College of North Wales from 1958 to 1969, he was Professor of Zoology at the University of Leeds from 1969 until his retirement in 1999, when the title of emeritus professor was conferred upon him. Alexander was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1992\u20131999) which included supervising the management of London and Whipsnade Zoos. He was president of the Society for Experimental Biology (1995\u20131997), President of the International Society of Vertebrate Morphologists (1997\u20132001) and editor of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B (1998\u20132004). Alexander specialised in research on animal mechanics and published numerous books and research papers in the field from 1959. Alexander was particularly interested in the mechanics of dinosaur motion. He developed a formula to calculate the speed of motion of dinosaurs, the so-called 'dinosaur speed calculator,' mathematically derived from the Froude number: \"The key to deriving estimates of dinosaur gait and speed from trackways was provided by the zoologist R. McNeill Alexander (1976). From observations of modern animals he derived a general relationship between an animal's speed of locomotion (v) and its hip height (h) and its stride length (SL), which is v = 0. 25. g 0. 5 . S L 1. 67 . h \u2212 1. 17 {\\displaystyle {v}=0. 25. {g^{0. 5}}. {SL^{1. 67}}. {h^{-1. 17}}} Alexander also pointed out that this formula could be applied to dinosaur trackways since the stride length can be measured directly and the hip height could be estimated from the size of the foot print. \"Originally, Alexander stated: \"I have now obtained a relationship between speed, stride length and body size from observations of living animals and applied this to dinosaurs to achieve estimates of their speeds. The estimated speeds are rather low\u2014between 1. 0 and 3. 6 ms\u22121. \"Modifications to the original formula gave rise to revised estimates, and \"Alexander (1996) argued that based on the bone dimensions of Tyrannosaurus it is unlikely they could have travelled at more than 8ms\u22121. \" Several calculations using variants of the formula indicate that dinosaurs probably travelled at around 3 ms\u22121 with a top speed of 8 ms\u22121. This translates to a speed range of roughly 6\u201320 mph.

He was a former director of Islami Bank, and chairman of the Diganta Media Corporation, which owns Diganta TV. He founded the Ibn Sina Trust and was a key figure in the establishment of the NGO Rabita al-Alam al-Islami. He was considered to be the wealthiest member of the Bangladeshi political party Jamaat-e-Islami. He was sentenced to death on 2 November 2014 for crimes against humanity committed during the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 by International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh. The charges were denied by his relatives, stating they were politically motivated. Rights groups also raised concerns about these cases, with Amnesty International criticising the use of the death penalty and saying Mir Quasem Ali's trial had been unfair. He was hanged at Gazipur on 3 September 2016 after his final appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Mir Quasem Ali is born to Mir Tayeb Ali and Rabeya Begum. He was born in Munsidangi Sutalori in Manikganj on 31 December 1952. He joined the Islami Chhatra Sangha in 1967 while studying in Chittagong Collegiate School. Mir Quasem Ali was a former director of Islami Bank, and chairman of the Diganta Media Corporation, which owns Diganta TV. He founded the Ibn Sina Trust and was a key figure in the establishment of the NGO Rabita al-Alam al-Islami. He was the chairman of Keari Ltd, Association of Multipurpose Welfare Agencies of Bangladesh and Agro Industrial Trust, director of marketing of Ibn Sina Pharmaceutical Industries, member secretary of Fouad Al-Khateeb Charity Foundation. He was part of management in Industrialists and Businessmen Welfare Foundation, Allama Iqbal Sangsad, International Islamic University Chittagong, Darul Ihsan University, Centre for Strategy and Peace Studies. Mir Quasem was a first-year student of Chittagong College in 1971, where he was pursuing a bachelor's degree in physics. He was the president of Chittagong Chhatra Sangha's unit. He was elected a to the Pakistan Islami Chhatra Sangha's provincial working council on 6 November. He was also general secretary of East Pakistan Islami Chhatra Sangha. Al-Badr was a paramilitary force composed of Jamaat e Islami's then student wing Islami Chhatra Sangha to support Pakistan army and crackdown on pro liberation groups. Al-Badr branch of Chittagong seized Mohamaya Bhaban building at Andrrkilla. The building was owned by a local Hindu family. They renamed it \"Dalim Hotel\" and used it as an interrogation and detention centre. Pro- Bangladeshi activists Jahangir Alam Chowdhury and Syed Md Emran testified at Quasem's trial that the prison was used to torture suspected members of Mukti Bahini; Mukti Bahini members \"Jasim\", Tuntu Sen and Ranjit Das were killed at this place. Witnesses testified at the trial that guards at hotel Dalim would announce the arrival of Quasem with \"Mr Quasem has come. Mr Commander has come. \" After independence Quasem fled to Saudi Arabia. He returned to Bangladesh and became the founding president of Islami Chhatra Shibir, the Jamaat's student front, on 6 February 1977. The organisation is a successor to the Islami Chhatra Sangha. Out of the 14 charges, Quasem was convicted in 10 charges in the trial at International Crimes Tribunal and he was awarded death sentence for two of the charges including murder and kidnapping. After the announcement of the verdict of the trial the lawyers from the defence said that justice had not been done on Quasem and he did not get proper judgment. Gonojagoron Moncho supported the verdict and expressed satisfaction. The defence pledged an appeal to Bangladesh High court. Quasem's political Party Jamaat-e-Islami called for a nationwide three days strike as a protest over the verdict. He filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The supreme court rejected the review petition on 30 August 2016, and Ali refused to seek clemency. In 2010, Just after formation of International Crimes Tribunal, Quasem signed 25 million US dollar deal with most influential US lobby firm Cassidy & Associates to influence US government to foil the war crimes trial process. In 2011 Quasem and his brother Mir Masum Ali again hired the same firm for the same purpose and paid $310,000 and that was the largest quantity paid by any client in the first quarter of 2011. Not only that, in 2014 sympathizer groups from USA again signed contract with Cassidy & Associates to lobby for the same cause and promised to pay $50,000. Later Cassidy & Associates sub-contracted the task to another 2 firms named Cloakroom Advisors and Kgloba. Beside this, another pro-Jamaat-e-islami organization appointed another lobbying firm named 'Just Consulting LLC' which was later renamed 'Grieboski Global Strategies' to influence the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, the US Department of State and the US Congress against the war crimes trials. Some critics of the current Bangladeshi Government said that Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of the country used the trials to target her political enemies. In 2016, Human Rights Watch reported that Mir Quasem Ali's trial was flawed. It demanded a moratorium on the death penalty, after details emerged that the prosecution had for producing insufficient evidence in court. Brad Adams of HRW stated: \"Allowing the death sentence in a case with such fundamental doubts about the evidence is unthinkable. \"Amnesty International raised serious concerns about the court proceedings. These include denying defence lawyers adequate time to prepare their cases, and arbitrarily limiting the number of witnesses they could call on. It urged the Bangladeshi government to annul the death sentence against Mir Quasem Ali and grant him a retrial, noting how the proceedings had reportedly been marred\" by irregularities. Amnesty spokeswoman Champa Patel said: The people of Bangladesh deserve justice for crimes committed during the War of Independence. The continued use of the death penalty will not achieve this. It only serves to inflame domestic tensions and further divide a society riven by violence. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also alleged that Mir Quasem Ali's son, Ahmed Bin Quasem, was arrested on 9 August 2016 and has since disappeared. Amnesty says multiple credible sources place him at Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) headquarters in Dhaka on 12 August, but authorities have denied having him in custody. Mir Quasem Ali was hanged at Kashimpur prison in Gazipur on 3 September 2016. There were reports of street celebrations held in Dhaka and Chittagong after the news of Ali's execution was broadcast live on television. "}, {"text": "Muhammad Ali (; born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. ; January 17, 1942 \u2013 June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer, activist, and philanthropist. Nicknamed \"The Greatest,\" he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century and as one of the greatest boxers of all time. Ali was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics, and turned professional later that year. He converted to Islam and became a Muslim after 1961, and eventually took the name Muhammad Ali. He won the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset at age 22 in 1964. In 1966, Ali refused to be drafted into the military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War. He was arrested, found guilty of draft evasion, and stripped of his boxing titles. He appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which overturned his conviction in 1971, but he had not fought for nearly four years and lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. His actions as a conscientious objector to the war made him an icon for the larger counterculture generation, and he was a high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement. As a Muslim, Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam (NOI). He later disavowed the NOI, adhering to Sunni Islam, and supporting racial integration like his former mentor Malcolm X. Ali was a leading heavyweight boxer of the 20th century, and he remains the only three-time lineal champion of that division. His joint records of beating 21 boxers for the world heavyweight title and winning 14 unified title bouts stood for 35 years. Ali is the only boxer to be named The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year six times. He has been ranked the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, and as the greatest athlete of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated, the Sports Personality of the Century by the BBC, and the third greatest athlete of the 20th century by ESPN SportsCentury. He was involved in several historic boxing matches and feuds, most notably his fights with Joe Frazier, such as the Thrilla in Manila, and his fight with George Foreman known as The Rumble in the Jungle which has been called \"arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century\" and was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide, becoming the world's most-watched live television broadcast at the time. Ali thrived in the spotlight at a time when many fighters let their managers do the talking, and he was often provocative and outlandish. He was known for trash-talking, and often free-styled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, anticipating elements of hip hop. Outside the ring, Ali attained success as a musician, where he received two Grammy nominations. He also featured as an actor and writer, releasing two autobiographies. Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and focused on religion and charity. In 1984, he made public his diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome, which some reports attribute to boxing-related injuries, though he and his specialist physicians disputed this. He remained an active public figure globally, but in his later years made increasingly limited public appearances as his condition worsened, and he was cared for by his family. Ali died on June 3, 2016. Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. () was born on January 17, 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky. He had a sister and four brothers. He was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. (1912\u20131990), who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky. Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar. He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with smaller amounts of Irish and English family heritage. Ali's maternal grandfather, Abe Grady, emigrated from Ennis, Co. Clare, Ireland. DNA testing performed in 2018 showed that, through his paternal grandmother, Ali was a descendant of the former slave Archer Alexander, who had been chosen from the building crew as the model of a freed man for the Emancipation Memorial, and was the subject of abolitionist William Greenleaf Eliot's book, The Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to Freedom. Like Ali, Alexander fought for his freedom. His father was a sign and billboard painter, and his mother, Odessa O'Grady Clay (1917\u20131994), was a domestic helper. Although Cassius Sr. was a Methodist, he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius Jr. and his younger brother, Rudolph \"Rudy\" Clay (later renamed Rahman Ali), as Baptists. Cassius Jr. attended Central High School in Louisville. He was dyslexic, which led to difficulties in reading and writing, at school and for much of his life. Ali grew up amid racial segregation. His mother recalled one occasion when he was denied a drink of water at a store\u2014\"They wouldn't give him one because of his color. That really affected him. \" He was also affected by the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, which led to young Clay and a friend taking out their frustration by vandalizing a local rail yard. Ali was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief's having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to \"whup\" the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first. Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting. He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the \"real training\", eventually molding \"my style, my stamina and my system. \" For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak. Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O'Keefe. He won by split decision. He went on to win six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an Amateur Athletic Union national title, and the Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Clay's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses. Ali said in his 1975 autobiography that shortly after his return from the Rome Olympics, he threw his gold medal into the Ohio River after he and a friend were refused service at a \"whites-only\" restaurant and fought with a white gang. The story was later disputed, and several of Ali's friends, including Bundini Brown and photographer Howard Bingham, denied it. Brown told Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram, \"Honkies sure bought into that one!\" Thomas Hauser's biography of Ali stated that Ali was refused service at the diner but that he lost his medal a year after he won it. Ali received a replacement medal at a basketball intermission during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he lit the torch to start the games. Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker. From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19\u20130 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones and Henry Cooper. Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match. These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down by both Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on to win in the predicted 5th round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963 was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number two and three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden. Jones staggered Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring. Watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay he might get locked up for murder. The fight was later named \"Fight of the Year\" by The Ring magazine. In each of these fights, Clay vocally belittled his opponents and vaunted his abilities. He called Jones \"an ugly little man\" and Cooper a \"bum\". He said he was embarrassed to get in the ring with Alex Miteff and claimed that Madison Square Garden was \"too small for me. \" His provocative and outlandish behavior in the ring was inspired by professional wrestler \"Gorgeous George\" Wagner. Ali stated in a 1969 interview with the Associated Press' Hubert Mizel that he met with Gorgeous George in Las Vegas in 1961 and that the wrestler inspired him to use wrestling jargon when he did interviews. In 1960 Clay left Moore's camp, partially due to Clay's refusal to do chores such as washing dishes and sweeping. To replace Moore, Clay hired Angelo Dundee to be his trainer. Clay had met Dundee in February 1957 during Clay's amateur career. Around this time, Clay sought longtime idol Sugar Ray Robinson to be his manager, but was rebuffed. By late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knock outs, Clay was a 7\u20131 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him \"the big ugly bear\", stating \"Liston even smells like a bear\" and claiming \"After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo. \" Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that \"someone is going to die at ringside tonight. \" Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54. Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout. The outcome of the fight was a major upset. At the opening bell, Liston rushed at Clay, seemingly angry and looking for a quick knockout. However, Clay's superior speed and mobility enabled him to elude Liston, making the champion miss and look awkward. At the end of the first round, Clay opened up his attack and hit Liston repeatedly with jabs. Liston fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round Clay hit Liston with a combination that buckled his knees and opened a cut under his left eye. This was the first time Liston had ever been cut. At the end of round four, Clay was returning to his corner when he began experiencing blinding pain in his eyes and asked his trainer, Angelo Dundee, to cut off his gloves. Dundee refused. It has been speculated that the problem was due to ointment used to seal Liston's cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by his corner to his gloves. Though unconfirmed, boxing historian Bert Sugar said that two of Liston's opponents also complained about their eyes \"burning\". Despite Liston's attempts to knock out a blinded Clay, Clay was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation from his eyes. In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by TKO. Liston stated that the reason he quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, a triumphant Clay rushed to the edge of the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted: \"Eat your words!\" He added, \"I am the greatest! I shook up the world. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived. \"At ringside post fight, Clay appeared unconvinced that the fight was stopped due to a Liston shoulder injury, saying that the only injury Liston had was \"an open eye, a big cut eye!\" When told by Joe Louis that the injury was a \"left arm thrown out of its socket,\" Clay quipped, \"Yeah, swinging at nothing, who wouldn't!\"In winning this fight at the age of 22, Clay became the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. However, Floyd Patterson remained the youngest to win the heavyweight championship, doing so at the age 21 during an elimination bout following Rocky Marciano's retirement. Mike Tyson broke both records in 1986 when he defeated Trevor Berbick to win the heavyweight title at age 20. Soon after the Liston fight, Clay changed his name to Cassius X, and then later to Muhammad Ali upon converting to Islam and affiliating with the Nation of Islam. Ali then faced a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine. It had been scheduled for Boston the previous November, but was postponed for six months due to Ali's emergency surgery for a hernia three days before. The fight was controversial. Midway through the first round, Liston was knocked down by a difficult-to-see blow the press dubbed a \"phantom punch\". Referee Jersey Joe Walcott did not begin the count immediately after the knockdown, as Ali refused to retreat to a neutral corner. Liston rose after he had been down for about 20 seconds, and the fight momentarily continued. However a few seconds later Walcott, having been informed by the timekeepers that Liston had been down for a count of 10, stopped the match and declared Ali the winner by knockout. The entire fight lasted less than two minutes. It has since been speculated that Liston purposely dropped to the ground. Proposed motivations include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam, that he had bet against himself and that he \"took a dive\" to pay off debts. Slow-motion replays show that Liston was jarred by a chopping right from Ali, although it is unclear whether the blow was a genuine knockout punch. Ali defended his title against former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson on November 22, 1965. Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known to call him by his former name Cassius Clay, as an \"Uncle Tom\", calling him \"The Rabbit\". Although Ali clearly had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. Patterson later said he had strained his sacroiliac. Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with Patterson during the fight. Patterson biographer W. K. Stratton claims that the conflict between Ali and Patterson was not genuine but was staged to increase ticket sales and the closed-circuit viewing audience, with both men complicit in the theatrics. Stratton also cites an interview by Howard Cosell in which Ali explained that rather than toying with Patterson, he refrained from knocking him out after it became apparent Patterson was injured. Patterson later said that he had never been hit by punches as soft as Ali's. Stratton states that Ali arranged the second fight, in 1972, with the financially struggling Patterson to help the former champion earn enough money to pay a debt to the IRS. After the Patterson fight, Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout. The company mainly handled Ali's boxing promotions and pay-per-view closed-circuit television broadcasts. The company's stockholders were mainly fellow Nation of Islam members, along with several others, including Bob Arum. Ali and then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell had agreed to meet for a bout in Chicago on March 29, 1966 (the WBA, one of two boxing associations, had stripped Ali of his title following his joining the Nation of Islam). But in February Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as 1-A from 1-Y, and he indicated that he would refuse to serve, commenting to the press, \"I ain't got nothing against no Viet Cong; no Viet Cong never called me nigger. \" Amidst the media and public outcry over Ali's stance, the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to sanction the fight, citing technicalities. Instead, Ali traveled to Canada and Europe and won championship bouts against George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Brian London and Karl Mildenberger. Ali returned to the United States to fight Cleveland Williams in the Houston Astrodome on November 14, 1966. The bout drew a record-breaking indoor crowd of 35,460 people. Williams had once been considered among the hardest punchers in the heavyweight division, but in 1964 he had been shot at point-blank range by a Texas policeman, resulting in the loss of one kidney and 3. 0 metres (10 ft) of his small intestine. Ali dominated Williams, winning a third-round technical knockout in what some consider the finest performance of his career. Ali fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell, who was unbeaten in five years and had defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced, was billed as Ali's toughest opponent since Liston; he was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali \"Clay\", much to Ali's annoyance. The two almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. \"I want to torture him\", he said. \"A clean knockout is too good for him. \" The fight was close until the seventh round, when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with jabs and shouting between punches, \"What's my name, Uncle Tom . . . what's my name?\" Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him in the eye, forcing him to fight half-blind, and then, in a clinch, rubbed the wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali's apparent intent to prolong the fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as \"one of the ugliest boxing fights. \" Tex Maule later wrote: \"It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty. \" Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Ali's critics, the fight provided more evidence of his arrogance. After Ali's title defense against Zora Folley on March 22, he was stripped of his title due to his refusal to be drafted to army service. His boxing license was also suspended by the state of New York. He was convicted of draft evasion on June 20 and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He paid a bond and remained free while the verdict was being appealed. In March 1966, Ali refused to be inducted into the armed forces. He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970\u2014from ages 25 to almost 29\u2014as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971. During this time of inactivity, as opposition to the Vietnam War began to grow and Ali's stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African-American pride and racial justice. While banned from sanctioned bouts, Ali settled a $1 million lawsuit against radio producer Murray Woroner by accepting $10,000 to appear in a privately staged fantasy fight against retired champion Rocky Marciano. In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they acted out several different endings. A computer program purportedly determined the winner, based on data about the fighters. Edited versions of the bout were shown in movie theaters in 1970. In the U. S. version Ali lost in a simulated 13th-round knockout, but in the European version Marciano lost due to cuts, also simulated. Ali suggested that prejudice determined his defeat in the U. S. version. He was reported to jokingly say, \"That computer was made in Alabama. \" On August 11, 1970, with his case still in appeal, Ali was granted a license to box by the City of Atlanta Athletic Commission. Leroy Johnson, Jesse Hill Jr. and Harry Pett had used their local political influence and set up the company House of Sports to organize the fight, underlining the influence power of Georgia's black politics in Ali' s comeback. Ali's first return bout was against Jerry Quarry on October 26, resulting in a win after three rounds after Quarry was cut. A month earlier, a victory in federal court forced the New York State Boxing Commission to reinstate Ali's license. He fought Oscar Bonavena at Madison Square Garden in December, an uninspired performance that ended in a dramatic technical knockout of Bonavena in the 15th round. The win left Ali as a top contender against heavyweight champion Joe Frazier. Ali and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the \"Fight of the Century\", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim to be heavyweight champion. Veteran boxing writer John Condon called it \"the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life. \" The bout was broadcast to 35 foreign countries; promoters granted 760 press passes. Adding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a \"dumb tool of the white establishment. \" \"Frazier is too ugly to be champ\", Ali said. \"Frazier is too dumb to be champ. \" Ali also frequently called Frazier an \"Uncle Tom\". Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, \"Ali was saying 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the Ku Klux Klan. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto. ' Joe was sitting there, smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, 'What the fuck does he know about the ghetto?'\"Ali began training at a farm near Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1971 and, finding the country setting to his liking, sought to develop a real training camp in the countryside. He found a five-acre site on a Pennsylvania country road in the village of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. On this site, Ali carved out what was to become his training camp, where he trained for all his fights from 1972 to the end of his career in 1981. The Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head \"no\" after he was hit. In the later rounds\u2014in what was the first appearance of the \"rope-a-dope strategy\"\u2014Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee Arthur Mercante said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds. Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat. In 1971, basketball star Wilt Chamberlain challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26. Although the seven-foot-two-inch tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali\u2014weighing 60 pounds more and able to reach 14 inches further\u2014Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of \"Timber!\" and \"The tree will fall\" during a shared interview. These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed \"this boxing foolishness\", and he did exactly that. To replace Ali's opponent, promoter Bob Arum quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali's, Jimmy Ellis, who was a childhood friend from Louisville, Kentucky, to fight him. After the loss to Frazier, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson and faced Bob Foster in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year. In 1973, Ken Norton broke Ali's jaw while giving him the second loss of his career. After initially considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout. This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman. Ali was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round. Referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover. However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly. Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision. The defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, on October 30, 1974\u2014a bout nicknamed The Rumble in the Jungle. Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts. Ali was 32 years old, and had clearly lost speed and reflexes since his twenties. Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence. Almost no-one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning. As usual, Ali was confident and colorful before the fight. He told interviewer David Frost, \"If you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait 'til I whup Foreman's behind!\" He told the press, \"I've done something new for this fight. I done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail; only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick; I'm so mean I make medicine sick. \" Ali was wildly popular in Zaire, with crowds chanting \"Ali, bomaye\" (\"Ali, kill him\") wherever he went. Ali opened the fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman's head. Then, beginning in the second round, and to the consternation of his corner, Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the \"Rope-a-dope\", so violated conventional boxing wisdom\u2014letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will\u2014that at ringside writer George Plimpton thought the fight had to be fixed. Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. Reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: \"I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: 'That all you got, George?' I realized that this ain't what I thought it was. \" It was a major upset victory, after Ali came in as a 4\u20131 underdog against the previously unbeaten, heavy-hitting Foreman. The fight became famous for Ali's introduction of the rope-a-dope tactic. The fight was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide. It was the world's most-watched live television broadcast at the time. Ali's next opponents included Chuck Wepner, Ron Lyle, and Joe Bugner. Wepner, a journeyman known as \"The Bayonne Bleeder\", stunned Ali with a knockdown in the ninth round; Ali would later say he tripped on Wepner's foot. It was a bout that would inspire Sylvester Stallone to create the acclaimed film, Rocky. Ali then agreed to a third match with Joe Frazier in Manila. The bout, known as the \"Thrilla in Manila\", was held on October 1, 1975, in temperatures approaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier. However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the \"rope-a-dope\" strategy, frequently resorting to clinches. During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counter-punching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye. With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called \"target practice\" on Frazier's head. The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests. Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut. Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, clearly spent. An ailing Ali said afterwards that the fight \"was the closest thing to dying that I know\", and, when later asked if he had viewed the fight on videotape, reportedly said, \"Why would I want to go back and see Hell?\" After the fight he cited Frazier as \"the greatest fighter of all times next to me. \" Following the Manila bout, Ali fought Jean-Pierre Coopman, Jimmy Young, and Richard Dunn, winning the last by knockout. The punch Ali used to knockout Dunn was taught to Ali by Taekwondo Grandmaster Jhoon Rhee. Rhee called that punch the \"Accupunch\", he learnt it from Bruce Lee. The Dunn fight was the last time Ali would knock down an opponent in his boxing career. On June 1, 1976, Ali removed his shirt and jacket and confronted professional wrestler Gorilla Monsoon in the ring after his match at a World Wide Wrestling Federation show in Philadelphia Arena. After dodging a few punches, Monsoon put Ali in an airplane spin and dumped him to the mat. Ali stumbled to the corner, where his associate Butch Lewis convinced him to walk away. On June 26, 1976, Ali participated in an exhibition bout in Tokyo against Japanese professional wrestler and martial artist Antonio Inoki. Ali was only able to land two jabs while Inoki's kicks caused two blood clots and an infection that almost resulted in Ali's leg being amputated. The match was not scripted and ultimately declared a draw. After Ali's death, The New York Times declared it his least memorable fight. Most boxing commentators at the time viewed the fight negatively and hoped it would be forgotten as some considered it a \"15-round farce. \" Today it is considered by some to be one of Ali's most influential fights and CBS Sports said the attention the mixed-style bout received \"foretold the arrival of standardized MMA years later. \"Ali fought Ken Norton for the third time in September 1976. The bout, which was held at Yankee Stadium, resulted in Ali winning a heavily contested decision that was loudly booed by the audience. Afterwards, he announced he was retiring from boxing to practice his faith, having converted to Sunni Islam after falling out with the Nation of Islam the previous year. After returning to beat Alfredo Evangelista in May 1977, Ali struggled in his next fight against Earnie Shavers that September, getting pummeled a few times by punches to the head. Ali won the fight by another unanimous decision, but the bout caused his longtime doctor Ferdie Pacheco to quit after he was rebuffed for telling Ali he should retire. Pacheco was quoted as saying, \"the New York State Athletic Commission gave me a report that showed Ali's kidneys were falling apart. I wrote to Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, his wife and Ali himself. I got nothing back in response. That's when I decided enough is enough. \"In February 1978, Ali faced Leon Spinks at the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas. At the time, Spinks had only seven professional fights to his credit, and had recently fought a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux. Ali sparred less than two dozen rounds in preparation for the fight, and was seriously out of shape by the opening bell. He lost the title by split decision. A rematch occurred in September at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. 70,000 people attended the bout and paid a total of $6 million admission, making it the largest live gate in boxing history at that time. Ali won a unanimous decision in an uninspiring fight, with referee Lucien Joubert scoring rounds 10-4, judge Ernie Cojoe 10-4, and judge Herman Preis 11-4. This made Ali the first heavyweight champion to win the belt three times. Following this win, on July 27, 1979, Ali announced his retirement from boxing. His retirement was short-lived, however; Ali announced his comeback to face Larry Holmes for the WBC belt in an attempt to win the heavyweight championship an unprecedented fourth time. The fight was largely motivated by Ali's need for money. Boxing writer Richie Giachetti said, \"Larry didn't want to fight Ali. He knew Ali had nothing left; he knew it would be a horror. \" It was around this time that Ali started struggling with vocal stutters and trembling hands. The Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) ordered that he undergo a complete physical in Las Vegas before being allowed to fight again. Ali chose instead to check into the Mayo Clinic, who declared him fit to fight. Their opinion was accepted by the NAC on July 31, 1980, paving the way for Ali's return to the ring. The fight took place on October 2, 1980, in Las Vegas Valley, with Holmes easily dominating Ali, who was weakened from thyroid medication he had taken to lose weight. Giachetti called the fight \"awful . . . the worst sports event I ever had to cover. \" Actor Sylvester Stallone was at ringside and said that it was like watching an autopsy on a man who is still alive. In the eleventh round, Angelo Dundee told the referee to stop the fight, making it the only time that Ali ever lost by stoppage. The Holmes fight is said to have contributed to Ali's Parkinson's syndrome. Despite pleas to definitively retire, Ali fought one last time on December 11, 1981, in Nassau, Bahamas, against Trevor Berbick, losing a ten-round decision. By the end of his boxing career Ali had absorbed 200,000 hits. Ali was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons. Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad and asked her to marry him after their first date. They were wed approximately one month later on August 14, 1964. They quarreled over Sonji's refusal to adhere to strict Islamic dress and behavior codes, and her questioning of Elijah Muhammad's teachings. According to Ali, \"She wouldn't do what she was supposed to do. She wore lipstick; she went into bars; she dressed in clothes that were revealing and didn't look right. \" The marriage was childless and they divorced on January 10, 1966. Just before the divorce was finalized, Ali sent Sonji a note: \"You traded heaven for hell, baby. \"On August 17, 1967, Ali married Belinda Boyd. Born into a Chicago family that had converted to the Nation Of Islam, she later changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called Belinda by old friends and family. They had four children: author and rapper Maryum \"May May\" (born 1968); twins Jamillah and Rasheda (born 1970), who married Robert Walsh and has a son, Biaggio Ali, born in 1998; and Muhammad Ali, Jr. (born 1972). Ali was a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, in the early 1970s. At age 32 in 1974, Ali began an illicit extramarital relationship with 16-year-old Wanda Bolton (who subsequently changed her name to Aaisha Ali) with whom he fathered another daughter, Khaliah (born 1974). While still married to Belinda, Ali married Aaisha in an Islamic ceremony that was not legally recognized. According to Khaliah, Aaisha and her mother lived at Ali's Deer Lake training camp alongside Belinda and her children. In January 1985 Aaisha sued Ali for unpaid palimony. The case was settled when Ali agreed to set up a $200,000 trust fund for Khaliah. In 2001 Khaliah was quoted as saying she believed her father viewed her as \"a mistake. \" He had another daughter, Miya (born 1972), from an extramarital relationship with Patricia Harvell. By the summer of 1977, his second marriage was over and he had married Veronica Porch\u00e9. At the time of their marriage, they had a baby girl, Hana, and Veronica was pregnant with their second child. Their second daughter, Laila Ali, was born in December 1977. By 1986, Ali and Porch\u00e9 were divorced. On November 19, 1986, Ali married Yolanda (\"Lonnie\") Williams. They had been friends since 1964 in Louisville. Together they adopted a son, Asaad Amin, when Asaad was five months old. Kiiursti Mensah-Ali says she is Ali's biological daughter with Barbara Mensah, with whom he allegedly had a 20-year relationship, citing photographs and a paternity test conducted in 1988. She said he accepted responsibility and took care of her, but all contacts with him were cut off after he married his fourth wife Lonnie. Kiiursti says she has a relationship with his other children. After his death she again made passionate appeals to be allowed to mourn at his funeral. In 2010, Osmon Williams came forward claiming to be Ali's biological son. His mother Temica Williams (also known as Rebecca Holloway) had launched a $3 million lawsuit against Ali in 1981 for sexual assault, claiming that she had started a sexual relationship with him when she was 12, and that her son Osmon (born 1977) was fathered by Ali. She further alleged that Ali had originally supported her and her son financially, but stopped doing so after four years. The case went on until 1986 and was eventually thrown out as her allegations were deemed to be barred by the statute of limitations. According to Veronica, Ali admitted to the affair with Williams, but did not believe Osmon was his son. Ali then lived in Scottsdale, Arizona, with Lonnie. In January 2007 it was reported that they had put their home in Berrien Springs, Michigan, which they had bought in 1975, up for sale and had purchased a home in eastern Jefferson County, Kentucky for $1,875,000. Both homes were subsequently sold after Ali's death with Lonnie living in their remaining home in Paradise Valley, Arizona. Lonnie converted to Islam from Catholicism in her late twenties. Ali's daughter Laila was a professional boxer from 1999 until 2007, despite her father's previous opposition to women's boxing. In 1978 he said \"Women are not made to be hit in the breast, and face like that . . . the body's not made to be punched right here [patting his chest]. Get hit in the breast . . . hard . . . and all that. \" Ali nevertheless attended a number of his daughter's fights. Ali's daughter Hana is married to Bellator middleweight fighter Kevin Casey. Ali said that he first heard of the Nation of Islam when he was fighting in the Golden Gloves tournament in Chicago in 1959, and attended his first Nation of Islam meeting in 1961. He continued to attend meetings, although keeping his involvement hidden from the public. In 1962, Clay met Malcolm X, who soon became his spiritual and political mentor. By the time of the first Liston fight, Nation of Islam members, including Malcolm X, were visible in his entourage. This led to a story in The Miami Herald just before the fight disclosing that Clay had joined the Nation of Islam, which nearly caused the bout to be canceled. The article quoted Cassius Clay Sr. as saying that his son had joined the Black Muslims when he was 18. In fact, Clay was initially refused entry to the Nation of Islam (often called the Black Muslims at the time) due to his boxing career. However, after he won the championship from Liston in 1964, the Nation of Islam was more receptive and agreed to publicize his membership. Shortly afterwards on March 6, Elijah Muhammad gave a radio address that Clay would be renamed Muhammad (one who is worthy of praise) Ali (most high). Around that time Ali moved to the south side of Chicago and lived in a series of houses, always near the Nation of Islam's Mosque Maryam or Elijah Muhammad's residence. He stayed in Chicago for about 12 years. Only a few journalists (most notably Howard Cosell) accepted the new name at that time. Ali later announced: \"Cassius Clay is my slave name. \" Not afraid to antagonize the white establishment, Ali stated, \"I am America. I am the part you won't recognize. But get used to me. Black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own; get used to me. \" Ali's friendship with Malcolm X ended as Malcolm split with the Nation of Islam a couple of weeks after Ali joined, and Ali remained with the Nation of Islam. Ali later said that turning his back on Malcolm was one of the mistakes he regretted most in his life. Aligning himself with the Nation of Islam, its leader Elijah Muhammad, and a narrative that labeled the white race as the perpetrator of genocide against African Americans made Ali a target of public condemnation. The Nation of Islam was widely viewed by whites and some African Americans as a black separatist \"hate religion\" with a propensity toward violence; Ali had few qualms about using his influential voice to speak Nation of Islam doctrine. In a press conference articulating his opposition to the Vietnam War, Ali stated, \"My enemy is the white people, not Viet Cong or Chinese or Japanese. \" In relation to integration, he said: \"We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don't want to be forced to integrate. Integration is wrong. We don't want to live with the white man; that's all. \"Writer Jerry Izenberg once noted that, \"the Nation became Ali's family and Elijah Muhammad became his father. But there is an irony to the fact that while the Nation branded white people as devils, Ali had more white colleagues than most African American people did at that time in America, and continued to have them throughout his career. \" In a 2004 autobiography, Ali attributed his conversion to mainstream Sunni Islam to Warith Deen Muhammad, who assumed leadership of the Nation of Islam upon the death of his father Elijah Muhammad, and persuaded the Nation's followers to become adherents of Sunni Islam. Ali had gone on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1972, which inspired him in a similar manner to Malcolm X, meeting people of different colors from all over the world giving him a different outlook and greater spiritual awareness. In 1977, he said that, after he retired, he would dedicate the rest of his life to getting \"ready to meet God\" by helping people, charitable causes, uniting people and helping to make peace. He went on another Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1988. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, he stated that \"Islam is a religion of peace\" and \"does not promote terrorism or killing people\", and that he was \"angry that the world sees a certain group of Islam followers who caused this destruction, but they are not real Muslims. They are racist fanatics who call themselves Muslims. \" In December 2015, he stated that \"True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so-called Islamic jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion\", that \"We as Muslims have to stand up to those who use Islam to advance their own personal agenda\", and that \"political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is. \"In later life, Ali developed an interest in Sufism, which he referenced in his autobiography, The Soul of a Butterfly. Around 2005, Ali converted to Sufi Islam. According to Ali's daughter, Hana Yasmeen Ali, who co-authored The Soul of a Butterfly with him, Ali was attracted to Sufism after reading the books of Inayat Khan, which contain Sufi teachings. Ali later moved away from Inayat Khan's teachings of Universal Sufism after traditional Sunni-Sufis criticized the movement as being contrary to the actual teachings of Sunni Islam. Muhammad Ali received guidance from Sunni-Sufi Islamic scholars such as Grand Mufti of Syria Almarhum Asy-Syaikh Ahmed Kuftaro, Hisham Kabbani, Imam Zaid Shakir, Hamza Yusuf, and Timothy J. Gianotti, who was at Ali's bedside during his last days and ensured that his funeral was in accordance with Islamic rites and rituals. In 1976 inventor Alan Amron and businessman Joel Sacher partnered with Ali to promote The International Committee to Reunite the Beatles. They asked fans worldwide to contribute a dollar each. Ali said the idea was not to use the proceeds for profit, but to establish an international agency to help poor children. \"This is money to help people all over the world\", he said. He added, \"I love the music. I used to train to their music. \" He said a reunion of the Beatles \"would make a lot of people happy. \" The former Beatles were indifferent to the plan, which elicited only a tepid response from the public. No reunion happened. Ali registered for conscription in the United States military on his 18th birthday and was listed as 1-A in 1962. In 1964, he was reclassified as Class 1-Y (fit for service only in times of national emergency) after he failed the U. S. Armed Forces qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were sub-standard, due to his dyslexia. (He was quoted as saying, \"I said I was the greatest, not the smartest!\") By early 1966, the army lowered its standards to permit soldiers above the 15th percentile and Ali was again classified as 1-A. This classification meant he was now eligible for the draft and induction into the U. S. Army at a time when the U. S. was involved in the Vietnam War, a war which put him further at odds with the white establishment. When notified of this status, Ali declared that he would refuse to serve in the army and publicly considered himself a conscientious objector. Ali stated: \"War is against the teachings of the Qur'an. I'm not trying to dodge the draft. We are not supposed to take part in no wars unless declared by Allah or The Messenger. We don't take part in Christian wars or wars of any unbelievers. \" He stated: \"Man, I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong. \" Ali elaborated: \"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go ten thousand miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?\" Ali antagonized the white establishment in 1966 by refusing to be drafted into the U. S. military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War. On April 28, 1967, Ali appeared in Houston for his scheduled induction into the U. S. Armed Forces, but he refused three times to step forward when his name was called. An officer warned him that he was committing a felony punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Once more, Ali refused to budge when his name was called, and he was arrested. Later that same day, the New York State Athletic Commission suspended his boxing license and stripped him of his title. Other boxing commissions followed suit. Ali remained unable to obtain a license to box in any state for over three years. At the trial on June 20, 1967, the jury found Ali guilty after only 21 minutes of deliberation of the criminal offense of violating the Selective Service laws by refusing to be drafted. After a Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, the case was reviewed by the U. S. Supreme Court in 1971. Ali remained free in the years between the Appellate Court decision and the Supreme Court ruling. As public opinion began turning people against the war and the Civil Rights Movement continued to gather momentum, Ali became a popular speaker at colleges and universities across the country; this itinerary was rare if not unprecedented for a prizefighter. At Howard University, for example, he gave his popular \"Black Is Best\" speech to 4,000 cheering students and community intellectuals, after he was invited to speak by sociology professor Nathan Hare on behalf of the Black Power Committee, a student protest group. On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States in Clay v. United States overturned Ali's conviction by a unanimous 8\u20130 decision (Justice Thurgood Marshall recused himself, as he had been the U. S. Solicitor General at the time of Ali's conviction). The decision was not based on, nor did it address, the merits of Ali's claims per se; rather, the Court held that since the appeal board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to Ali, and that it was therefore impossible to determine which of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status offered in the Justice Department's brief that the appeal board relied on, Ali's conviction must be reversed. Ali's example inspired countless black Americans and others. The New York Times columnist William Rhoden wrote, \"Ali's actions changed my standard of what constituted an athlete's greatness. Possessing a killer jump shot or the ability to stop on a dime was no longer enough. What were you doing for the liberation of your people? What were you doing to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?\"Recalling Ali's anti-war position, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said: \"I remember the teachers at my high school didn't like Ali because he was so anti-establishment and he kind of thumbed his nose at authority and got away with it. The fact that he was proud to be a black man and that he had so much talent . . . made some people think that he was dangerous. But for those very reasons I enjoyed him. \"Civil rights figures came to believe that Ali had an energizing effect on the freedom movement as a whole. Al Sharpton spoke of his bravery at a time when there was still widespread support for the Vietnam War. \"For the heavyweight champion of the world, who had achieved the highest level of athletic celebrity, to put all of that on the line\u2014the money, the ability to get endorsements\u2014to sacrifice all of that for a cause, gave a whole sense of legitimacy to the movement and the causes with young people that nothing else could have done. Even those who were assassinated, certainly lost their lives, but they didn't voluntarily do that. He knew he was going to jail and did it anyway. That's another level of leadership and sacrifice. \"Ali was honored with the annual Martin Luther King Award in 1970 by civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy, who called him \"a living example of soul power, the March on Washington in two fists. \" Coretta Scott King added that Ali was \"a champion of justice and peace and unity. \"In speaking of the cost on Ali's career of his refusal to be drafted, his trainer Angelo Dundee said, \"One thing must be taken into account when talking about Ali: He was robbed of his best years, his prime years. \"Bob Arum did not support Ali's choice at the time. More recently, Arum stated that \"when I look back at his life, and I was blessed to call him a friend and spent a lot of time with him, it's hard for me to talk about his exploits in boxing because as great as they were they paled in comparison to the impact that he had on the world,\" and \"He did what he thought was right. And it turned out he was right, and I was wrong. \"Ali's resistance to the draft was covered in the 2013 documentary The Trials of Muhammad Ali. In a secret operation code-named \"Minaret\", the National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted the communications of leading Americans, including Ali, Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , prominent U. S. journalists, and others who criticized the U. S. war in Vietnam. A review by the NSA of the Minaret program concluded that it was \"disreputable if not outright illegal. \"In 1971, his Fight of the Century with Frazier provided cover for an activist group, the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI, to pull off a burglary at an FBI office in Pennsylvania, which exposed the COINTELPRO operations that included illegal spying on activists involved with the civil rights and anti-war movements. One of the COINTELPRO targets was Ali, which included the FBI gaining access to his records as far back as elementary school; one such record mentioned him loving art as a child. Ali had a cameo role in the 1962 film version of Requiem for a Heavyweight, and during his exile from boxing, he starred in the short-lived 1969 Broadway musical, Buck White. He also appeared in the documentary film Black Rodeo (1972) riding both a horse and a bull. His autobiography The Greatest: My Own Story, written with Richard Durham, was published in 1975. In 1977 the book was adapted into a film called The Greatest, in which Ali played himself and Ernest Borgnine played Angelo Dundee. The film Freedom Road, made in 1978, features Ali in a rare acting role as Gideon Jackson, a former slave and Union (American Civil War) soldier in 1870s Virginia, who gets elected to the U. S. Senate and battles other former slaves and white sharecroppers to keep the land they have tended all their lives. Ali often used rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, both for when he was trash-talking in boxing and as political poetry for his activism outside of boxing. He played a role in the shaping of the black poetic tradition, paving the way for The Last Poets in 1968, Gil Scott-Heron in 1970, and the emergence of rap music in the 1970s. According to The Guardian, \"Some have argued that\" Ali was \"the first rapper. \"In 1963, Ali released an album of spoken word music on Columbia Records titled, I Am the Greatest, and in 1964, he recorded a cover version of the rhythm and blues song \"Stand by Me\". I Am the Greatest sold 500,000 copies, and has been identified as an early example of rap music and a precursor to hip hop. It reached number 61 on the album chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award. He later received a second Grammy nomination, for \"Best Recording for Children\", with his 1976 spoken word novelty record, The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay. Ali was an influential figure in the world of hip hop music. As a \"rhyming trickster\", he was noted for his \"funky delivery\", \"boasts\", \"comical trash-talk\", and \"endless quotables. \" According to Rolling Stone, his \"freestyle skills\" and his \"rhymes, flow, and braggadocio\" would \"one day become typical of old school MCs\" like Run\u2013D. M. C. and LL Cool J, and his \"outsized ego foreshadowed the vainglorious excesses of Kanye West, while his Afrocentric consciousness and cutting honesty pointed forward to modern bards like Rakim, Nas, Jay-Z, and Kendrick Lamar. \" \u201cI\u2019ve wrestled with alligators, I\u2019ve tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning and throw thunder in jail. You know I\u2019m bad. Just last week, I murdered a rock, Injured a stone, Hospitalized a brick. I\u2019m so mean, I make medicine sick \u201d \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see. Now you see me, now you don't. George thinks he will, but I know he won't. \u201d Ali spoke like no man the world had seen before. So confident in what he said; fluent, smooth, creative, and intimidating. He was a boxer and an activist, but he also had a role in influencing what now dominated pop-culture, hip-hop. In 2006, the documentary Ali Rap was produced by ESPN. Chuck D, a rapper for the band Public Enemy is the host. Other rappers narrated the documentary as well, including Doug E Fresh, Ludacris and Rakim who all spoke on Ali's behalf in the film. He has been cited as an inspiration by rappers such as LL Cool J, Public Enemy's Chuck D, Jay-Z, Eminem, Sean Combs, Slick Rick, Nas and MC Lyte. Ali has been referenced in a number of hip hop songs, including Migos \"Fight Night\", The Game's \"Jesus Piece\", Nas' \"The Message, The Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\", the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\", EPMD's \"You're a Customer\" and Will Smith's \"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\". Muhammad Ali's fights were some of the world's most-watched television broadcasts, setting television viewership records. His most-watched fights drew an estimated 1\u20132 billion viewers worldwide between 1974 and 1980, and were the world's most-watched live television broadcasts at the time. Outside of fights, he made many other television appearances. The following table lists known viewership figures of his non-fight television appearances. In 1984, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome, a disease that sometimes results from head trauma from violent physical activities such as boxing. Ali still remained active during this time, later participating as a guest referee at WrestleMania I. Ali was known for being a humanitarian and philanthropist. He focused on practicing his Islamic duty of charity and good deeds, donating millions to charity organizations and disadvantaged people of all religious backgrounds. It is estimated that Ali helped to feed more than 22 million people afflicted by hunger across the world. Ali began visiting Africa starting in 1964, when he visited Ghana. In 1974, he visited a Palestinian refugee camp in Southern Lebanon, where Ali declared \"support for the Palestinian struggle to liberate their homeland. \" In 1978, following his loss to Spinks and before winning the rematch, Ali visited Bangladesh and received honorary citizenship there. The same year, he participated in The Longest Walk, a protest march in the United States in support of Native American rights, along with singer Stevie Wonder and actor Marlon Brando. In 1980, Ali was recruited by President Jimmy Carter for a diplomatic mission to Africa, in an effort to persuade a number of African governments to join the US-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics (in response to the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan). According to Ali biographer Thomas Hauser, \"at best, it was ill-conceived; at worst, a diplomatic disaster. \" The Tanzanian government was insulted that Carter had sent an athlete to discuss a serious political issue. One official asked whether the United States would \"send Chris Evert to negotiate with London. \" Consequently, Ali was only received by the youth and culture minister, rather than President Julius Nyerere. Ali was unable to explain why the African countries should join the US boycott when it had failed to support the African boycott of the 1976 Olympics (in protest at Apartheid in South Africa), and was unaware that the Soviet Union was sponsoring popular revolutionary movements in Africa. Ali conceded \"They didn't tell me about that in America\", and complained that Carter had sent him \"around the world to take the whupping over American policies. \" The Nigerian government also rebuffed him and confirmed that they would be participating in the Moscow games. Ali did, however, convince the government of Kenya to boycott the Olympics. On January 19, 1981, in Los Angeles, Ali talked a suicidal man down from jumping off a ninth-floor ledge, an event that made national news. In 1984, Ali announced his support for the re-election of United States President Ronald Reagan. When asked to elaborate on his endorsement of Reagan, Ali told reporters, \"He's keeping God in schools and that's enough. \" In 1985, he visited Israel to request the release of Muslim prisoners at Atlit detainee camp, which Israel declined. Around 1987, the California Bicentennial Foundation for the U. S. Constitution selected Ali to personify the vitality of the U. S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Ali rode on a float at the following year's Tournament of Roses Parade, launching the U. S. Constitution's 200th birthday commemoration. In 1988, during the First Intifada, Ali participated in a Chicago rally in support of Palestine. The same year, he visited Sudan to raise awareness about the plight of famine victims. In 1989, he participated in an Indian charity event with the Muslim Educational Society in Kozhikode, Kerala, along with Bollywood actor Dilip Kumar. In 1990, Ali traveled to Iraq prior to the Gulf War, and met with Saddam Hussein in an attempt to negotiate the release of American hostages. Ali secured the release of the hostages, in exchange for promising Hussein that he would bring America \"an honest account\" of Iraq. Despite rescuing hostages, he received criticism from President George H. W. Bush, diplomat Joseph C. Wilson, and The New York Times. Ali published an oral history, Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times by Thomas Hauser, in 1991. In 1994, Ali campaigned to the United States government to come to the aid of refugees afflicted by the Rwandan genocide, and to donate to organizations helping Rwandan refugees. In 1996, he had the honor of lighting the flame at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. It was watched by an estimated 3. 5 billion viewers worldwide. Ali's bout with Parkinson's led to a gradual decline in his health, though he was still active into the early years of the millennium, promoting his own biopic, Ali, in 2001. That year he also contributed an on-camera segment to the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert. In 1998, Ali began working with actor Michael J Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, to raise awareness and fund research for a cure. They made a joint appearance before Congress to push the case in 2002. In 2000, Ali worked with the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Disease to raise awareness and encourage donations for research. On November 17, 2002, Ali went to Afghanistan as the \"U. N. Messenger of Peace. \" He was in Kabul for a three-day goodwill mission as a special guest of the UN. On September 1, 2009, Ali visited Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, the home of his great-grandfather, Abe Grady, who emigrated to the U. S. in the 1860s, eventually settling in Kentucky. On July 27, 2012, Ali was a titular bearer of the Olympic flag during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He was helped to his feet by his wife Lonnie to stand before the flag due to his Parkinson's rendering him unable to carry it into the stadium. The same year, he was awarded the Philadelphia Liberty Medal in recognition of his lifelong efforts in activism, philanthropy and humanitarianism. In 2014, Ali tweeted in support of Trayvon Martin and the Black Lives Matter movement. By 1978, Ali's total fight purse earnings were estimated to be nearly $60 million (inflation-adjusted $312 million), including an estimated $47. 45 million grossed between 1970 and 1978. By 1980, his total fight purse earnings were estimated to be up to $70 million (inflation-adjusted $332 million). In 1978, Ali revealed that he was \"broke\" and several news outlets reported his net worth to be an estimated $3. 5 million (inflation-adjusted $13 million). The press attributed his decline in wealth to several factors, including taxes accounting for at least half of his income, management taking a third of his income, his lifestyle, and spending on family, charity and religious causes. In 2006, Ali sold his name and image for $50 million, after which Forbes estimated his net worth to be $55 million in 2006. Following his death in 2016, his fortune was estimated to be between $50 million and $80 million. In February 2013, Ali's brother Rahman Ali said Muhammad could no longer speak and could be dead within days. Ali's daughter May May Ali responded to the rumors, stating that she had talked to him on the phone the morning of February 3 and he was fine. On December 20, 2014, Ali was hospitalized for a mild case of pneumonia. Ali was once again hospitalized on January 15, 2015, for a urinary tract infection after being found unresponsive at a guest house in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was released the next day. Ali was hospitalized in Scottsdale, Arizona on June 2, 2016, with a respiratory illness. Though his condition was initially described as \"fair\", it worsened, and he died the following day at the age of 74 from septic shock. Following Ali's death, he was the number-one trending topic on Twitter for over 12 hours and on Facebook for several days. BET played their documentary Muhammad Ali: Made In Miami. ESPN played four hours of non-stop commercial-free coverage of Ali. News networks, such as ABC News, BBC, CNN, and Fox News, also covered him extensively. He was mourned globally, and a family spokesman said the family \"certainly believes that Muhammad was a citizen of the world . . . and they know that the world grieves with him. \" Politicians such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, David Cameron and more paid tribute to Ali. Ali also received numerous tributes from the world of sports including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Floyd Mayweather, Mike Tyson, the Miami Marlins, LeBron James, Steph Curry and more. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer stated, \"Muhammad Ali belongs to the world. But he only has one hometown. \" Ali's funeral had been pre-planned by himself and others for several years prior to his actual death. The services began in Louisville on June 9, 2016, with an Islamic Janazah prayer service at Freedom Hall on the grounds of the Kentucky Exposition Center. On June 10, 2016, the funeral procession passed through the streets of Louisville ending at Cave Hill Cemetery, where his body was interred during a private ceremony. His grave is marked with a simple granite marker that bears only his name. A public memorial service for Ali at downtown Louisville's KFC Yum! Center was held during the afternoon of June 10. The pallbearers included Will Smith, Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson, with honorary pallbearers including George Chuvalo, Larry Holmes and George Foreman. Ali's memorial was watched by an estimated 1 billion viewers worldwide. Muhammad Ali defeated every top heavyweight in his era, which has been called the golden age of heavyweight boxing. Ali was named \"Fighter of the Year\" by The Ring magazine more times than any other fighter, and was involved in more Ring \"Fight of the Year\" bouts than any other fighter. He was an inductee into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and held wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees. He was one of only three boxers to be named \"Sportsman of the Year\" by Sports Illustrated. In 1978, three years before Ali's permanent retirement, the Louisville Board of Aldermen in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, voted 6\u20135 to rename Walnut Street to Muhammad Ali Boulevard. This was controversial at the time, as within a week 12 of the 70 street signs were stolen. Earlier that year, a committee of the Jefferson County Public Schools (Kentucky) considered renaming Ali's alma mater, Central High School, in his honor, but the motion failed to pass. In time, Muhammad Ali Boulevard\u2014and Ali himself\u2014came to be well accepted in his hometown. In 1993, the Associated Press reported that Ali was tied with Babe Ruth as the most recognized athlete, out of over 800 dead or living athletes, in America. The study found that over 97% of Americans over 12 years of age identified both Ali and Ruth. He was the recipient of the 1997 Arthur Ashe Courage Award. In 1999, Time magazine named Ali one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. He was crowned Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated. Named Sports Personality of the Century in a BBC poll, he received more votes than the other contenders (which included Pel\u00e9, Jesse Owens and Jack Nicklaus) combined. On September 13, 1999, Ali was named \"Kentucky Athlete of the Century\" by the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in ceremonies at the Galt House East. On January 8, 2001, Muhammad Ali was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton. In November 2005, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush, followed by the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold of the UN Association of Germany (DGVN) in Berlin for his work with the civil rights movement and the United Nations, which he received on December 17, 2005. On November 19, 2005 (Ali's 19th wedding anniversary), the $60 million non-profit Muhammad Ali Center opened in downtown Louisville. In addition to displaying his boxing memorabilia, the center focuses on core themes of peace, social responsibility, respect, and personal growth. On June 5, 2007, he received an honorary doctorate of humanities at Princeton University's 260th graduation ceremony. Ali Mall, located in Araneta Center, Quezon City, Philippines, is named after him. Construction of the mall, the first of its kind in the Philippines, began shortly after Ali's victory in a match with Joe Frazier in nearby Araneta Coliseum in 1975. The mall opened in 1976 with Ali attending its opening. The 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki fight played an important role in the history of mixed martial arts. In Japan, the match inspired Inoki's students Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki to found Pancrase in 1993, which in turn inspired the foundation of Pride Fighting Championships in 1997. Pride was acquired by its rival, Ultimate Fighting Championship, in 2007. The Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act was introduced in 1999 and passed in 2000, to protect the rights and welfare of boxers in the United States. In May 2016, a bill was introduced to United States Congress by Markwayne Mullin, a politician and former MMA fighter, to extend the Ali Act to mixed martial arts. In June 2016, US senator Rand Paul proposed an amendment to the US draft laws named after Ali, a proposal to eliminate the Selective Service System. In 2015, Sports Illustrated renamed its Sportsman Legacy Award to the Sports Illustrated's Muhammad Ali Legacy Award. The annual award was originally created in 2008 and honors former \"sports figures who embody the ideals of sportsmanship, leadership and philanthropy as vehicles for changing the world. \" Ali first appeared on the magazine's cover in 1963 and went on to be featured on numerous covers during his storied career. As a world champion boxer, social activist, and pop culture icon, Ali was the subject of numerous creative works including books, films, music, video games, TV shows, and other. Muhammad Ali was often dubbed the world's \"most famous\" person in the media. Several of his fights were watched by an estimated 1\u20132 billion viewers between 1974 and 1980, and his lighting of the torch at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was watched by an estimated 3. 5 billion viewers. Ali appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated on 37 different occasions, second only to Michael Jordan. He also appeared on the cover of Time Magazine 5 times, the most of any athlete. In 2015, Harris Poll found that Ali was one of the three most recognizable athletes in the United States, along with Michael Jordan and Babe Ruth. On the set of Freedom Road Ali met Canadian singer-songwriter Michel (also known as Robert Williams, a co-founder of The Kindness Offensive), and subsequently helped create Michel's album entitled The First Flight of the Gizzelda Dragon and an unaired television special featuring them both. Ali was the subject of the British television program This Is Your Life in 1978 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Ali was featured in Superman vs. Muhammad Ali, a 1978 DC Comics comic book pitting the champ against the superhero. In 1979, Ali guest-starred as himself in an episode of the NBC sitcom Diff'rent Strokes. The show's title itself was inspired by the quote \"Different strokes for different folks\" popularized in 1966 by Ali, who also inspired the title of the 1967 Syl Johnson song \"Different Strokes\", one of the most sampled songs in pop music history. He also wrote several bestselling books about his career, including The Greatest: My Own Story and The Soul of a Butterfly. The Muhammad Ali effect, named after Ali, is a term that came into use in psychology in the 1980s, as he stated in The Greatest: My Own Story: \"I only said I was the greatest, not the smartest. \" According to this effect, when people are asked to rate their intelligence and moral behavior in comparison to others, people will rate themselves as more moral, but not more intelligent than others. When We Were Kings, a 1996 documentary about the Rumble in the Jungle, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, and the 2001 biopic Ali garnered an Oscar nomination for Will Smith in the category of Best Actor for his portrayal of Ali. The latter film was directed by Michael Mann, and mixed reviews, with many critics praising Smith's portrayal of Ali. Prior to making the film, Smith rejected the role until Ali requested that he accept it. Smith said the first thing Ali told him was: \"Man, you're almost pretty enough to play me. \"In 2002, Ali was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the entertainment industry. His star is the only one to be mounted on a vertical surface, out of deference to his request that the name Muhammad\u2014a name he shares with the Islamic prophet\u2014not be walked upon. The Trials of Muhammad Ali, a documentary directed by Bill Siegel that focuses on Ali's refusal of the draft during the Vietnam War, opened in Manhattan on August 23, 2013. A made-for-TV movie called Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight, also in 2013, dramatized the same aspect of Ali's life.

A strong-tackling left-back, he joined Coventry City as an amateur whilst in the army without making any first-team appearances. In November 1952, he joined Birmingham City on a free transfer, making his league debut the following season on 19 April 1954 in a second division game against Nottingham Forest at St Andrew's which ended 2\u20132. The form of established full-back pairing Ken Green and Jeff Hall meant Allen was unable to establish himself as a regular in the side, making only 30 appearances in his first seven years at the club. When Green sustained the injury which eventually forced his retirement, Allen took his place and kept it until suffering a fractured skull in 1961. On his recovery, he could not regain his place in the side, mainly due to the form of Graham Sissons. After almost ten years at the club, and 165 games in all competitions, he joined Torquay United in January 1962, following in the footsteps of Birmingham teammate Gordon Astall who had made the same move six months earlier. He made his Torquay debut in a 4\u20132 home win over Hull City on 20 January 1962 and was ever-present for the remainder of the season.

Allen was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Ohio State University, where he met his future wife Sylvia, an artist and the sister of the Broadway actor Paul Lipson. He served in the U. S. Navy during World War II. Allen began his radio career at the OSU station, WOSU, and also worked for a commercial station in Columbus. The couple then moved to New York City, where Allen began his long tenure as announcer at WQXR radio in 1947. His connection with the Metropolitan Opera began in 1973 when he served as the backup for Milton Cross who had been announcing the Met's Saturday afternoon broadcasts since their inception in 1931. In 1975, after Cross's sudden death, Allen took over as announcer for the Met and continued in the job until 2004.

He served as the Principal Investigator on the Apollo Program's Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, which significantly restricted the possible range of spatial variation of the strength of the gravitational interaction. Alley was a PhD student of Robert Henry Dicke. Alley\u2019s goal was nothing less than understanding quantum mechanics, gravitation, and relativity. His lifelong research interests included experimental and theoretical questions about the foundations of gravitational and quantum physics. Alley developed some of the earliest important laboratory tests of Albert Einstein's theories of relativity. In recent years he became known for alternative theories of gravitation. He was a physics professor at University of Maryland, College Park, emeritus since 2008, until his death on 24 February 2016. Professor C. O. Alley served as the first chairman of the Lunar Ranging Experiment team. He was the Principal Investigator (PI) for the Apollo 11 laser ranging retro-reflector (LR3) experiment, deployed on the moon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969. In addition to the gravitational interaction results mentioned above, the experiment measured the orbit of the moon to centimeter accuracy\u2014and still produces data to this day. For this work he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Award in 1973; was designated by the Maryland Academy of Sciences, for their 1976 Bicentennial Exhibit, as one of two outstanding 20th Century Scientists; and received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Richmond in 1978. Some additional accomplishments of Professor Alley, his graduate students, the Quantum Electronics Research and Lunar Ranging Experiment Teams, support staff, and numerous collaborators include: Surveyor 7 laser beam pointing tests in preparation for the Apollo 11 experiment and visual detection of laser beams from Earth, as well as subsequent lunar laser ranging on later Apollo missions Role in the commissioning of the Global Positioning System by contributing to the calculations that correct for time dilation in gravitational fields Conducting relativistic proper time experiments by flying caesium and rubidium atomic clocks in a Navy P3C aircraft over the Chesapeake Bay, to measure the effects of gravitational potential difference on their recorded proper times and comparing those times to ground clocks using short laser pulses Experiments in fundamental quantum mechanics with light quanta, including the first delayed-choice experiment in quantum mechanics First use of spontaneous parametric down conversion in quantum optics to exhibit entangled polarization quantum states of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm type (thesis of Alley\u2019s PhD student Yan Hua Shih) Direct measurements of possible difference in the one-way speed of light between the east-west and west-east directions on the rotating Earth, by flying atomic clocks between Christchurch, New Zealand, and Thule, GreenlandIn later years Alley collaborated in the study, development, and application of a new formulation of gravity as curved spacetime found by Professor Huseyin Yilmaz. They postulated that the correct understanding of the lunar laser ranging measurements, the behavior of clocks in a global positioning system, and many strong gravity field astrophysical phenomena\u2014such as gravitational radiation\u2014require the interactive N-body solutions of the Yilmaz Theory (or \"New Theory\"), which are not present in Einstein\u2019s General Relativity field equations.

He became notable for playing a unique mix of blues and modern jazz, both singing and playing piano. After moving to New York in 1956, he worked primarily in jazz settings, playing with jazz musicians like Stan Getz, Al Cohn, and Zoot Sims, along with producing numerous recordings. He is described as having been \"one of the finest songwriters in 20th-century blues. \" His songs were strongly dependent on evoking moods, with his individualistic, \"quirky\", and subtle ironic humor. His writing influence on R&B had well-known fans recording his songs, among them Pete Townshend, who recorded his \"Young Man Blues\" for the Who's Live At Leeds album in 1970. John Mayall was one of dozens who recorded his classic, \"Parchman Farm\", and Georgie Fame used many of Allison's songs. Others who recorded his songs included Leon Russell (\"I'm Smashed\") and Bonnie Raitt (\"Everybody's Crying' Mercy\"). The 1980s saw an increase in his popularity with new fans drawn to his unique blend of modern jazz. In the 1990s he began recording more consistently. Van Morrison, Georgie Fame and Ben Sidran collaborated with him on a tribute album, Tell Me Something: The Songs of Mose Allison. The Pixies wrote the song \"Allison\" as a tribute. Allison's music had an important influence on other artists, such as Jimi Hendrix, J. J. Cale, the Yardbirds, the Rolling Stones, Tom Waits, and Pete Townshend. He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Allison was born outside Tippo, Mississippi, on his grandfather's farm, known as the Island, \"because Tippo Bayou encircles it. \" He took piano lessons at 5, picked cotton, played piano in grammar school and trumpet in high school, and wrote his first song at 13. Allison attended the University of Mississippi for a while and then enlisted in the U. S. Army for two years. Shortly after mustering out, he enrolled at Louisiana State University, from which he graduated in 1952 with a Bachelor of Arts in English with a minor in philosophy. Allison received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from LSU in 2008. In 1956, Allison moved to New York City and launched his jazz career, performing with artists such as Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan, Al Cohn, Zoot Sims, and Phil Woods. His debut album, Back Country Suite, was issued by Prestige in 1957. He formed his own trio in 1958, with Addison Farmer on bass and Nick Stabulas on drums. It was not until 1963 that his record label allowed him to release an album entirely of vocals. Entitled Mose Allison Sings, it was a compilation of songs from his previous Prestige albums that paid tribute to artists of the Mojo Triangle: Sonny Boy Williamson (\"Eyesight to the Blind\"), Jimmy Rogers (\"That's All Right\"), and Willie Dixon (\"The Seventh Son\"). However, an original composition, with no connection other than the same title to \"Bukka\" White's 1940 \"Parchman Farm\", on the album brought him the most attention: \"Parchman Farm\". For more than two decades, \"Parchman Farm\" was his most requested song. He dropped it from his playlist in the 1980s because some critics felt it was politically incorrect. Allison explained in an interview, \"I don't do the cotton sack songs much anymore. You go to the Mississippi Delta and there are no cotton sacks. It's all machines and chemicals. \" Prestige tried to market Allison as a pop star, but Columbia and later Atlantic tried to market him as a blues artist. Because he sang blues, Jet magazine thought that he was black and wanted to interview him. His album The Way of the World, released in March 2010, was his first after a 12-year absence from the recording studio. In 2012, Allison was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in his hometown of Tippo. On January 14, 2013, he was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts, the nation's highest honor in jazz, in a ceremony at Lincoln Center in New York. Allison wrote some 150 songs. His performances were described as being \"delivered in a casual conversational way with a melodic southern accented tone that has a pitch and range ideally suited to his idiosyncratic phrasing, laconic approach and ironic sense of humour. \" It was said that Allison was a social critic before Bob Dylan and a music satirist before Randy Newman. His music influenced many blues and rock artists, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, Tom Waits, the Yardbirds, John Mayall, J. J. Cale, the Who (who made \"Young Man Blues\" a staple of their live performances), and Georgie Fame, who described him as \"more important than Bob Dylan\". Blue Cheer recorded a version of his song \"Parchman Farm\" on their debut album, as did Cactus. The Yardbirds and the Misunderstood both recorded versions of his song \"I'm Not Talking\". Manfred Mann also recorded a version for the BBC. John Evans, keyboardist for the band Jethro Tull, was influenced by Allison's piano playing, which he described as \"so deceptively simple and impressive. \"Allison helped open the \"blues' racial divide, proving that a white man from rural Mississippi could hold his own in a traditionally black genre. \" The effort proved difficult, which he described in the lyrics of \"Ever Since I Stole the Blues,\" one of his most famous songs: \"Well the blues police from down in Dixieland / Tried to catch me with the goods on hand / Ever since the white boy stole the blues. \"His song \"Look Here\" was covered by the Clash on their album Sandinista! Leon Russell covered Allison's song \"Smashed!\" on his album Stop All That Jazz. Allison performed with Van Morrison, Georgie Fame, and Ben Sidran on the album Tell Me Something: The Songs of Mose Allison. Elvis Costello recorded \"Everybody's Cryin' Mercy\" for his album Kojak Variety and \"Your Mind Is on Vacation\" for King of America (bonus tracks). Dani Klein, of the Belgian music act Vaya Con Dios, recorded \"Mind on Vacation\" for the album Roots and Wings. Frank Black, of the band the Pixies, said that the song \"Allison\", from their album Bossanova, is about Mose Allison. The film The Whole Nine Yards begins with Allison's song \"I Don't Worry About a Thing\" during the opening credits. Americana singer-songwriter Greg Brown wrote and performed the song \"Mose Allison Played Here\" for his 1997 album Slant 6 Mind. The Dutch musician Herman Brood recorded several of Allison's songs, including \"Going to the City\", \"Stop This World\", \"Back on the Corner\", and \"Swinging Machine\". . Brood\u2019s band \u2018Wild Romance\u2019 was named from the line (\u201cI lost my mind in a wild romance\u201d) after hearing Mose Allison\u2019s recording (Local Color album, 1957) of Percy Mayfield\u2019s 1951 song \u2018Lost Mind\u2019. Allison received 3 Grammy nominations; 1983 and 1988 for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male, and in 2001 for Best Jazz Vocal Album. In 2013 Allison was awarded the NEA Jazzmasters Award at Lincoln Center. Mose married his wife, Audre, in 1949. They lived on Long Island, where they raised four children, including a daughter, Amy, who is a musician. Audre Allison said that when she first met Mose \"I could tell that he was someone who generated his own joy. \" She also said that \"Mose has always paid attention to what is happening in the world, and has always read voraciously both past and present histories. \"Allison died of natural causes on November 15, 2016, four days after his 89th birthday, at his home in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Allison was reported to have strong views about \"the domination of money over everything, the growing lack of empathy on the part of the powers-that-be for the population, wars and more wars, and an underlying hypocrisy in society\" and the arrogance of colonizers of the Americas. 1963 : Mose Allison Sings (Prestige 7279), reissued as Seventh Son (Prestige 10052), 1973; released on CD as Greatest Hits (OJC 6004) in 1988; a \"Rudy Van Gelder Remasters\" edition (Concord 30011) was released with three additional tracks in 2006 1966 : Down Home Piano (Prestige 7423; CD reissue: OJC 922, 1997) 1967 : Mose Allison Plays for Lovers (Prestige 7446) 1970 : The Best of Mose Allison (Atlantic 1542), released on CD with eight additional tracks in 1988 1971 : Retrospective (Columbia C-30564) 1994 : Allison Wonderland: The Mose Allison Anthology (Rhino R2-71689, two-CD set) 1994 : High Jinks!

A member of the Liberal Party, he represented the Montreal riding of Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce and served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1972 to 1979. As Solicitor General, Allmand introduced legislation that successfully abolished the death penalty in Canada in 1976. After leaving federal politics, Allmand took on the role of human rights activist, and led the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development and the World Federalist Movement-Canada. He briefly returned to politics by serving a term from 2005\u20132009 as a Montreal city councillor under G\u00e9rald Tremblay's Union Montreal party, becoming Vice President of the city council. Allmand died on December 7, 2016 from terminal brain cancer. William Warren Allmand was born in Montreal on September 19, 1932, and was raised in the Mile End neighbourhood. He had a Jesuit education at Loyola College in Montreal. He attended St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, and graduated in 1954 with a bachelor's degree in economics. Allmand studied civil law at McGill University, and graduated in 1957 with a bachelor of civil law degree. During his time at McGill, he was the chairman of the faculty of education in 1956\u201357. He was also a member of the university's Newman Club and played three years of varsity ice hockey for the McGill Redmen. After graduation, Allmand was admitted into the Quebec bar in 1958. He also earned certificates in comparative law at the University of Paris and at the Institute of Comparative Law. In the 1965 federal election, Allmand ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in the Montreal riding of Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce, and was elected to the Parliament of Canada. He would serve his constituency for over 30 years, being re-elected in every subsequent election before stepping down in 1997. As a backbencher, Allmand was a strong advocate for stronger gun laws in Canada, supporting regulations on all Canadian gun owners and limiting access to all guns, including those for hunting. In 1971, he proposed a bill to only permit government stores to sell guns. The bill also proposed an application process which included a waiting period during which the gun purchase was publicly listed to allow anyone to object. Allmand also proposed requiring gun owners to compile annual reports on their gun use and the condition of the gun, and to return their guns to the government when no longer used. Allmand continued to advocate for gun control laws upon his appointment to cabinet. In 1967, after Charles de Gaulle said \"Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre\" while on a state visit to Canada during Expo 67, Allmand sent a message to Paul Martin Sr. , the External Affairs Minister, that the rest of the trip must be cancelled. Allmand was sworn into the Privy Council on November 27, 1972 when he succeeded Jean-Pierre Goyer as Solicitor General for Pierre Trudeau, a post he held until September 13, 1976. Serving in the aftermath of the October Crisis, he testified before the Keable commission. In 1976, Allmand signed a warrant requested by Michael Dare, the Director-General of Royal Canadian Mounted Police Security Service, to authorize them to intercept the mail of a Toronto couple. The couple were suspected of conspiring with the Japanese Red Army, possibly to attack the upcoming 1976 Summer Olympics. After the Department of Justice advised Allmand it was a violation of the Post Office Act, it was cancelled in December 1976, nine months after it had been granted. In December 1976, Allmand was Solicitor General when Leonard Peltier was extradited to the United States. According to Allmand, the Federal Bureau of Investigation submitted false information to the Canadian government, including an affidavit from a woman with mental disorders who claimed to be Peltier's girlfriend. In 1977, after Allmand was no longer Solicitor General, he testified before the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP (the McDonald Commission) that the RCMP had advised him that it was legal for them to break into buildings to conduct warrantless searches as long as they did not take anything. Allmand would later state that the RCMP had been dishonest in withholding information from him and other solicitors general. After Trudeau's Liberals upgraded their minority government to a majority in the 1974 federal election, they had more leeway to act on abolishing capital punishment. In 1973, Liberals had renewed the provisions of Bill C-168, passed by Lester B. Pearson's minority government in 1968, which imposed a five-year moratorium on the use of the death penalty. With a majority behind them, Allmand and Trudeau, both ardent abolitionists, prepared to go further than Pearson had gone and decided to try and abolish the death penalty altogether. Allmand felt it was hypocritical to have the law on the books when Parliament had commuted every death sentence since 1962. He also felt that it was illegitimate to grant the Cabinet and the judiciary the power over an individual person's ultimate fate, noting that it is not in line with the values held by Canadian society. Because of these views, Canada's official hangman called for his resignation. In 1976 Allmand tabled Bill C-84, An Act to Amend the Criminal Code in Relation to the Punishment for Murder and Certain Other Serious Offences, the bill that would remove the death penalty from the Criminal Code and abolish its use in Canada. A sentence of life imprisonment with no chance of parole for a minimum of 25 years was substituted instead. 119 parliamentarians spoke for or against the bill over the course of the debate, with members of both the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties divided in their support of the bill. Opponents of the bill cited recent polling that 70% of Canadians supported capital punishment and called on the government to call a national referendum on the issue. Other opponents accused Allmand and Trudeau of proposing the bill now so that it would not expire before the next federal election in 1979 and risk costing the Liberals votes. Almost all opponents thought that the death penalty was a necessary response to terrorism, insurrection, and other serious crimes. Former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker argued that after the Munich massacre, passing Bill C-84 was sending the wrong message in the lead-up to the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. In response to the calls for referendum, including a motion for a national plebiscite by Alberta MP Gordon Towers, Allmand argued that the role of MPs was to deliberate in the House of Commons, make up their own minds, and then vote. He also argued that representative democracy necessarily excluded plebiscites, because then it would open the door to plebiscites on a variety of serious and controversial issues. In order not to risk the fall of the government over the bill given its contentious nature, Allmand and Trudeau agreed that the final vote would be a free vote. Despite the Liberal majority in the House of Commons, it only narrowly passed Bill C-84, 131 to 124. A year after the vote, Allmand remarked in a speech delivered to Amnesty International, that \"Capital punishment, simply because it is immoral and useless, must be fought and defeated if we are to become a world society in which our descendants can live in peace and justice. \" After being Solicitor General, Allmand continued to serve in the cabinet of Pierre Trudeau as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development from September 14, 1976 to September 15, 1977. While the Minister of Indian Affairs, Allmand was seen as particularly sensitive to the need to use appropriate language and have equitable relations with Indigenous Peoples in Canada. By taking the treaties with Indigenous Peoples at face value and extending the benefit of doubt to the people subject to the treaties, Allmand extended the rule of law to Indigenous witnesses in a largely unprecedented manner. Unlike his predecessor Judd Buchanan, who referred to the land claims and demands for Indigenous self-government proposed by the Dene people in the Dene Declaration in the aftermath of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry as \"goobledegook\", Allmand expressed public sympathy for their political demands of the Dene and the M\u00e9tis. He was seemingly about to reach a land claim settlement agreement which would have granted much of the desired political autonomy when he was replaced by Hugh Faulkner in fall 1977. Faulkner backed away from the concessions that Allmand had made such as control over natural resources, instead proposing a cash settlement and land allotments similar to Indian reserves. This new position was criticized by the Dene and M\u00e9tis leaders, and talks would not resume until 1981. His final cabinet post was as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs from September 16, 1977 until June 3, 1979, when the Liberals were defeated and Progressive Conservative Joe Clark formed government after the 1979 federal election. During the negotiations leading up to the patriation of the Constitution of Canada, Allmand, frequently suggested to his caucus colleagues, including those on the committee overseeing patriation, that the rights of Indigenous Peoples should be explicitly protected in any new constitution. Allmand's support lent credibility to the Indigenous cause, since he was a former Indian Affairs minister and longtime cabinet minister. Ultimately, Allmand voted against the Constitution Act, 1982 because of his opposition to the inclusion of the notwithstanding clause in Section 33 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that allowed certain rights to be overridden by the national and provincial legislatures. He opposed Section 59 of the act, which delayed the implementation of Section 23 minority language education rights in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Quebec until a time chosen by the Quebec National Assembly. After this vote, Allmand would never hold a Liberal cabinet position again. During Brian Mulroney's tenure as prime minister, Allmand held numerous Official Opposition critic portfolios. He was critic for Employment from October 1984 to September 1990. In 1988, conservative Catholics attacked Allmand for being \"anti-life\" for voting against amendments to the Criminal Code that would have criminalized abortion in Canada. Allmand, himself a Catholic, defended himself, saying that while he personally opposed the act of abortion, he did not believe abortion should be included in criminal law. Allmand was critic for arms control and disarmament as well as critic for Official Languages from 1990 to 1992, and critic for Immigration from 1992 to 1993. During this time, Allmand, who was the chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet, hosted the 14th Dalai Lama's first visit to Canada in 1990. In 1995, he gained notoriety for voting against Minister of Finance Paul Martin's budget, as he was opposed to spending cuts that were deeper than promised during the 1993 election and because it did not cancel the Goods and Services Tax. As a result, Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien removed him from his position as chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice, a position he held from January 17, 1994 to February 2, 1996, although he remained in the Liberal caucus. Allmand said that Martin's budget cuts \"broke traditional Liberal principles\" and his willingness to vote against his own party's majority government emboldened other Liberal MPs to follow suit, such as John Nunziata and Dennis Mills. He retired before the 1997 election after Chr\u00e9tien appointed him president of the Montreal-based International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development (later renamed Rights and Democracy) to replace Ed Broadbent, its first president. Allmand served as the president of the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development from 1997 to 2002. During the 3rd Summit of the Americas, held in Quebec City in 2001, Allmand encouraged social activists boycotting the event to speak with governmental actors in order to collaboratively develop better policy. During his time at the centre, Allmand supported the work done on the International Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. In the leadup to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Allmand was an active participant in the negotiations via the Coalition for Peace in Ireland. During the negotiations, Allmand met Rosemary Nolan, whom he married in 2002. He also served as the international president of Parliamentarians for Global Action. In 2004, Allmand was elected President of the World Federalist Movement\u2013Canada, a position he held until his terminal illness led to his replacement in August 2016 by Walter Dorn. Allmand also served as a director of the Newman Centre of Montreal and CANADEM. In 2004, Allmand taught at McGill University as a visiting scholar at the Institute of Canadian Studies. In 2005, Allmand served as counsel for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group during the Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Maher Arar, and argued that Canada's national security agencies, especially the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, chose security over rights and were largely unaccountable when they did so. In November 2005, Allmand was elected to the Montreal city council seat as a member of the Union Montr\u00e9al party to represent Loyola, in the C\u00f4te-des-Neiges\u2013Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce borough. Allmand's primary motivation for joining was to help oversee the city's implementation of its charter of rights that he had helped draft. Although Allmand had been recruited by then mayor G\u00e9rald Tremblay for his party, he was not afraid to publicly criticize the mayor if he disagreed with city policy. Allmand voted against Tremblay's motion to change the name of Park Avenue to Avenue Robert Bourassa. During his time on the council, he criticized the lack of transparency in urban planning for projects in his seat of Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce, while Michael Applebaum was mayor. Although he had risen to become the Vice President of the Montreal City Council, he did not choose to run again in the 2009 Montreal municipal election. In 2011, Allmand supported the Canadian Boat for Gaza, part of the Freedom Flotilla II that sought to deliver supplies to Palestinians. In Fall 2013, Allmand joined Foundation Board of Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East. In 2014, Allmand defended a legal argument, on behalf of the World Federalist Movement \u2013 Canada, that challenged the Canadian government's implementation bill for the Convention on Cluster Munitions. He argued that a clause of the bill which gave Canada an explicit exemption in certain cases while participating in combined military operations with non-signatory allies such as the United States undermined the purpose of the convention. Allmand noted that Australia and New Zealand, two other American allies, had passed similar legislation without this exemption. Allmand was concerned that signing a treaty with the exception would encourage other countries to create their own exceptions. Allmand was diagnosed with a brain tumour in February 2016, and his condition worsened in October 2016. He then entered a palliative care centre at the Centre hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al's H\u00f4pital Notre-Dame, where he died on December 7, 2016, at the age of 84. Allmand's funeral was held at St. Patrick's Basilica on December 19. Allmand was survived by his wife, a son and two daughters. In 1977, Allmand was appointed Queen's Counsel for his contributions to the legal field. In 1990, the World Federalist Movement\u2013Canada honoured Allmand with its World Peace Award. In 2000, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for being \"committed to democracy and the pursuit of justice and fundamental freedoms. \" In June 2006, Bishop's University granted him a Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa at its convocation ceremony. In 1999, in a list that Allmand submitted to the Great Canadian Book of Lists, he listed abolishing the death penalty as one of Canada's twelve most significant political events. After his death, Denis Coderre, the Mayor of Montreal, announced that the flags at Montreal City Hall would be flown at half-mast in his honour. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a statement on Twitter saying that Allmand's \"legacy will live on in the enormous contributions he made to Canada as an MP and Minister. \" Allmand published at least three books during this career: Is there a future for progressive policies in Canada?

Allworth (1 December 1920 \u2013 20 October 2016) was an American historian specializing in Central Asia. Allwarth is widely regarded as the West\u2019s leading scholar on Central Asian studies. He extensively studied the various ethnic groups of the region, including Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Bukharan Jews. He wrote numerous books on the history of Central Asia. Edward A. Allworth was born on December 1, 1920, the son of Edward Allworth (1895\u20131966) and Ethel Walker. (His father received the Medal of Honor for service in France during World War I. ) He received his bachelor's degree from Oregon State University. He received a master's degree from the University of Chicago. In 1959, he received a Ph. D. from Columbia University. During World War II, Allworth served as a platoon leader, second lieutenant, and adjutant, in the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division of the US Army, in the Normandy Invasion and the division's battles thereafter through the Allied World War II victory in Northern Europe. Allworth taught a wide variety of courses on Central Asian studies at Columbia University. In 1984, he established the Department of Middle East Languages and Cultures to focus on the study of contemporary Central Asia. He published numerous books on the history of Central Asia. These include Uzbek Literary Politics (1964), Central Asian Publishing and the Rise of Nationalism (1965), Central Asia: A Century of Russian Rule (1967), The Nationality Question in Soviet Central Asia (1973), Nationality Group Survival in Multiethnic States (1977), The Modern Uzbeks: From the Fourteenth Century to the Present (1990), The Tatars of Crimea: Return to the Homeland (1998), and The Preoccupations of Abdalrauf Fitrat, Bukharan Nonconformist: An Analysis and List of His Writings (2000). Allworth was Emeritus Professor of Turko-Soviet Studies at Columbia University. He was founding director at Columbia of both the Program on Soviet Nationality Problems (1970) and the Center for the Study of Central Asia (1984). Allworth was also editor of the Central Asia book series at Duke University Press. Allworth extensively studied the Chagatai language. He was fluent in Uzbek and Uighur. Allworth died on October 20, 2016, in New York City. In November 2016, the Central Eurasia Studies Society posthumously awarded Allworth with the CESS Lifetime Service to the Field Award. Doctoral student Shahrbanou Tadjbakhsh remembered: Professor Allworth always defended cultural history during the Cold War when the tendency was to study strategy and weapons, as well as during the post-Soviet period when the focus was on democracy building and economic transition models. When the Central Asian countries gained independence in the early 1990s, while some students dropped out of the Ph. D. track to follow the appeal of rapid lucrative employment in oil companies, governments and radio stations beaming propaganda to the region, he kept a handful of us at bay and steeped us in the writings of the early 20th century reformist writer Abdalrauf Fitrat, and the study of Chagatay, the 15th century pre-Uzbek language. Allworth donated his extensive collection of books on the languages of the region to the New York Public Library.

He appeared in over 300 films. He was most known for his roles in urban westerns and action pictures. He was the brother of actor Fernando Almada. Almada was born in Huatabampo, Sonora. Apart from acting he was also a director, writer and film producer. He began his artistic career in Mexico during the 1930s. He has appeared in over 200 films, with his first being Madre Querida in 1935. In this film he acted alongside his brother Fernando as children as an extra. He would not appear in another film again until a few decades later. Almada moved from his home city of Huatabampo to Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n and to Guadalajara, Jalisco, where he lived for many years until he settled down in Mexico City. Almada was born to a family connected to the film industry, and was exposed to film shootings from an early age and, when he moved to Mexico City, he began working at a nightclub called Cabaret Master that was owned by his father. When his brother Fernando decided to take up acting, Mario decided to become a film producer. He wrote his first film script in 1963. The Almada brothers had their own family-run production company that eventually dissolved due to financial troubles from lack of profit. In 1965 Mario played the role of Bruno Rey in the film Los Jinetes de la Bruja, in which the Almada brothers produced and Fernando acted as protagonist. Rey was injured during the shooting and Mario agreed to take his place. At the end of the decade, Mario and Fernando were starting off as film protagonists in western films such as Emiliano Zapata. The following year (1969), Mario acted as protagonist alongside Julio Alem\u00e1n. The film concerns a man (the Tunco Maclovio) who is haunted by the ghost of his friend Juan Mariscal, who died at the age of 15 from an accidental shooting by Tunco Maclovio. This film won him a Diosa de Plata as \u201cBest Co-starring Actor\u201d. Almada then filmed Aquellos a\u00f1os, Por eso, Cazador de asesinos, El puerto maldito, La viuda negra, Divinas palabras, El valle de los miserables, among others. He returned with La viuda negra and was nominated for an Ariel for his performance Although according to the official website of the Ariel, this nomination was not made until 1984, although La Viuda Negra was released in 1977. In the 1970s Almada worked on a large number of films of the most diverse types and genres. There were times in which Mexican cinema was forced to seek new paths. Private film production almost disappeared and turned (or intended to be) progressive. It was a time of change in which Almada wanted to secure his place in film as an actor with multiple facets. He worked with westerns (Los doce malditos, 1972); historical reconstructions (Aquellos a\u00f1os, 1972); eschatology tapes and alarmism (La isla de los hombres solos, 1973); in second versions (Los desarraigados, 1975, based on the eponymous film of Gilberto Gazc\u00f3n 1958). He agreed to become co-star alongside Vicente Fernandez (El arracadas, 1977); in drug trafficking based films (La banda del carro rojo, 1976); in literary adaptations (Divinas palabras, 1977); ranchera melodramas, (Mariachi, 1976), and urban melodramas (Para usted jefa, 1979). In his more than 200 films the subject of righteous revenge is something that remains as a constant, and especially in movies directed by Pedro Galindo such as 'Los desalmados (1970); Todo el horizonte para morir (1970); El pistolero del diablo (1973); in 1981 he reinforced this trend with Cazador de asesinos directed by Jose Luis Urquieta, which is based on the ballad of the same name by the band Cadetes de Linares. During the 1970s, Almada's films were box office successes. In this decade, however, he changed his usual role of a hero/cowboy figure to a recurring villain in urban action films, highlighted in Peor Que Las Fieras alongside Rogelio Guerra and Yolanda Li\u00e9vana. Moreover, like in the end of the 1960s, he made another change, since he began to star without his brother in many of his films during the 1980s. In addition, he worked on films dealing with other subjects, such as La viuda negra (1977) and La fuga del rojo (1982). Almada recognizes that: \u201cEs dif\u00edcil quedar satisfecho con el trabajo que uno hace, y siempre espera que la siguiente pel\u00edcula sea mejor, aunque la gente lo que pide es acci\u00f3n. Hice pel\u00edculas de otro g\u00e9nero como Divinas palabras, La india y no tuvieron \u00e9xito, la gente no las fue a ver, prefieren la acci\u00f3n y eso ha sostenido a la industria. \u201d [\"It is difficult to be satisfied with the work you do, and you always hope that the next movie is better, but the people want action. I made films in other genres such as Divinas palabras, La india and they did not succeed, people did not go to see them, they prefer action and that has sustained the industry. \"]In 1987 he was again nominated for an Ariel for the second time with his starring role as Chido Guan in the film Tacos de Oro, the story of a football team who are about to lose until Chido Guan (Almada) helps them win. Again, the film was shot in 1985, but the Mexican Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not nominate the film until 1987. In 1990 Almada collaborated with Los Tigres del Norte again in the film La Camioneta Gris. Previously in 1978, Almada, alongside his brother Fernando, had collaborated with the band in the film La Banda del Carro Rojo alongside Pedro Infante Jr. From 1997 to 2001, he played an important role in the Grupo Exterminador album \"Narco Corridos 2\" where he appeared on the cover and also conducted dialogues for most of the album's songs. In the 1997 album El Chile Pelaiz he reappeared on the cover. In 1999 he created dialogues for the track \"Contrabando en los huevos\" and participated in the video that was banned by the SCT and his last appearance for the band was on the album \"Reuni\u00f3n de perrones\" where he appeared with other Mexican actors. For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Almada has been inducted into the Paseo de las Luminarias in Mexico City. Almada's films continued with themes of drug trafficking and violence. He played the role of a godfather in the 2006 film Bajo la misma luna. The film is about a boy who crosses the Mexican-American Border in order to reunite with his mother. The film's name has been changed to La Misma Luna since January 2007 and was officially released in M\u00e9xico on September 7, 2007 and in the United States on September 28, 2007. In 2008 Almada played a secondary role during the second season of the Mexican television series El Pantera, playing the role of Don Almagro. In 2010 he appeared on the Narco satire El Infierno, made by Luis Estrada. He played the role of the drug trafficker known as \"El Texano\", an intermediary between the highland narcotics producers and the people of Jose Reyes. It is an unusual role for him to take on in his career full of mafia-related films, where he often plays an incorruptible police officer or a peaceful civilian who ends up seeking revenge. Almada died in his sleep at the age of 94 on October 4, 2016.

He was the first Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) Rookie of the Year in 1979 and competed in the 1981 Indianapolis 500, finishing 11th. He made 57 CART & USAC Champ Car starts in his career. His best race finish of third came 3 times and he was the 1981 CART Championship runner-up, putting in a winless but consistent season for Penske Racing, his only effort with a top-level team. He returned to his own team the next year and struggled until leaving Champ Car following the 1984 Sanair Super Speedway race. Alsup made his CART debut at the Arizona Republic/Jimmy Bryan 150 at Phoenix International Raceway driving the #41 WASP Racing Mclaren-Offenhauser for WASP Racing starting twenty fourth (last) and finishing eleventh. He attempted to qualify for the Indianapolis 500, first driving the #67 WASP Racing McLaren-Offenhauser, but the car was not fast enough to make a qualifying run. He then attempted the #19 Sta-On Eagle 74-Offenhauser for Gehlhausen Racing but the engine failed. The final car he attempted to qualify was the #68 CAM 2 Motor Oil Penske PC7-Cosworth DFX for Team Penske. He qualified for the race but USAC officials ruled that the car used the engine from Penske teammate Bobby Unser's car and Alsup was disqualified. He drove the remainder of the CART season for WASP Racing. He had a best finish of ninth in the second heat of the Trenton Indy at Trenton Speedway, the Kent Oil 150 at Watkins Glen International, the first heat of the Norton Twin 125s and the Gould Grand Prix, the latter two at Michigan International Speedway, and finished the season fifteenth in points to win the first CART Rookie of the Year Award. In 1980 Alsup purchased the inventory of WASP Racing and started his own team called Alsup Racing, Alsup driving the #41 Polaroid Time Zero Penske PC7-Cosworth DFX. He started the season by finishing sixth in the season opening Dastun Twin 200 at Ontario Motor Speedway. He failed to qualify for the Indianapolis 500, rebounded to finish third at the Red Roof Inns 150 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, and finished the season seventh in points, earning him the CART Most Improved Driver Award. In 1981 he drove for Team Penske in a Norton-Spirit sponsored car alongside teammates Bobby Unser and Rick Mears. Driving for Penske in the #7 A. B. Dick Penske PC9B-Cosworth DFX and for himself in the #41 Polaroid Time Zero Penske PC7-Cosworth DFX he had a best finish of third at the Norton Michigan 500 at Michigan International Speedway where he led for three laps. He also finished third at the Los Angeles Times 500 at Riverside International Raceway and at the AB Dick Tony Bettenhausen 200 at Wisconsin State Fairgrounds Park Speedway. He ended the season with a career best second in points in the CART standings but it wasn't enough to keep his ride with TEAM Penske, and he was released from the team at the end of the season. In 1982 he was back to driving for himself using the #2 A. B. Dick Penske PC9B-Cosworth DFX and had a best finish of fourth at the Stroh's 200 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. He dropped to eleventh in points for the season. In 1983 he began working with Argo Racing Cars driving the #11 Alsup Racing/Indy Car Annual Argo JM-15-Cosworth DFX. He failed to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 and soon started driving a March 83C-Cosworth DFX. He scored no points that year.

He served as the general secretary of the Communist Party of Nicaragua for a quarter century. Altamirano was born in Chinandega on February 27, 1934. His parents were Angel Maria Altamirano Gutierrez and Mercedes Perez Altamirano. He studied up to the fourth grade at the Escuela Superior de Varones in Chinandega. In 1956 Altamirano was jailed thrice, during the wave of repression that took place after the killing of Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda. In the same year he began organizing a union for mechanics and metal workers in Managua. He became a member of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN) in 1959. In 1960 he became a member of the leadership of the Federacion de Trabajadores de Managua. In 1961 he founded the Socialist Youth of Nicaragua, the PSN youth wing. He became a member of the central leadership of the Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo (independiente) trade union centre in 1962. He stayed in exile in Cuba between April 1963 and March 1964, after which he left for studies in Moscow. He took part a split in PSN in early 1967, and took part in founding the Socialist Workers Party of Nicaragua (POSN) in October 1967. He spent eight month in jail in 1968. Upon his release he was named general secretary of POSN. Taking over the control of POSN, he expelled the older leadership. In December 1970 POSN held its constitutive congress, adopting the name Communist Party of Nicaragua and electing Altamirano as its general secretary. Under Altamirano's leadership the Communist Party took an anti-Sandinista stance, isolating itself from the broader revolutionary movement. Within the party a personality cult around Altamirano began to emerge. In October 1971 he founded the newspaper Avance, and became its chief editor. In 1973 he founded the Central de Acci\u00f3n y Unificaci\u00f3n Sindical trade union centre. He was the coordinator of the United People's Movement (Movimiento Pueblo Unido). At the time of the fall of Somoza, Altamirano was imprisoned. He had been arrested in April 1979 and sentenced to six months imprisonment. He was released after the victory of the revolution on July 19, 1979. After the revolution, Altamirano sought to push the political process into a leftward direction. CAUS organized a strike on factory workers in March 1980, provoking reaction from the new Sandinista government. Altamirano and other CAUS leaders were arrested. He was accused of participating in a CIA destabilization plot. Altamirano was arrested along with other Communist Party and CAUS leaders on October 21, 1981 and sentenced to seven months imprisonment for violating the Public Order Law. He was recognized as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. Altamirano was elected deputy of the National Opposition Union (UNO) in the 1990 elections. Within UNO, Altamirano was particularly close to Virgilio Godoy. Altamirano stood as candidate for president in the 1996 Nicaraguan general election. He obtained 4,802 votes (0. 27% of the national vote). After 1996 Altamirano largely retired from public affairs. However, he remained as the leader of the party, albeit he struggled with health issues late in life. Altamirano died in early 2016, but his death was kept secret for almost a month.

After his retirement from sports he worked as a television commentator. Rudi Altig was born in Mannheim, Baden, Germany, an area which had produced good track riders. He began racing in 1952, following his older brother, Willi. The brothers teamed for madison and other two-man races, becoming the best in the country. The British promoter, Jim Wallace, booked Altig to ride with Hans Jaroszewicz at a meeting on Herne Hill velodrome in Good Friday in 1956. He said: What a pair they made! They just about slaughtered a top-class field of international riders, with all our best home lads. Only Michel Rousseau, later that year to become world sprint champion, was able to take a points sprint from them. That was in the first sprint, too; thereafter the German pair gained not only every sprint for points but every prime [lap prize] as well . . . They went on to Coventry [another meeting held over Easter] and did much the same thing, winning everything in which they rode, so classy was their performance. Altig became national sprint champion in 1957 and 1958. Then Karly Ziegler, a coach, took over his preparation when he joined the Endspurt Mannheim club and Altig became a pursuiter. He won the 1959 national pursuit championship and won the madison championship with his brother. Later that year he beat many of the world's best pursuiters to become world champion in Amsterdam. Altig was allowed by the Union Cycliste Internationale to turn professional in 1960 within a year of his world championship. He rode his first professional six-day, in Denmark, that winter. Wallace said: No man ever settled down better or quicker to a pro career than the able Altig. In the hurly-burly world of indoor track racing. Rudi never seemed a novice. Settling down at once, tearing strips off established stars, he soon started to fill indoor tracks which had long forgotten the welcome sight of a 'house full' sign. He brought back the biggest winter racing boom to Germany for many years, reminiscent of the balmy pre-war days. With seven tracks at home - more than in the rest of Europe - Altig had a busy time and was soon in the big money. He won the world pursuit championship in 1960 and 1961 and won 62 races on the track. He won 22 six-day races, particularly in Germany, including four in Cologne and Dortmund. He never rode the Giro di Lombardia because it clashed with the start of the winter season on the track. He said: I rode the track because I could win money. If I hadn't been able to win money on the track, I wouldn't have travelled all the velodromes of the world to ride six-days. Now, riders are better paid and they don't need to hammer themselves on the road and the track. We, in our era, we did everything to try to win money. Modern times are different, you have to understand that. You can't compare the two eras. But I don't regret ours. Altig, who was 1. 80 m (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighed 80 kg (180 lb), sprinted on the track on 52 or 53 \u00d7 16 and rode pursuits on 52 \u00d7 15. \"He gave his bikes as hard a time as he gave his adversaries,\" said the writer, Olivier Dazat. Altig started his professional career as a track rider; it was Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani who persuaded him his future was on the road. Altig agreed because fame on the road would give him better contracts on the track. He won the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and three of its stages in 1962. He led the general classification for five days in his first Tour de France that same season, winning three stages and the points competition, and finishing 31st. He won his first classic in 1964, the Tour of Flanders after riding 60 km alone and winning by four minutes. In the same year he won the German National Road Race. In 1965 he finished second to Englishman Tom Simpson in the professional road championship in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain. Simpson said: I could not accept that Altig could beat me. Going round the back of the circuit we came to a gentleman's agreement. Both of us had worked hard in our little break and therefore we each deserved an equal chance of victory. We agreed to separate when we reached the one kilometre to go board and ride in side by side. Altig was quite happy about this for I am sure he thought he could put it across me. So there we were, two gentlemen virtually fighting a duel over the last kilometre. I was glad that Altig had accepted my proposal for it was the fairest way out. I have always regarded him as a great rider and his showing that day did nothing to make me change my mind. But the world title was not denied for long: he won the 1966 championship not too far away from his home, at the N\u00fcrburgring. There was controversy because Altig had been helped by Gianni Motta, riding that day for Italy but normally Altig's companion in the Molteni team. The concern was quickly overshadowed by the refusal of the first three riders to give urine samples for a drugs check. They were protesting at what they saw was the laxity with which tests were carried out and at what they considered restrictions on the way they prepared themselves. Altig said: \"We are professionals, not sportsmen. \" The three were disqualified and suspended but ten days later the Union Cycliste Internationale allowed the result to stand. Altig took three stages in that year's Tour, finishing 12th place overall, and two more in the Giro d'Italia, in which he came 13th. The second and final classic win came in the 1968 Milan\u2013San Remo. He also took two stages of that year's Vuelta, finishing 18th overall. In 1969 he finished 9th in the Giro, and won the prologue individual time trial of the Tour de France. Altig rode his first Tour as a domestique and as team sprinter for Jacques Anquetil. The two developed a rocky relationship in the Tour of Spain that hardened when Altig took the yellow jersey early in the Tour de France. Anquetil criticised him because his team would have to ride at the front and chase every attack to protect a rider too heavy to keep his lead through the mountains. The two never became close until they rode for different teams. That same year the two were paired for the Trofeo Baracchi, a 111 km two-man time-trial in Italy. The writer Ren\u00e9 de Latour wrote: Generally in a race of the Barrachi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints of no more than 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check - and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through. . . Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport - something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front - and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did not this just once but dozens of times. Anquetil reached the stadium where the race finished and hit a pole. He was helped away with staring eyes and with blood streaming from a cut to his head. The pairing nevertheless won by nine seconds. Altig said: \"Jacques wasn't happy [during the race], it didn't please him at all, but I wanted us to win. So I got him by the saddle, I got him by the shorts, and hop!. \" Altig became directeur sportif of the Puch-Wolber team when he stopped racing and worked for five years as national coach. He was a television commentator. He said of the American rider, Lance Armstrong: \"He is a tyrant who exploits his team-mates without leaving them the least initiative. \" Of his fellow German, Jan Ullrich, he said he would do better to talk less about what he was going to do and get on and do it. He died on 11 June 2016 in Remagen, Germany, as a result of cancer.

In New York, where he married his first wife Elizabeth Altman, he became a graduate student in psychology in the laboratory of Hans-Lukas Teuber, earning a PhD. ,in 1959 from New York University.

During his career, he collaborated closely with his second wife, Shirley A. Bayer. From the early 1960s to 2016, he published many articles in peer-reviewed journals, books, monographs, and online free books that emphasized developmental processes in brain anatomy and function. Joseph Altman discovered adult neurogenesis, the creation of new neurons in the adult brain, in the 1960s. As an independent investigator at MIT, his results were largely ignored, by his account, in favor of Pasko Rakic's findings that neurogenesis is limited to pre-natal development. By the late 1990s, a paradigm shift had occurred. The fact that the brain can create new neurons even into adulthood was rediscovered by Elizabeth Gould in 1999, leading it to be one of the hottest fields in neuroscience.

They married in 1959 and were married for 47 years, until his death in 2006. It was after their marriage that Kathryn Reed Altman shifted her focus from the pursuit of an acting career to an active and supportive role in facilitating her husband's film career and also to their children, which at that time were four. She had a daughter, Konni, from her first marriage to Tommy Pederson. Robert had three children from his previous two marriages: a daughter and two sons, Christine, Stephan, and Michael. They later had two sons together, Robert and Matthew. Altman would frequently travel to the locations of her husband's film sets that were located in various places around the globe, bring their children along with her. Altman became a prolific archivist watchfully documenting her husband's film career. She would frequently assist him on his films sets; although none of these roles were listed in the films' credits. She filled 32 photo albums with thousands of pictures of their professional and family related activities. Her documentation was the basis of her book Altman that was co-authored with Giulia D'Argnolo Vallan. In 1965 her husband made the short film The Kathryn Reed Story, for her as a birthday gift; which is now part the Robert Altman Collection at the University of Michigan's Special Collections Library.

He entered the Uruguayan Military Academy in 1940 and graduated as an officer of the cavalry regiment (1946-59). He became chief of the Republican Guard in Montevideo in 1962. In 1971, he was promoted to general and then named chief of the Combined Armed Forces Command that ran the counterinsurgency operation against the Tupamaros (urban guerrillas). When the military seized power in 1973 Uruguayan coup d'\u00e9tat, \u00c1lvarez became permanent secretary of the new Consejo de Seguridad Nacional (National Security Council). In 1978, he became commander in chief of the army. After Uruguay voted for a return to democracy in a referendum in 1980, the Consejo de Seguridad Nacional named \u00c1lvarez transitional president on September 1, 1981. Continuing the repression against labor unions, he lost more popular support and also the support of the majority of the military. He agreed to the holding of legislative and presidential elections in November 1984, which had been preceded by internal party elections in 1982. When Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti of the Colorado Party won the presidential election, \u00c1lvarez resigned (on February 12, 1985). Rafael Addiego, President of the Supreme Court, then took office as interim president until Sanguinetti was sworn in on March 1. It might be added that while Alvarez did not look favourably upon Jorge Sanguinetti's candidacy in 1984, in his last years found a slightly unlikely defender in Sanguinetti, who argued that the amnesty relating to the dictatorship of 1973-1985 should not be set aside to prosecute even the more overtly military and unpalatable figures such as \u00c1lvarez, who were prominent during that period. \u00c1lvarez's loss of support from the (relatively) more moderate members of the National Security Council in the run-up to the 1984 elections and his subsequent resignation invites scrutiny of the relationship between the Council, the military, and the constitutional party leaders. Some would argue that \u00c1lvarez's accession to the office of president in 1981 marked a high point of his power, which continued until his resignation. Others would argue that \u00c1lvarez's assumption of the permanent secretaryship of the National Security Council in 1973 marked the real point at which he gained what amounted to substantial executive powers. From whichever perspective, however, the fact remains that General \u00c1lvarez's public role as a military figure was set against the background of sizeable civilian participation in government in the 1973-1985. It is also the case that \u00c1lvarez was to some extent sidelined even during his Presidency. In a country such as Uruguay which had some tradition of civilian rule by decree (e. g. , during the Presidency of Gabriel Terra, whose Interior Minister Alberto Demicheli later became President in 1976), it is arguably not accurate to equate rule by decree with military rule, although these may at times coincide. Among the five individuals who became President of Uruguay in the civilian-military administration that lasted from 1973 to 1985, \u00c1lvarez, was, in fact, the only one to carry a military title. These five individuals were: Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry, Alberto Demicheli, Aparicio M\u00e9ndez, \u00c1lvarez, and Rafael Addiego. Some would argue that this fact is significant when assessing the degree of civilian participation in the regime. Others would argue that an unelected president backed by the military may sometimes merely constitute a cosmetic figurehead. Although he was covered by a 1986 amnesty, since the election to the presidency of Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez of the Frente Amplio in November 2004, there had been renewed calls for the prosecution of \u00c1lvarez for human rights abuses, for his part in Bordaberry's 1973 coup, and subsequent events. \u00c1lvarez's residence in Montevideo became the focal point for demonstrators protesting the disappearance of opponents of the 1973-1985 civilian-military administration in July 2006. Defenders of such protests could argue that \u00c1lvarez symbolizes some of the least attractive aspects of the dictatorship of 1973-1985. On the other hand, it may be accurately asserted that since \u00c1lvarez was the only serving military individual to serve as President in the five Presidencies of that period, such protests, whether justified or not, may serve to obscure the substantial civilian support for that administration by Colorado and Blanco politicians. From the point of view of those parties, therefore, such protests serve to deflect any focus upon the role exercised by prominent individuals in those parties during that regime. In December 2007 \u00c1lvarez was indicted for alleged human rights abuses during the dictatorship in which he played a prominent role. On October 22, 2009, he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for 37 counts of murder and human rights violations; however, he was not in court to hear the verdict as he was ill.

Nawabzada Mirza Jamiluddin Ahmad Khan was born to a literary family in Delhi, India on 20 January 1925. His father Amiruddin Ahmed Khan was Nawab of Loharu and his mother Syeda Jamila Baigum was direct descendant of Khwaja Mir Dard and was the fourth wife of Amiruddin Khan. Aali earned a BA in Economics from Anglo Arabic College, Delhi in 1944. In 1947 after the partition of India, Aali migrated to Karachi, Pakistan on 13 August 1947 with his family and started his career as an assistant in the Ministry of Commerce. In 1951, Aali passed CSS (civil service of Pakistan) examination and joined Pakistan Taxation Service. He was also the Officer on Special Duty at President House from 1959 to 1963. Aali joined the National Bank of Pakistan in 1967 and remained its vice president until his retirement in 1988. In 1971, he obtained an FEL and LLB (law) degrees from University of Karachi. Jamiluddin Aali was also former member of the Pakistan Peoples Party and was compelled to contest the 1977 National Assembly elections from NA-191, but lost to Munawwar Hasan of Jamaat-e-Islami. In 1997, Aali was elected as the member of the Senate for a six-year term with support of Muttahida Qaumi Movement. Jamiluddin Aali was never very clear or comfortable with answering the question as to why he drifted briefly into politics. Was it due to his impulsive behavior for fame and recognition? He would usually evade this question and never could answer it comfortably and clearly during his lifetime. Aali started composing poetry at an early age and wrote many books as well as songs. He wrote the song \"Jeevay Jeevay Pakistan\" during 1965 Indo-Pak war which became highly popular. The song was sung by Shahnaz Begum with music arranged by Sohail Rana and was originally released on 14 August 1971 by PTV. During International Women's Year (1976), he wrote the song \"Hum Maain, Hum Behnain, Hum Baitiyan\". Aali also wrote a song \"Jo Nam Wohi Pehchan, Pakistan\" at the request of former Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1986. He was also the writer of the song \"Mera Inam Pakistan\" by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Jamiluddin Aaali was married in 1944 to Tayyba Bano. He had three sons and two daughters. Aali was suffering from diabetes and respiratory illness and was admitted in a hospital in Karachi. He died of heart attack on 23 November 2015 in Karachi. His Namaz-I-Janazah was held in the mosque \"Tooba\" in DHA, Karachi. He was laid to rest in an army graveyard Bizerta Lines, Karachi on 23 November 2015. Jamiluddin Aali took over as honorary secretary of the Anjuman-i Taraqqi-i Urdu (Association for the Promotion of Urdu language) in 1962 after the death of Baba-e-Urdu Maulvi Abdul Haq and played a key role there for many years, along with Farman Fatehpuri, to ensure that the association survives and grows. Aali could also be given credit for playing a major role at the Urdu Lughat Board (Urdu Dictionary Board) when this 22-volume Urdu dictionary was being developed in Pakistan.

Aantjes a jurist by occupation, was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 26 May 1959 after the general election of 1959. He served as the Parliamentary leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the House of Representatives from 22 June 1971 until 30 November 1972, during the period when Barend Biesheuvel the Leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Aantjes became Leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party and Parliamentary leader on 7 March 1973 and served until 25 May 1977 when the became the Parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal in the House of Representatives of the Netherlands from 19 December 1977 until 7 November 1978 when he resigned both his positions. Willem Aantjes was born on 16 January 1923 in Bleskensgraaf in the Netherlands Province of South Holland. His father, Klaas Aantjes', was alderman in Bleskensgraaf and from 1 October 1950 to 14 January 1951 mayor of Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht. His brother Jan Aantjes was also mayor of several municipalities. Aantjes attended the Marnix Gymnasium in Rotterdam. On 8 February 1940, Aantjes started to work for the postal mail company PTT. On 19 July 1943, he was selected for Arbeitseinsatz and sent to G\u00fcstrow to deliver mail. Aantjes would later say he had not refused selection, because the board of PTT would otherwise have sent a married employee in his place. In September 1944, Aantjes wanted to return to the Netherlands. Other Dutch forced laborers told him that if one joined the Germanic SS, one could ask for an assignment in the Netherlands and be trained as a police officer on the Avegoor estate near Ellecom. Aantjes decided he would follow this route, and enlisted in the Germanic SS. To his dismay, he was assigned to Landstorm Nederland, a division of the Waffen-SS and he received a uniform. After being transferred to Hoogeveen, Aantjes refused to wear the uniform and to enlist in Landstorm Nederland. He was arrested and imprisoned in Port Natal near Assen, an abandoned psychiatric hospital that had been turned into a work camp by the Nazis. After the war ended in May 1945, Aantjes enrolled at the University of Utrecht to study law. He never mentioned his enlisting in the Germaanse-SS to anyone. Aantjes became a member of the House of Representatives for the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) in 1959. He was offered the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment in 1967. He turned it down, because several party members knew enough about his war past to object to his candidacy in public. On 6 July 1971, Aantjes became leader of the ARP group. Aantjes played an important part in the merger of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP), the Christian Historical Union (CHU) and the Catholic People's Party (KVP) into the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). His address to the first joint congress of the three parties, which was held in 1975, has become known as the \"Sermon on the Mount\". After the general election of 1977, Aantjes was offered the Ministry of Justice in the first cabinet of Prime Minister Dries van Agt. Again, Aantjes refused, and used his continuing involvement in the development of the CDA party as reason for his refusal. He then became the first leader of the CDA party in the House of Representatives on 20 December 1977. In 1978, Loe de Jong of the Dutch Institute for War Documentation was confronted with stories about Aantjes's alleged sympathies for Nazism. Although the Institute usually did not respond to such rumors, De Jong - considering the high position of Aantjes - believed that further investigation was necessary. His staff discovered a note, which showed that Aantjes was mobilized in October 1944 as part of the Waffen-SS. On 6 November 1978, Loe de Jong of the Dutch Institute for War Documentation announced in a press conference that Aantjes had signed up for the Waffen-SS in World War II, and that he had been a camp guard in Port Natal. Aantjes, at that time leader of the CDA party in the House of Representatives, resigned his position as parliamentary party leader and member of the House of Representatives the next day. Aantjes argued he had joined the Germanic SS because he believed that this was the only legal way to escape from forced labor in G\u00fcstrow. While De Jong assumed that Aantjes had joined the Germanic SS out of mere opportunism or sympathy for the Nazi ideology or the Dutch collaborating fascist National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands, Aantjes said this was not the case. A later investigation showed that Aantjes was right and had instead been interned at Port Natal, and De Jong admitted to have made mistakes. The affair was publicly seen as a way to get rid of Aantjes by his political rivals. Official(in Dutch) Mr. W.

He was suspected of having organized multiple terror attacks in Belgium and France, and is known to have masterminded the November 2015 Paris attacks. Prior to the Paris attacks, there was an international arrest warrant issued for Abaaoud for his activities in recruiting individuals to Islamic terrorism in Syria. Abaaoud was also known as Abu Omar Soussi (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0633\u064a\u200e, meaning \"Abu Omar of Sous\", his Moroccan family's place of origin) and as Abu Omar al-Balj\u012bk\u012b (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062c\u064a\u0643\u064a\u200e, meaning Abu Omar of Belgium), both of which were noms de guerre. Abdelhamid, one of six children, was born on 8 April 1987 in Anderlecht, a municipality of Brussels, Belgium. He was the son of Omar Abaaoud, who emigrated to Belgium from Morocco in 1975. Omar Abaaoud's first employment after emigration was in mining, before he was employed as a shopkeeper. Abaaoud grew up in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, an area in Brussels where \"the radical Salafist ideology has flourished among some young Muslims. \" He attended the select Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Pierre in Uccle from 1999 to 2000. An article from 2015 said childhood friends claimed Abaaoud had smoked \"a lot of cannabis\" during his teenage years. Both Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam were arrested during December 2010 for attempting to break into a parking garage, according to the lawyer representing Abaaoud. Abaaoud alone had spent time in at least three prisons, and had a number of arrests for assault, and other crimes. The nature of these latter crimes were not disclosed by his lawyer. For a time, sometime prior to 2013, Abdelhamid Abaaoud was involved in trading via employment with his father. In 2013, he recruited his then 13-year-old brother Younes to join him in Syria. They left for Syria on 19 January 2014, for which he was convicted of abduction, having been previously convicted of robbery. Abaaoud is reported to have joined a group within ISIL known as al-Battar Katiba, (the al-Battar Battalion) during the fight against Bashar al-Assad in 2013. He returned to Belgium by the end of the same year. In 2014, independent journalists \u00c9tienne Huver and Guillaume Lhotellier visited the Syria\u2013Turkey border, where they obtained photos and video of Abaaoud's time in Syria. One portion of this material showed Abaaoud and others loading bloody corpses into a truck and trailer before Abaaoud grinned and told the camera: \"Before we towed jet skis, motorcycles, quad bikes, big trailers filled with gifts for vacation in Morocco. Now, thank God, following God's path, we're towing apostates, infidels who are fighting us. \" Within Syria, Abaaoud is known to have been active at Hraytan. A diary entry while there records: \"Admittedly there is no joy in spilling blood, although it's nice to see, from time to time, the blood of the infidels\". Analysis of a telephone call established Abaaoud was in contact with Mehdi Nemmouche during January 2014. Nemmouche, a Franco-Algerian jihadist, shot and killed four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels on 24 May 2014. Belgian authorities suspect him of having helped to organize and finance a terror cell in Verviers. This cell was raided on 15 January 2015 and two members of the cell were killed. In an interview with Dabiq, the magazine of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), Abaaoud bragged on social media about going to Belgium to lead the cell but escaped back to Syria, even being stopped by a police officer who compared him to a photo but did not identify him. In July 2015, following the Verviers raid, he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to twenty years in prison by a Belgian judge for organizing terrorism. In an interview with Dabiq magazine published February 2015, Abaaoud was reported to have made comments of his intention to fight persons of the Western world which he identifies as \"the crusaders\". Abaaoud was put under investigation as a possible link to four out of six attacks foiled in France since spring 2015. This included an attempted attack by Sid Ahmed Ghlam at a church in Villejuif near Paris in April 2015, as well as the thwarted Thalys train attack, which occurred on 21 August 2015. According to a BBC report on 19 November 2015, after Abaaoud's death, France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters that he had received intelligence that Abaaoud passed through Greece on his return from Syria. It is unclear whether the Belgian had concealed himself among the thousands of migrants arriving in Greece before heading for other EU nations. Greek officials subsequently insisted that there was no evidence that Abaaoud had been in that country. Confirming that Abaaoud had left for Syria last year, Cazeneuve said no EU states had signalled his return. By 16 November 2015, French and Belgian security services were focused on Abaaoud, who they believed to have been the leader of the Paris attacks. On 18 November, French authorities conducted a raid that ended in the injury of five police officers, three deaths, and at least five arrests, although some reports later indicated eight. The raid took place in the suburb of Saint-Denis in north Paris, and targeted Abaaoud. He was later confirmed to be one of the three fatalities in the raid. The police were aware that Hasna Ait Boulahcen, a suspect in a drug ring investigation during which her telephone was tapped, also of Moroccan origin, was an associate of Abaaoud. They followed her to a Saint-Denis apartment building at 8 Rue Corbillon on 17 November and saw Abaaoud entering with her. This was the building where the subsequent raid started at 4:20 am on 18 November. The prosecutor's office said that Abaaoud's body was found in the apartment that had been targeted in the raid and that the identification was made using skin samples, according to some published reports. However, other reports referred to identification by fingerprint samples taken from Abaaoud's mutilated body which had been riddled with bullets and bits of shrapnel from a grenade explosion. Abaaoud's fingerprints were found on an AK-47 rifle found in an abandoned car. According to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, Abaaoud had \"played a decisive role\" in the Paris attacks and played a part in four of six terror attacks foiled since spring of 2015, with one alleged jihadist claiming Abaaoud had trained him personally. The French prosecutor also stated on 24 November that Abaaoud was planning another attack in La D\u00e9fense, a major business district in the Paris Metropolitan Area. West Midlands Police also recovered nearly 50 video clips and digital photographs from his phone. Among the photos were those of the Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham and other locations in the city. Abaaoud had visited the United Kingdom in August 2015. He arrived at Dover by ferry despite being hunted by Belgian authorities. Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam were in prison together in Belgium. Abaaoud was apparently connected to Sharia4Belgium. Abaaoud was thought by counter-terrorism officials to have been close to Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi, and the link between ISIL leadership in Syria and terror cells operating in Europe. He was also connected to Charaffe al Mouadan, who was based in Syria and a participating member of ISIS prior to his death on 24 December. On 5 December, officials confirmed Abaaoud had two connections living in the Bordesley Green and Alum Rock areas of Birmingham, England. E.

He was murdered in 2015. George Abanga was born on August 4, 1976. He had a daughter named Emefa and a wife whose name is unidentified. Abanga was murdered at age 39. George Abanga began as a tailor, but later moved to radio to become a serial caller. For ten years, he was a reporter at Success FM in Goaso. He was also a correspondent for Peace FM in Accra. Abanga's reporting could have been a factor in his murder. He had just reported issues concerning some of the cocoa farmers from Sankore. There had been theft of fertilizers in that area. He had also recently reported some regional political tensions. Police have connected some of Abanga's work to his death. On September 10, 2015, George Abanga was murdered on his drive home after reporting a theft of fertilizer in Sankore in the Brong-Ahafo Region. His attackers had the road blocked off. His left arm was shot, close to the shoulder. None of his belongings were taken, which led the investigators to believe that the murder was related to his journalist work and was not a robbery. At the time of his death, he had a wallet, containing GHS 160 in Ghanaian currency, two mobile phones, and a motorcycle. After the shooting, he was taken to the District Hospital in Goaso. He was declared dead upon arrival at the hospital. The police issued the following statement after Abanga was killed: \"We cannot suspect robbery at the moment. Also he is not around to tell us what happened; that is why we are treating this as murder. \"The suspect who confessed to the crime was a man in his mid-40s. Although the motive was not determined, the man confessed because he said he believed Abanga's ghost was chasing him. The motive of Abanga's murderers was hard for investigators to determine. The police believed that the murder was connected to Abanga's stories about stolen fertilizers from cocoa farmers in the area. It could also have been connected to his reporting on the political problems with the President John Dramani Mahama's National Democratic Congress. Editor at Success FM Atiewin Mohammed suspected a different story to be the reasoning behind Abanga's murder. Abanga had reported on the National Democratic Congress political party. Some of the members from Asibrem demanded the sack of some of the members of the party. This political story could have been another motive for the murder. Abanga had also led a protest of nine followers of the National Democratic Congress. He had stated that the LESDEP planners took their money to provide them with tricycles but nothing was delivered. Another possible explanation for his death was that the armed attackers had mistaken him for a cocoa purchaser whom they had been chasing to rob. Violence against reporters is uncommon in Ghana, which made this case unusual. Of the journalists worldwide killed in 2015, two-thirds of them were murdered as a direct result of their work. In 2015, South Sudan, Poland, and Ghana made it onto the Committee to Protect Journalists' (CPJ) killed database for the first time. George Abanga was just one of the many journalists who were killed due to their profession. The most common reporting topics that led to journalists being attacked or killed dealt with politics, then war and human rights. The Concerned Youth of Asunafo South has stated that people have been targeted and killed while law enforcers haven't done much to investigate and catch the criminals. They have tried to spread awareness about this issue. Reminding law enforcers of this issue may help save other journalists' lives.

Abbas rose to prominence as a result of his involvement in the 1969 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat, following which he became the Deputy Chairman of the ruling National Revolutionary Command Council. Abbas was appointed as Minister of Defense on 29 October 1969 following a cabinet reshuffle implemented to strengthen the army's control over the Sudanese government. Abbas, an anti-Mahdist and non-communist, was given the role. As Defense Minister he, alongside Babiker, would push Nimeiry to adopt a more aggressive response to the rising threat to the government posed by the Ansar movement, resulting in the brutal crackdown seen on Aba Island in 1970. Abbas's tenure also saw the attempted 1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat, during which his younger brother was killed.

After the Constitutional Court banned HADEP, DEHAP was the continuation party. At legislative election in November 2002 his party won 6. 2 of the popular vote. But because of the 10 percent election threshold the party could not send representatives to Turkish parliament. Abbasoglu was sentenced to one year in prison in 2004 by Turkish courts for an alleged false documentation of DEHAP to the High Electoral Committee. The decision by the court was thought to be a political one.

A former member of the Lavender Menace, she co-authored Sappho Was a Right-on Woman: A Liberated View of Lesbianism and was one of the most vocal and active members in the National Organization for Women, helping the organization to focus on not just women's rights in general, but lesbian rights, as well. Sidney Afton Abbott was born in 1937 into a military family, describing herself as a military brat. She attended Smith College for three years, and graduated from the University of New Mexico in 1961. She then attended Columbia University for graduate school, studying urban planning. In 1969 she joined the National Organization for Women (NOW) and became one of the first people to speak out for lesbian rights on panels at the New York chapter of NOW and at Columbia University. Abbott was a member of the Lavender Menace and co-authored Sappho Was a Right-on Woman: A Liberated View of Lesbianism in 1971, with Barbara Love. In the mid-1970s, with Barbara Love, she lobbied for a NOW task force to be established to focus on lesbian issues, eventually it was established. NOW first named the task force the \"sexuality and lesbian task force,\" and Abbott had to co-chair with a heterosexual woman. At the NOW national conference in Philadelphia in 1976, Abbott demanded that 1% of the organizations budget should go to the task force, and succeeded. During the conference, it was only one of two resolutions to pass. Abbott served on the founding board of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and worked to ensure the organization's board was equal numbers gay men and lesbian women.

"}, {"text": "Zulkifli Abdhir (5 January 1966 or 5 October 1966 \u2013 25 January 2015) was a Malaysian who was one of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agency offered a US$5 million reward for information leading to his capture. He was the maker of bombs delivered for usage to several terrorist groups. He was often referred to by the nom de guerre Marwan. He was suspected of leading the Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia, being part of the central command of the Jemaah Islamiyah, and of involvement in the 2002 Bali bombings. He was suspected of hiding in Mindanao under the protection of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. Zulkifli was killed on 25 January 2015 by Special Action Force (SAF) officers during the raid that culminated in the Mamasapano clash. Zulkifli was born on 5 January 1966 or 5 October 1966 in Muar, Johor, Malaysia. Zulkifli was known to reference both dates in different circumstances as his date of birth. According to the FBI, he was 5 feet 6 inches tall, approximately 120 pounds, and could speak Malay, Tagalog, English, and Arabic. Zulkifli attended a boarding school in Malaysia until he trained overseas as an engineer in the USA. After his training, he abruptly left his 10 siblings and 3 children to join up with terrorist activities. I remember him saying that he wanted to secure a good job and provide for the family. He used to take me sightseeing regularly and helped me with the household expenses. Then he was gone. Zulkifli, often going under the nom de guerre \"Marwan\", was suspected to be in charge of the South Eastern Asian and Indonesian terrorist group called the Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM). The KMM is/was a part of the international terrorist organisation, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), of which Zulkifli was believed to be part of its central command. The JI is the main cause of the devastating 2002 Bali bombings and many other attacks in South Eastern Asia of which Zulkifli's involvement in is also suspected. Abdhir also co-founded the terrorist group Khalifa Islamiyah Mindanao. He was initially wanted by the Malaysian government for the killing of a Christian member of their Parliament in 2000, which was an attack that was backed by Al-Qaeda. Zulkifli was wanted for the allegation of being a supplier of bombs to various terrorist groups around the world. He was also under suspicion of teaching terrorists how to create bombs. Zulkifli, himself, was taught to make IEDs by the terrorist Azahari Husin. He was involved in the building of bombs for the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group, which brought him into brief collaborations with Umar Patek, before Patek's leaving to Pakistan, and with Khadaffy Janjalani (deceased). Zulkifli was indicted for arrest on 1 August 2007 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. While hiding in Mindanao under the protection of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), he continued to stay involved in militant Islamic activity and terrorist bombings. An anonymous military source told Gulf News that, along with other South Eastern Asian militants, Zulkifli was engaged in the training of local jihadist volunteers to join The Islamic State. This was reported after the BIFF declared its allegiance to helping ISIL's cause. Sources have estimated that during his militant activity in Mindanao he may have trained up to 300 terrorists in explosives use, detonation, and building. It was reported from news organisations on 26 January 2015, that the Jemaah Islamiyah in co-ordination with Zulkifli had planned to construct a bomb to be detonated as the papal convoy drove down T. M. Kalaw Street in Manila on 18 January. The source also claimed that another attempt on the Pope's life was planned the day before, but was thwarted by changes in the Pope's plans. Filipino police have denied the legitimacy of these reports. His brother, Rahmat Abdhir, was arrested in California for conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, providing material to terrorists, false statements, and providing material to a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (Zulkifli). In an email between the two they discussed the exchange rates and prices of weapons, specifically an M60 machine gun. Further investigation showed that Rahmat had wired over 10,000 dollars to his brother. Federal agents discovered 1,000 rounds of ammunition, scopes to sniper rifles, two-way radios, military training manuals, and materials used to make bombs. Rahmat was refused bail twice, once upon his initial arrest and a second time in 2008. He is currently in custody in a California prison, contrary to unverified reports of his residence being in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, where he submitted his DNA to confirm his brother's demise. The FBI told Reuters that he was \"a person familiar with the testing procedures\", indicating they extracted his DNA previously. His brother-in-law, Taufik bin Abdul Halim was also arrested for terrorist charges in 2001 for involvement in an attempted mall bombing located in Jakarta, Indonesia. The explosive device reportedly triggered early leading to little or no injuries besides Taufik himself, who lost his leg in the explosion. After 12 years in jail for his attempted bombing, Taufik was released and flown back to Johor to be with his family after being pardoned by President of Indonesia Joko Widodo. Malaysian police have promised to monitor his actions due to his high-profile relation to Zulkifli. Zulkifli Abdhir is the cousin of Malaysian terrorist Mohamad Farik Amin (alias Zubair Zaid), who is also suspected as a main culprit in the 2002 Bali bombings. Amin is one of two Malaysians to be currently detained at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. Early reports claimed that in the Philippines, Zulkifli died during an airstrike on 2 February 2012. The Malaysian government asked for an official DNA comparison to the DNA of one of Zulkifli's siblings. DNA results were obtained from family members of Zulkifli. His body was never found despite reports of his death. The statements of his supposed death were later retracted as the manhunt continued. Von Al Haq, a spokesperson for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), claimed in 2013 that Zulkifli was being protected by Ameril Umbra Kato's Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF). This claim was later corroborated by an interrogation with a detained Abu Sayyaf commander, Khair Mundos, who claimed that he travelled to the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters with Zulkifli. Local informants have also claimed Zulkifli to have visited the province of Maguindanao. The detained Abu Sayyaf leader claimed that Zulkifli, and other high ranking Jemaah Islamiyah leader, Muhamda \"Muawiyah\" Ali, escaped the February airstrike that was reported to have killed them in Sulu and have taken refuge with the Bangsamoro separatists. The Philippine National Police Special Action Force attempted an operation on 25 January 2015 to arrest Zulkifli. The operation culminated in a battle in Mamasapano between the PNP and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), breaking the ceasefire. The MILF was later joined by their breakaway group, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, in a battle that led to the death of 44 police officers, several civilians, and at least 18 militants. The Philippines mobilised more reinforcements though they were cautious in attempting to not create more civilian casualties. Reasons for the clashes and renewed hostilities are being attributed to a lack of communication between the PNP, the military, and MILF before undertaking the operation. It was thought of as \"highly likely\" that Zulkifli had been killed in the raid until the FBI provided DNA confirmation of his demise in the clash. Reports say that he was killed by SAF officer(s) on 25 January 2015. Early in the morning of 25 January 2015, Zulkifli was reportedly taken by surprise as his nipa hut was raided by SAF member(s) who proceeded to shoot and kill Zulkifli after a brief exchange of fire. The commandos sent a cellphone message back to their base saying: \"Mike 1 bingo\", a code to be used in case Zulkifli was neutralised. An SAF officer severed one of Zulkifli's fingers and retrieved a hair sample to bring back for official DNA testing, as Zulkifli's body could not be recovered in time due to heavy fire. His corpse was quickly buried by civilians in accordance with Islamic tradition. Regional governor Mujiv Sabbihi Hataman has stated that the body could not be exhumed as that would go against Islamic burial practices. The FBI were requested to help confirm Marwan's DNA samples. The status of his death remained controversial for a while after it was reported, due to the Sulu airstrike incident in 2012, where the military incorrectly reported Zulkifli's death until August 2014. Despite claims of his demise, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) claimed that Marwan was still alive. The MNLF confirmed Zulkifli's demise in the clash and continues to state that they have not been sheltering Zulkifli. The MNLF said that based on an intelligence report they received that said Marwan is dead as a result of the encounter. MILF chairman Al-Hajj Murad Ebrahim also told that Abdul Basit Usman, who was also pursued by SAF troops was able to escape. It was reported that his last words as he attempted to fire against the SAF officers raiding his nipa hut were \"Allahu Akbar!\" On 4 February 2015, the FBI sent a message to Philippine authorities confirming that the DNA obtained from the killed man during the PNP Special Action Force Operation Exodus was from Zulkifli. Though absolute identification was not possible in the preliminary stages of testing, the FBI has reported that the DNA samples were very likely to be Zulkifli's due to striking similarities. The FBI officially confirmed Zulkifli's death on April 1, 2015. His family in Malaysia have said that they have no intention to claim his body, his daughter said \"To us, our father died a long time ago, there is no need to claim the body. \"A male relative said; \"Our family had been informed six times, over the years, that he had been killed. I am tired of saying Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un (surely we belong to Allah and to Him shall we return). All he told us were lies after lies. We are the ones who were forced to face the predicament of his doings. More so after he was labelled as the mastermind behind the 2002 Bali Bombings. \" adding that the only person who still saw the good in Marwan was his mother. The same male relative spoke angrily of Zulkifli's brother Rahmat and claimed that he was highly impressionable and was manipulated by Zulkifli into providing the support that he did. The relative blamed Zulkifli for ruining Rahmat's life, including for his children and wife.

He was widely recognized as an outstanding actor and the many productions that he directed provided him with a reputation as one of the leading theater directors in Iran. In 1979, he was admitted to the dramatic arts faculty of Tehran to start his education in the directing and acting program. Abdollahi established the Koocheh (meaning alley in English) theater group in his birthplace in 1970. During 46 years of activity, he staged numerous plays both as an actor and as a director. He also acted in many movies, TV theaters, Radio dramas, and TV series. His artistic activities include acting and directing in 62 theater productions, directing several TV theaters and short films, directing and voice acting in more than 500 radio plays, and playing in famous TV series like Heroes Never Die, Lighter Than Darkness, and Zero Degree Turn. Abdollahi is also the recipient of many awards for various artistic activities. Born in 1955 in the city of Borujerd, Abdollahi passed his childhood and teenage years in his birthplace. As he said: \"I was registered in Bahman school of Borujerd\". He established Koocheh theater group in 1970. Koocheh theater, which was the first scientific and organized theater in Borujerd, announced its existence by performing the Farmer of Chicago by Mark Twain. Activity of Koocheh theater group in borujerd lasted until 1979. During 9 years, the members of Koocheh theater group performed 17 plays from famous Iranian and western playwrights such as Bahram Beyzai, Athol Fugard, William Shakespeare, Gholam-Hossein Sa'edi, and Augusta, Lady Gregory. After starting his studies at the Dramatic Arts Faculty of Tehran, Abdollahi was selected to play a small role in a play titled Enemies written by Maxim Gorky and directed by maestro Rokneddin Khosravi. Within the rehearsal sessions, his virtuosity and endeavor caused Khosravi to choose him for Zakarov role, which is one of the leading roles in Enemies. This play, however, was not performed because of the so-called cultural revolution and its sequences in Iran. Iranian cultural revolution caused universities to be closed, therefore Abdollahi voluntarily went to Kerman province to help earthquake-stricken people and collaborated in rebuilding damaged towns. Because of universities reopening in Iran by the end of the cultural revolution, he came back to Tehran and prepared Sizwe Banzi is dead as the graduation thesis of his classmate Majid Beheshti. His brilliant performance attracted Hamid Samandarian's and Ghotbeddin Sadeghi's attentions who were two outstanding directors in Iran. Abdollahi was one the first artists invited to join Honar theater group which was established by Ghotbeddin Sadeghi. He collaborated with Honar theater group as the director and actor in more than 25 plays. During 90's, the acting duo Mostafa Abdollahi and Michael Shahrestani was very famous and admirable in the Iran theater. Many people know Abdollahi for his playing the role of an Iranian hero named Arsalan in the Heroes Never Die TV series. Abdollahi started his acting in Iran television since 1986. He also participated in several movies such as Living with the presence of a wall, Eye witness, and Mah-banoo. Moreover, Abdollahi had many successful experiences in acting and directing dramas for Iran national radio and television. By and large, he was recognized as a prominent artist in Iran and as Ghotbeddin Sadeghi said: \u201cHe never staged dull and useless plays, which are far from the culture of his homeland and he had faith in what he did on stage\u201dHaving a critical approach towards the domestic affairs in Iran, Mostafa Abdollahi profoundly tried to introduce salient western playwrights to the Iranian society. For Instance, he was the first Iranian producer who directed a play by Pavel Kohout titled War on the third floor. Abdollahi also introduced famous Russian writer Nikolai Erdman to Iranian audience by staging The mandate. After performing Accidental death of an anarchist, a play written by Dari Fo, Koocheh theater group founded by Abdollahi was recognized the best theater group in Iran in 2013. While having his last play, The lower depths written by Maxim Gorky, on the stage of the main hall of the Tehran City Theater Complex, he passed away in Tehran on 21 May 2015 after 14 years of suffering from blood cancer. During 46 years of artistic activity, Abdollahi received numerous awards from various festivals and was paid tributes by his colleague and also Iranian universities.

He served as the Emir of the northern border region and its capital and administrative Arar from 1957 until his death in 2017, and before that he served as the Governor of Qassim region for ten years. He was one of the longest serving governors in the Kingdom. Abdullah was born in Hail in 1931, 1348 AH, and his father, Prince Abdul Aziz bin Musa'ed, is the cousin of King Abdul Aziz and one of his commanders. His brother, Prince Jiluwi bin Abdul Aziz bin Musa'ed, is the governor of Najran Region. Prince Abdullah was appointed by King Saud as a northern border region governor in 1956. Prince Abdullah bin Abdullaziz bin Musa'ed died on 4 July 2015. He was buried after Isha prayer on 6 July 2015 at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.

He ascended to the throne on 1 August 2005 upon the death of his half-brother, King Fahd. Abdullah, like Fahd, was one of the many sons of Ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Abdullah held important political posts throughout most of his adult life. In 1961 he became mayor of Mecca, his first public office. The following year, he was appointed commander of the Saudi Arabian National Guard, a post he was still holding when he became king. He also served as deputy defense minister and was named crown prince when Fahd took the throne in 1982. After King Fahd suffered a serious stroke in 1995, Abdullah became the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia until ascending the throne a decade later. During his reign he maintained close relations with United States and United Kingdom and bought billions of dollars worth of defense equipment from both states. He also gave women the right to vote for municipal councils and to compete in the Olympics. Furthermore, Abdullah maintained the status quo when there were waves of protest in the kingdom during the Arab Spring. In November 2013, a BBC report claimed that, due to the close relations it had with Pakistan, Saudi Arabia could obtain nuclear weapons at will from that country. The King also had a longstanding relationship with Pakistan, and brokered a compromise between ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and General Pervez Musharraf, whom he had requested to be exiled to Saudi Arabia for a 10-year exile, following his ouster in the 1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat. The King outlived two of his crown princes. Conservative Interior Minister Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud was named heir to the throne on the death of Sultan bin Abdulaziz in October 2011, but Nayef himself died in June 2012. Abdullah then named 76-year-old defense minister, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, as crown prince. According to various reports, Abdullah married up to 30 times and had more than 35 children. The king had a personal fortune estimated at US$18 billion, making him the third wealthiest head of state in the world. He died on 23 January 2015, at the age of 90, three weeks after being hospitalized for pneumonia, and was succeeded as king by his half-brother Salman of Saudi Arabia. Abdullah is said to have been born on 1 August 1924 in Riyadh. However, some sources state that this date is incorrect, and that he was approximately eight years older. He was the tenth son of King Abdulaziz. His mother, Fahda bint Asi Al Shuraim, was a member of the Al Rashid dynasty, longtime rivals of the Al Saud dynasty. She was descended from the powerful Shammar tribe \u2013 and was the daughter of former tribe chief, Asi Shuraim. She died when Abdullah was six years old. He had younger full-sisters. Madawi Al-Rasheed argues that his maternal roots and his earlier experience of a speech impediment led to delay in his rise to higher status among the other sons of King Abdulaziz. In 1963, Abdullah was made commander of Saudi National Guard (SANG). This post allowed him to secure his position in the House of Saud. SANG, which had been based on the Ikhwan, became a modern armed force under his command. Beginning 1985, SANG also sponsored the Janadiriyah festival that institutionalized traditional folk dances, camel races and tribal heritage. King Khalid appointed Prince Abdullah as second deputy prime minister in March 1975, a reflection of his status as second in the line of succession to the Saudi throne. In other words, upon this appointment, Prince Abdullah became the number three man in the Saudi administration. However, his appointment caused friction in the House of Saud. Then-crown prince Prince Fahd, together with his full-brothers known as the Sudairi Seven, supported the appointment of their own full brother, Prince Sultan. Prince Abdullah was pressured to cede control of SANG in return for his appointment as Second Deputy Prime Minister. In August 1977, this generated a debate among hundreds of princes in Riyadh. Abdullah did not relinquish authority of SANG because he feared that this would weaken his authority. On 13 June 1982 \u2013 the day King Khalid died \u2013 Fahd bin Abdulaziz became King, Prince Abdullah became Crown Prince the same day and also maintained his position as head of the National Guard. During his years as crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz was described as a supporter of accommodation. He managed to group a large number of fringe and marginalized princes discontented with the prospect of the succession being passed among the Sudairi brothers one after the other. His control of the National Guard was also a key factor to his success in becoming crown prince. When King Fahd was incapacitated by a major stroke in 1995, Crown Prince Abdullah acted as de facto regent of Saudi Arabia. In May 2001, Crown Prince Abdullah did not accept an invitation to visit Washington due to US support for Israel in the Second Intifada. He also appeared more eager than King Fahd to cut government spending and open Saudi Arabia up economically. He pushed for Saudi membership of the World Trade Organization, surprising some. In August 2001, he ordered then Saudi Ambassador to the US, Bandar bin Sultan, to return to Washington. This reportedly occurred after Crown Prince Abdullah witnessed brutality inflicted by an Israeli soldier upon a Palestinian woman. Later, he also condemned Israel for attacking families of suspects. In 2002, he developed the Arab Peace Initiative, commonly referred to as the \"Abdullah plan\", to achieve a mutually agreed-on resolution of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. The initiative was adopted at the Arab League's Beirut summit in March 2002. On the second anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Crown Prince Abdullah wrote a letter to US President George W. Bush, which ended with the following words: \"God Almighty, in His wisdom, tests the faithful by allowing such calamities to happen. But He, in His mercy, also provides us with the will and determination, generated by faith, to enable us to transform such tragedies into great achievements, and crises that seem debilitating are transformed into opportunities for the advancement of humanity. I only hope that, with your cooperation and leadership, a new world will emerge out of the rubble of the World Trade Center: a world that is blessed by the virtues of freedom, peace, prosperity and harmony. \" By late 2003, after the Saudi Arabian branch of al-Qaeda carried out a series of bombings that threatened to destabilize the country, Crown Prince Abdullah, together with other decision-making elites began to deal with political concerns. As Toby Jones wrote in Middle East Report: One of such moves was his project to promote more tolerance for religious diversity and rein in the forces of politico-religious extremism in the kingdom, leading to the establishment of National Dialogue. In the summer of 2003, Abdullah threw his considerable weight behind the creation of a national dialogue that brought leading religious figures together, including a highly publicized meeting attended by the kingdom's preeminent Shi'i scholar Hasan al-Saffar, as well as a group of Sunni clerics that had previously expressed their loathing for the Shi'i minority. Abdullah succeeded to the throne upon the death of his half-brother King Fahd. He was formally enthroned on 2 August 2005. King Abdullah's administration attempted reforms in different fields. In 2005, King Abdullah implemented a government scholarship program to send young Saudi men and women abroad for undergraduate and postgraduate studies in different universities around the world. The program offered funds for tuition and living expenses up to four years. It is estimated that more than 70,000 young Saudis studied abroad in more than 25 countries, with the United States, England, and Australia as top three destinations aimed for by the students. There are more than 22,000 Saudi students studying in the United States, exceeding pre-9/11 levels. Public health engagement included breast cancer awareness and CDC cooperation to set up an advanced epidemic screening network to protect 2010's three million Hajj pilgrims. King Abdullah implemented many reform measures. He re-shuffled the Ministry of Education's leadership in February 2009 by bringing in his pro-reform son-in-law, Faisal bin Abdullah, as the new minister. He also appointed Nora Al Fayez, a U. S. -educated former teacher, as deputy education minister in charge of a new department for female students. He brought about a top-to-bottom restructuring of the country's courts to introduce, among other things, review of judicial decisions and more professional training for Shari'a judges. He developed a new investment promotion agency to overhaul the once-convoluted process of starting a business in Saudi Arabia and created a regulatory body for capital markets. He also promoted the construction of the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (the country's new flagship and controversially co-ed institution for advanced scientific research). King Abdullah invested in educating the workforce for future jobs. The Saudi government also encouraged the development of non-hydrocarbon sectors in which the Kingdom had a comparative advantage, including mining, solar energy, and religious tourism. The Kingdom's 2010 budget reflected these priorities\u2014about 25 percent was devoted to education alone\u2014and amounts to a significant economic stimulus package. The response of his administration to homegrown terrorism was a series of crackdowns including raids by security forces, arrests, torture and public beheadings. He vowed to fight terrorist ideologies within the country. He also made the protection of Saudi Arabia's critical infrastructure a top security priority. His strategy against terrorism was two-pronged: he attacked the roots of the extremism that fed Al-Qaida through education and judicial reforms to weaken the influence of the most reactionary elements of Saudi Arabia's religious establishment. In August 2010, King Abdullah decreed that only officially approved religious scholars associated with the Senior Council of Ulema would be allowed to issue fatwas. Similar decrees since 2005 were previously seldom enforced. Individual fatwas relating to personal matters were exempt from the royal decree. The decree also instructed the Grand Mufti to identify eligible scholars. In light of the Arab Spring, Abdullah laid down a $37-billion (\u20ac32,8 billion) programme of new spending including new jobless benefits, education and housing subsidies, debt write-offs, and a new sports channel. There was also a pledge to spend a total of $400 billion by the end of 2014 to improve education, health care and the kingdom's infrastructure. However, Saudi police arrested 100 Shiite protesters who complained of government discrimination. Later during the 2011\u20132012 Saudi Arabian protests, in September 2011, the King announced women's right to vote in the 2015 municipal council elections, a first significant reform step in the country since the protests. He also stated that women would become eligible to take part in the unelected shura. In January 2012, King Abdullah dismissed the head of Saudi Arabia's powerful religious police, replacing him with a more moderate cleric, state news agency SPA reported, without giving reasons. Abdullatif Abdel Aziz al-Sheikh was named, in place of Sheikh Abdulaziz al-Humain, to head the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. King Abdullah had appointed Humain in 2009 to head the \"mutaween,\" which ensures the strict application of the country's ultra-conservative version of Islam, as a step towards reforming it. Humain hired consultants to restructure the organisation, met local human rights groups and consulted professional image-builders in a broad public relations campaign. Under his leadership the commission also investigated and punished some \"out-of-control\" officers for misbehaviour. In July 2012, Saudi Arabia announced that it would allow its women athletes to compete in the Olympics for the first time and that the country's Olympic Committee would \"oversee participation of women athletes who can qualify\". The decision ended speculation that the entire Saudi team might have been disqualified on grounds of gender discrimination. The public participation of women in sport was still fiercely opposed by many Saudi religious conservatives. There had been almost no public tradition of women participating in sport in the country. Saudi officials said that, if successful in qualifying, female competitors would be dressed \"to preserve their dignity\". On 11 January 2013, King Abdullah appointed thirty women to the Consultative Assembly or Shura Council and modified the related law to mandate that no less than 20 percent of 150 members would be women. In August 2013, the Saudi cabinet, for the first time, approved a law making domestic violence a criminal offence. The law calls for a punishment of up to a year in prison and a fine of up to 50,000 riyals (\u20ac11. 500/US$13,000). The maximum punishments could be doubled for repeat offenders. The law criminalizes psychological, sexual as well as physical abuse. It also includes a provision obliging employees to report instances of abuse in the workplace to their employer. The move followed a Twitter campaign. The new laws were welcomed by Saudi women's rights activists, although some expressed concerns that the law could not be implemented successfully without new training for the judiciary, and that the tradition of male guardianship would remain an obstacle to prosecutions. In November 2007, King Abdullah visited Pope Benedict XVI in the Apostolic Palace, being first Saudi monarch to do so. In March 2008, he called for a \"brotherly and sincere dialogue between believers from all religions\". In June 2008, he held a conference in Mecca to urge Muslim leaders to speak with one voice with Jewish and Christian leaders. He discussed with, and obtained approval from, Saudi and non-Saudi Islamic scholars to hold the interfaith dialogue. In the same month, Saudi Arabia and Spain agreed to hold the interfaith dialogue in Spain. The historic conference finally took place in Madrid in July 2008, wherein religious leaders of different faiths participated, and which later led to the 2010 proclamation of World Interfaith Harmony Week. He had never previously made overtures for dialogue with eastern religious leaders, such as Hindus and Buddhists. The Mecca conference discussed a paper on dialogue with monotheists \u2014 highlighting the monotheistic religions of southeast Asia, including Sikhism \u2014 in the third axis of the fourth meeting, titled \"With Whom We Talk,\" presented by Sheikh Badrul Hasan Al Qasimi. The session was chaired by Ezz Eddin Ibrahim, cultural adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates. The session also discussed a paper presented on coordination among Islamic institutions on Dialogue by Abdullah bin Omar Nassif, Secretary General of the World Islamic Council for Preaching and Relief and a paper on dialogue with divine messages, presented by Professor Mohammad Sammak \u2013 Secretary General of the Islamic Spiritual Summit in Lebanon. In November 2008, he and his government arranged discussion at the United Nations General Assembly to \"promote dialogue among civilizations, cultures and peoples, as well as activities related to a culture of peace\" and calling for \"concrete action at the global, regional and subregional levels. \" It brought together Muslim and non-Muslim nations to eradicate preconceptions as to Islam and terrorism, with world leaders \u2013 including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, Israeli President Shimon Peres, US President George W. Bush and King Abdullah II of Jordan \u2013 attending. In 2011, an agreement for the establishment of the King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue in Vienna was signed between the governments of Austria, Spain, and Saudi Arabia. The official opening of the centre was in November 2012, with foreign Minister Saud Al Faisal as its first general secretary and Austria's former federal justice minister Claudia Bandion-Ortner as the first deputy general secretary. King Abdullah called for the establishment of an Arab common market in January 2011. Saudi foreign minister, Saud bin Faisal, stated that the Arab Customs Union would be ready by 2015, and that by 2017 the common market would also be in place. There have been intensive efforts to link Arab countries with a railway system and an electricity power grid. Work on the power grid project has started in some Arab countries. King Abdullah had long been pro-American and a longtime close ally of the United States. In October 1976, as Prince Abdullah was being trained for greater responsibility in Riyadh, he was sent to the United States to meet with President Gerald Ford. He again traveled to the United States as Crown Prince in October 1987, meeting Vice President George H. W. Bush. In September 1998, Crown Prince Abdullah made a state visit to the United States to meet in Washington with President Bill Clinton. In September 2000, he attended millennium celebrations at the United Nations in New York City. In April 2002, Crown Prince Abdullah made a state visit to the United States with President George W. Bush and he returned again in April 2005 with Bush. In April 2009, at a summit for world leaders President Barack Obama met with King Abdullah, while in June 2009 he hosted President Obama in Saudi Arabia. In turn, Obama hosted the King at the White House in the same month. King Abdullah showed great support for Obama's presidency. \"Thank God for bringing Obama to the presidency\", he said, adding that Obama's election created \"great hope\" in the Muslim world. He stated, \"We (the US and Saudi Arabia) spilled blood together\" in Kuwait and Iraq, that Saudi Arabia valued this tremendously and that friendship could be a difficult issue that requires work, but that the United States and Saudi Arabia had done it for 70 years over three generations. \"Our disagreements don't cut to the bone\", he stated. He was the leading gift-giver to the US president and his office in his first two years in office, his gifts totaling more than $300,000. A ruby and diamond jewelry set, given by the king and accepted by Michelle Obama on behalf of the United States, was worth $132,000. However, according to US federal law, gifts of such nature and value are accepted \"on behalf of the United States\" and are considered property of the US government. The Bush administration ignored advice from him and Saudi foreign minister Saud Al Faisal against invading Iraq. However, other sources said that many Arab governments were only nominally opposed to the Iraq invasion because of popular hostility. Before becoming king, Prince Abdullah was thought to be completely against the US invasion of Iraq; this, however, was not the case. Riyadh provided essential support to the United States during the war and proved that \"necessity does lead to some accommodations from time to time\". The King expressed a complete lack of trust in Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki and held out little hope for improved Saudi-Iraqi relations as long as al-Maliki remained in office. King Abdullah told an Iraqi official about Al Maliki, \"You and Iraq are in my heart, but that man is not. \"In September 2014, following the spread of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), he issued a statement, \"From the cradle of revelation and the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, I call on leaders and scholars of the Islamic nation to carry out their duty towards God Almighty, and to stand in the face of those trying to hijack Islam and present it to the world as a religion of extremism, hatred, and terrorism, and to speak the word of truth, and not fear anybody. Our nation today is passing through a critical, historic stage, and history will be witness against those who have been the tool exploited by the enemies to disperse and tear the nation and tarnish the pure image of Islam\". In 2006, Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei had sent his adviser Ali Akbar Velayati with a letter asking for King Abdullah's agreement to establish a formal back channel of communication between the two leaders. Abdullah said he had agreed, and the channel was established, with Velayati and Saud Al Faisal as the points of contact. In the ensuing years, the King noted, the channel had never been used. In April 2008, according to a US cable released by WikiLeaks, King Abdullah had told the US Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, and General David Petraeus to \"cut off the head of the snake\". Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to Washington, Adel al-Jubeir, \"recalled the King's frequent exhortations to the US to attack Iran\" and to put an end to that country's nuclear program. King Abdullah asserted that Iran was trying to set up Hezbollah-like organizations in African countries, observing that the Iranians didn't think they were doing anything wrong and didn't recognize their mistakes. He said that the Iranians \"launch missiles with the hope of putting fear in people and the world\". The King described his conversation with Iranian foreign minister Mottaki as \"a heated exchange, frankly discussing Iran's interference in Arab affairs\". When challenged by the King on Iranian meddling in Hamas affairs, Mottaki apparently protested that \"these are Muslims\". \"No, Arabs\", countered the King. \"You as Persians have no business meddling in Arab matters\". King Abdullah said he would favor Rafsanjani in an Iranian election. He told General Jones that Iranian internal turmoil presented an opportunity to weaken the regime\u2014which he encouraged\u2014but he also urged that this be done covertly, stressing that public statements in support of the reformers were counterproductive. The King assessed that sanctions could help weaken the government, but only if they are strong and sustained. Saudi Arabia, by the endorsement of the Gulf Cooperation Council, sent 1,200 troops to Bahrain to protect industrial facilities, resulting in strained relations with the United States. The military personnel were part of the Peninsula Shield Force, which is stationed in Saudi Arabia, but not affiliated to one country alone. In December 2010, leaked diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks revealed that King Abdullah wanted all released detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to be tracked using an implanted microchip, in a way similar to race horses. The King made the private suggestion during a meeting in Riyadh in March 2009 with White House counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan. Brennan replied that \"horses don't have good lawyers\" and that such a proposal would \"face legal hurdles\" in the United States. Since King Abdullah's visit to Beijing in January 2006, Saudi-Chinese relations have focused predominantly on energy and trade. The king's visit was the first by a Saudi head of state to China since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1990. Bilateral trade with China has more than tripled, and China would soon be Saudi Arabia's largest importer. Saudi Arabia also committed significant investments in China, including the $8 billion Fujian refinery. Based on a WikiLeaks cable, the King told the Chinese that it was willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not to develop nuclear weapons. In late March 2011, King Abdullah sent Bandar, Secretary General of the National Security Council, to China to gain its support regarding Saudi Arabia's attitude towards the Arab Spring. In turn, lucrative arms contracts were secretly offered to China by the Kingdom. Furthermore, King Abdullah believed that China as well as India were the future markets for Saudi energy. In November 2009, King Abdullah was received by Nicolas Sarkozy, who committed various diplomatic faux pas. The diplomatic relationship Jacques Chirac had with Saudi Arabia was not evident with Sarkozy. In January 2011, the Kingdom granted asylum to the ousted Tunisian leader, Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, under conditions of no further political involvement. According to leaked cables, King Abdullah was more receptive than Crown Prince Sultan to former Yemeni President Saleh. King Abdullah supported renewed diplomatic relations with the Syrian government and Bashar al-Assad. They met in Damascus on 7 October 2009. In addition, Assad attended the opening of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in October 2009. Relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia deteriorated as a result of the Syrian Civil War. In August 2011, King Abdullah recalled the Saudi Ambassador from Damascus due to the political unrest in Syria and closed its embassy. In December 2011, King Abdullah called on leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council to strengthen their alliance into a united \"single entity\" as they confront threats to national security. \"I ask you today to move from a stage of cooperation to a stage of union in a single entity\", King Abdullah said at the opening session of a GCC meeting in Riyadh in comments aired on Saudi state television. \u201cNo doubt, you all know we are targeted in our security and stability. \u201d On 16 February 2003, Parade magazine's David Wallechinsky rated King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah as the second worst dictators in the world. Most of this criticism stems from the fact that most of Saudi citizens live under a strict Wahhabist interpretation of Sharia law, which mandates the amputation of hands as a punishment for theft and floggings for crimes like drunkenness. Execution by public beheading is common for murder, rape, drug trafficking and witchcraft, and Abdullah's policies towards the rights of women have also been criticized. In a slight rebuff to accusations of human rights violations, Saudi inmates of Najran Province sent the King well-wishes from jail and wished him a speedy recovery. King Abdullah has also been criticized for his policies on religious freedom and the Saudi government allegedly has arrested Shiite pilgrims on the Hajj. On 24 January 2007, Human Rights Watch sent an open letter to King Abdullah asking him to cease religious persecution of the Ahmadi faith in Saudi Arabia. Two letters were sent in November 2006 and February 2007 asking him to remove the travel ban on critics of the Saudi government. Human Rights Watch has not yet indicated whether they have received any response to these letters. On 30 October 2007, during a state visit to the UK, King Abdullah was accused by protestors of being a \"murderer\" and a \"torturer\". Concerns were raised about the treatment of women and homosexuals by the Saudi kingdom and over alleged bribes involving arms deals between Saudi Arabia and the UK. King Abdullah's heir apparent was his half-brother Crown Prince Sultan until the latter's death on 22 October 2011. The title of Crown Prince then passed to Prince Sultan's full-brother, Nayef, until his death in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June 2012, while undergoing medical tests for an undisclosed ailment. His third heir apparent was his half-brother Salman, who was named as Crown Prince on 18 June 2012, and would succeed him in 2015. In 2006, Abdullah set up the Allegiance Council, a body that is composed of the sons and grandsons of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdulaziz, to vote by a secret ballot to choose future kings and crown princes. The council's mandate was not to have started until after the reigns of both King Abdullah and late Prince Sultan were over. It was not clear what was to happen when Prince Sultan died before the end of Abdullah's reign, leaving a question as to whether the council would vote for a new crown prince, or whether Prince Nayef would automatically fill that position. Despite such concerns, Prince Nayef was appointed Crown Prince on 27 October 2011 after consultation with the Allegiance Council by Abdullah. In November 2010, Prince Nayef chaired a cabinet meeting because of the deterioration of the King's health. During the same month, King Abdullah transferred his duties as Commander of the Saudi National Guard to his son Prince Mutaib. King Abdullah is credited with building up the once largely ceremonial unit into a modern 260,000-strong force that is a counterweight to the army. The Guard, which was Abdullah's original power base, protects the royal family. This was suggested as an apparent sign that the elderly monarch was beginning to lessen some of his duties. King Abdullah was Commander of the Saudi National Guard from 1963 to 2010. He was Chairman of the Saudi Supreme Economic Council until 2009. He also continued to be the President of the High Council for Petroleum and Minerals, President of the King Abdulaziz Center For National Dialogue, Chairman of the Council of Civil Service, and head of the Military Service Council until his death in 2015. King Abdullah followed his father's (King Abdulaziz's) path in terms of marriage in that he married the daughters of the al Shalan of Anizah, al Fayz of Bani Sakhr, and al Jarbah of the Iraqi branch of the Shammar tribe. King Abdullah had about 30 wives, and fathered about 35 children. One of his wives is the sister of Rifaat al-Assad's wife. He also married Jawahir bint Ali Hussein from Al Jiluwi clan, with whom he had a daughter, Princess Anoud and a son, Prince Saud. Aida Fustuq was another wife of Abdullah, they had two children, Adila and Abdulaziz. They divorced later. Munira bint Abdullah Al Al Shaykh was the wife of King Abdullah and gave birth to his eldest living son, Prince Khaled. Tathi bint Mishan al Faisal Al Jarba gave birth to Prince Mishaal. King Abdullah's eldest son, Prince Khalid, was deputy commander of the Saudi Arabian National Guard West until 1992. His second son, Prince Mutaib, is former commander and current minister of the National Guard. His mother is Munira Al Otaishan. Prince Mishaal was governor of the Makkah Province (2013\u20132015). Prince Abdulaziz was the king's former Syria adviser and has been deputy foreign affairs minister since 2011. Prince Faisal is head of the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent Society. King Abdullah's seventh son, Prince Turki, who was a pilot in the Royal Saudi Air Force, was governor of the Riyadh Province (2014\u20132015). The youngest son, Prince Badr, was born in 2003, when Abdullah was about 79 years old. In October 2015, his son, Prince Majed bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, was arrested in Los Angeles for using cocaine, being drunk, threatening female employees, and forcing them to watch him having gay sex with a male employee. King Abdullah's daughter Princess Adila is married to Faisal bin Abdullah bin Mohammed. She is one of the few Saudi princesses with a semi-public role, and a known advocate of women's right to drive. She is also known as \"her father's public face\". One of Abdullah's younger daughters, Princess Sahab, was born in 1993. Sahab bint Abdullah married Khalid bin Hamad Al Khalifa, son of Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, on 6 June 2011. Princess Sahab is the daughter of the king from his wife of the Al-Jarbah tribe. From his marriage to Princess Alanoud Al Fayez (arranged when she was 15 without her having ever met him), whom he has now divorced, he had four daughters \u2013 Princesses Sahar, Maha, Hala and Jawahir. The four princesses have been under house arrest for the last 16 years, and are not allowed to leave the country. After media releases in March 2014, Sahar and Jawaher received no food or clean water for 25 days, lost 10 kilos each and their mother carried out weekly protests in front of the Saudi Arabian embassy in London, and about which Sahar and Jawaher released a video while under house arrest pleading for help from the international community. King Abdullah also had a daughter called Princess Nora who died in 1990 in a car accident. Princess Fayza is yet another daughter. She is the mother of Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasser Al Saud who was accused of murdering his servant Bandar Abdulaziz in London in 2010. King Abdullah was the half brother of both his predecessors, including King Fahd, and his successor, King Salman. The King had curtailed his activities from June 2010 with no clear explanation. Diplomats said there had been uncertainty about the extent of his health problems since Abdullah canceled a visit to France. In a television appearance in which he was seen to use a cane, King Abdullah said he was in good health but had something \"bothering\" him. In a visit by US diplomats to Saudi Arabia in April 2014 the Saudi King was seen connected to breathing tubes during talks, indicating increasing health problems. From 2010 to 2012 King Abdullah had four back surgeries. The first two of the surgeries were in New York, one in 2010 for a slipped disk and a blood clot pressing on nerves in his back and a second to stabilize vertebrae in 2011. The third one was in Riyadh in 2011. And the last one was also in Riyadh on 17 November 2012. In November 2010, his back problems came to light in the media. He had an \"accumulation of blood\" around the spinal cord. He suffered from a herniated disc and was told to rest by doctors. To maintain the Kingdom's stability, Crown Prince Sultan returned from Morocco during the King's absence. The King was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital after a blood clot complicated a slipped disc and underwent successful back surgery. The lead surgeon was Muhammad Zaka, who probably removed the herniated disk and performed a lumbar fusion. He subsequently had another successful surgery in which surgeons \"stabilized a number of vertebras\". He left the hospital on 22 December 2010 and convalesced at The Plaza in New York City. On 22 January 2011, he left the United States and for Morocco, and returned to the Kingdom on 23 February 2011. King Abdullah left Saudi Arabia on \"special leave\" on 27 August 2012. Al-Quds reported that he had an operation at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, on or before 4 September 2012, following a heart attack. However, there was no official report on this alleged operation \u2013 instead, it was announced that the King went on a private trip to Morocco, where he is known to frequent. The King returned to Saudi Arabia from Morocco on 24 September. Nearly two months later, in November 2012, King Abdullah underwent another back surgery in Riyadh and left hospital on 13 December 2012. A report in April 2014 stated that the King had around six months left to live, citing a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer. On 2 January 2015, Abdullah was hospitalized in Riyadh for pneumonia and died on 23 January at the age of 90. Per Islamic tradition, his funeral was held the same day, a public ceremony at the Grand Mosque of Riyadh before burial in an unmarked grave at the Al Oud cemetery. Three days of national mourning were declared, in which flags would fly at half mast. Flags were also flown half-mast at Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey in London. While still Crown Prince, Abdullah paid for the separation surgery of a pair of Polish conjoined twins, which took place at the King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh on 3 January 2005. He was given \"honorary citizenship\" by the Polish town of Janikowo, where the twins were born. On 18 March 2005, he was awarded the Order of the Smile, which he received during his visit to Poland in 2007. He established two libraries: the King Abdulaziz Library in Riyadh; and another in Casablanca, Morocco. He donated over $300,000 to furnish a New Orleans high school rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina. He donated $500 million to the United Nations World Food Programme in 2008. He donated $50 million in cash and $10 million worth of relief materials for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China. He donated $10 billion to the endowment fund of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in May 2008. King Abdullah was, in 2012, named as the most influential Muslim among 500 Muslims for the previous 4 years. In December 2012, Forbes named him as the seventh most powerful figure in its list of the \"World's Most Powerful People\" for 2012, being the sole Arab in the top ten. King Abdullah received a number of international high orders. Most notably, he was an honoured knight of the strictly Roman Catholic Order of the Golden Fleece (the Spanish branch), which caused some controversy. In April 2012, he was awarded by the United Nations a gold medal for his contributions to intercultural understanding and peace initiatives. Malaysia : Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (1982) Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (2003) In 2011, the financial magazine Forbes estimated his and his immediate family's documentable wealth at US$21 billion, making him one of the world's richest monarchs. Abdullah was an expert equestrian in his youth. His stables were considered the largest in Saudi Arabia, with over 1,000 horses spread throughout five divisions led by his son Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah. The King also owned Janadria Farm, a large complex located in the suburbs of Riyadh. For holidays, the King maintained a large palace complex with several residential compounds in Casablanca, Morocco. It is equipped with two heliports and is surrounded by large mansions on 133 acres of vegetation. \"King Abdullah collected news and commentary\".

He had a range of business interests in the UAE and India (in Tamil Nadu) including maritime shipping, real estate, insurance etc. He founded numerous schools, colleges, hospitals and university. He was one of the 24 Indians to feature in The 500 Most Influential Muslims, an annual publication which ranks the most influential Muslims in the world. Abdur Rahman was the Vice-Chairperson of Emirates Trading Agency (commonly known as ETA Star) and Ascon Group, a Dubai-based conglomerate from 1973 to 2015. He is the founder of B. S. Abdur Rahman University (earlier named Crescent Engineering College), one of the first private owned engineering colleges in Chennai.

He died on 7 January 2015 at the age of 87. Abdur Rahman pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organisations and concentrates on upliftment of economically weaker sections through the Seethakathi Trust & Zakaat Fund Foundation. B. S. Abdur Rahman was born in Kilakarai, Tamil Nadu, India, in a middle-class Marakkar family, the son of Bhukari Aalim. His father was a prominent Pearl Trader in South Asia. He completed his Secondary School Level at Schwartz School, Ramanathapuram & Hameedia High School, Kilakarai. He was blessed with four sons and two daughters. He started his business in Sri Lanka with his elder brother Abdul Kader prominently called Thaika Vapa in Tamil Nadu. He had a sister and after her accidental death B. S.

At the age of fifteen, Abdur Rahman first went to Colombo with just \u20b9149. He worked as an errand boy for diamond merchants. He was at the time staying at rent-free accommodation with traders from Kilakarai but he had to fetch tea for them from a nearby hotel, clean the rooms and perform other menial tasks. A lesser person perhaps would have thrown in the towel. But Sena Aana was made of sterner stuff. Before long, he used his persuasive skills to obtain gemstones on credit from another merchant and began trading in them. In time he became a successful gem trader. The base that Abdur Rahman built in Ceylon was to help him in all his future activities. He began visiting Belgium, then as now, a centre of the gem trade, the USA, South America and set up business in Penang, Malaysia, Madras (now Chennai), Kolkata (then Calcutta), and then in Hong Kong. It was in Hong Kong that his business flourished. Incidentally, Abdur Rahman was the first person from Kilakarai to go to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong he launched the Precious Trading Company in 1954. Later, his very special brainchild, the Amana Group of Hong Kong, was established. It was under its banner that the multi-national company ETA-Ascon came into existence. BSA Rahman is credited as production facilitator in MGR Pictures' Ulagam Sutrum Valiban for film shoot in Hong Kong. ETA Group was started in Dubai in 1973 as a partnership with a friend, Abdullah Al-Ghurair, Chairman of the Al Ghurair Group of companies. The global asset bubble triggered by Nixon Shock catapulted him into a rupee billionaire in the 1970s; and diversification made him a dollar billionaire by the 1990s. Originally a civil construction contractor, ETA-Ascon expanded into trading, elevator and electrical installations, real estate, mechanical engineering, building maintenance, car dealerships, and, most recently, shipping and aviation. It employs over 54,000 people across 16 industry verticals. ETA-Ascon is today the flagship of BSA Rahman's vast industrial empire.

Ben Abraham spent the next two years being transferred between several American hospitals in Germany, eventually achieving a full recovery. According to him \"It was a miracle; that time tuberculosis cure did not even exist\". In 1947, after his recovery he clandestinely immigrated to Palestine. There Abraham witnessed another conflict, The War of Independence of the Israel State. He was not admitted to the army due to his health, so he bought an old truck and worked for the Israeli army as a driver. Abraham arrived in Brazil on January 21, 1955.

In 1957, he became apprentice to the Fiorini Bronze Foundry, and went on to work as a display artist for Adel Rootstein. His first show, in 1960, was at the Portal Gallery with Peter Blake. Through Eduardo Paolozzi, he was included in the landmark 1961 ICA exhibition 26 Young Sculptors, together with Phillip King and Maurice Agis, friends from the St Martin's days. By the late 1960s Abrahams had found inspiration in the imagery of domestic gardens. As well as bronze, he started using new material for his work, nylon flocking, pre-vulcanized latex, styrene and plastics. After a solo show at the Richard Feigen Gallery in New York in 1970, he established his international reputation with a major museum show at the Kolnisher Kunstverein Cologne in 1973. In 1975, he met James Mayor who invited him to show the following year at the Mayor Gallery, thus beginning an association which continued till his death. Abrahams' print output includes his garden series and suites celebrating Edmund Burke and Edgar Allan Poe showcased in a Royal Academy exhibition in 2010. His body of prints was published by Bernard Jacobson who regularly exhibited his work in London and the US. In 1982, Bryan Robertson organised an exhibition of the sculptures at the Warwick Arts Trust and in 1984 he was invited to mount his first sculpture retrospective at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Abrahams' post-Cubist architectural structures of the 90s resulted in a commission by the Goodwood Sculpture Park and the purchase of the bronze 'Head of the Stairs' by the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea. In the 2000s a series of owls and cockerels, using various media, including enamel on steel epoxy resin and decal, culminated in the 2005 Mayor Gallery exhibition 'A Parliament of Owls'. 2007 saw a mini retrospective entitled 'The Four Seasons of Ivor Abrahams' at One Canada Square in Canary Wharf. In 2008 the Henry Moore Institute mounted an exhibition of early work untitled 'By Leafy Ways' showing the 1972 film of the same name, which prompted a reintroduction of the Garden image. In 2012, a retrospective at the Royal West of England Academy was accompanied by an Andrew Lambirth monograph: Eden and Other Suburbs, the Life and Work of Ivor Abrahams.

H. Abrams, was an American literary critic, known for works on romanticism, in particular his book The Mirror and the Lamp. Under Abrams's editorship, The Norton Anthology of English Literature became the standard text for undergraduate survey courses across the U. S. and a major trendsetter in literary canon formation. Abrams was the son of Eastern European Jewish immigrants in Long Branch, New Jersey. The son of a house painter and the first in his family to go to college, he entered Harvard University as an undergraduate in 1930. He went into English because, he says, \"there weren't jobs in any other profession. . . , so I thought I might as well enjoy starving, instead of starving while doing something I didn't enjoy. \" After earning his bachelor's degree in 1934, Abrams won a Henry Fellowship to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his tutor was I. A. Richards. He returned to Harvard for graduate school in 1935 and received a master's degree in 1937 and a Ph. D. in 1940. During World War II, he served at the Psycho-Acoustics Laboratory at Harvard. He describes his work as solving the problem of voice communications in a noisy military environment by establishing military codes that are highly audible and inventing selection tests for personnel who had a superior ability to recognize sound in a noisy background. In 1945 Abrams became a professor at Cornell University. The literary critics Harold Bloom, Gayatri Spivak and E. D. Hirsch, and the novelists William H. Gass and Thomas Pynchon were among his students. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963. As of March 4, 2008, he was Class of 1916 Professor of English Emeritus there. His wife of 71 years, Ruth, predeceased him in 2008. He turned 100 in July 2012. Abrams died on April 21, 2015 in Ithaca, New York, at the age of 102. Abrams shows that until the Romantics, literature was typically understood as a mirror reflecting the real world in some kind of mimesis; whereas for the Romantics, writing was more like a lamp: the light of the writer's inner soul spilled out to illuminate the world. In 1998, Modern Library ranked The Mirror and the Lamp one of the 100 greatest English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century. Abrams was not only the general editor of The Norton Anthology, he was the editor of The Romantic Period (1798\u20131832) in that anthology, and he evaluated writers and their reputations. In his introduction to Lord Byron, he emphasized how Byronism relates to Nietzsche's idea of the superman. In the introduction to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Abrams said, \"The tragedy of Shelley's short life was that intending always the best, he brought disaster and suffering upon himself and those he loved. \"To be clear, this anthology of \"English\" literature does not include Anglophone writers from places such as Canada, but it does include writers from various places in the British Isles, for instance, William Butler Yeats, who was appointed a senator in the Irish Free State. Literary theories, Abrams argues, can be divided into four main groups: Mimetic Theories (interested in the relationship between the Work and the Universe) Pragmatic Theories (interested in the relationship between the Work and the Audience) Expressive Theories (interested in the relationship between the Work and the Artist) Objective Theories (interested in close reading of the Work) The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition (1953) ISBN 978-0-19-501471-6 The Poetry of Pope: a selection (1954) ISBN 978-0-88295-067-9 Literature and Belief: English Institute essays, 1957.

He was member of the House of Representatives between 1989 and 1997 for the Islamic Action Front. He was an opponent of the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty and a supporter of Hamas. Abu Zant frequently criticized the Western world and especially the United States and Israel. He was also critical of moderate Islamic regimes in the Middle East. Abu Zant had confrontations with the Jordanian government several times. He was banned from delivering sermons in 1994 and was arrested several times for breaching that prohibition the same year. Critique of government actions against Hamas had him arrested in 1999 and 2001. Abu Zant was born in Nablus. At one point he became member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was elected to the House of Representatives during the 1989 Jordanian general elections. Abu Zant was a member of the House between 1989 and 1997 (or 1990 and 1998) for the Islamic Action Front (IAF), serving during three parliaments. Abu Zant called himself the leader of the most radical section of the party. Within the IAF Abu Zant had a sizeable group of followers. During his time in parliament Abu Zant supported introducing prohibition as well as a mandatory headscarf for Muslim women. When female Representative Faisal kept her own style of dress in parliament Abu Zant offered her an Islamic garb and sweets to stop wearing her own clothes and make-up. Abu Zant was an opponent of the Coalition forces during the Gulf War. He called the Gulf War: \"not a war between Iraq and the U. S. , but rather one between Islam and the infidels\". He subsequently called for a jihad against Western forces involved in the Gulf War. Abu Zant called the Arab regimes that took part in the Gulf War against Iraq apostates. During and after the Gulf War Abu Zant was a frequent speaker at Friday preaching ceremonies at mosques. In 1994 Abu Zant was prohibited from delivering sermons by the Ministry of Awqaf Islamic Affairs and Holy Places, after he criticized the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty, which had been signed that year. The same year he violated his prohibition when he spoke in a mosque criticizing the peace treacy. A scuffle occurred in which Abu Zant was injured, with Abu Zant and his followers and other preachers claiming the police acted violently, while the police blamed the followers of the official imam of the mosque, Sami al-Najjar, who had been prevented from delivering his own speech by Abu Zant. He later criticized official clerics in parliament, claiming that they were asking God to be merciful on Israelis, with Abu Zant referring to the Israelis as \"the killers of all God's emmissaries and prophets\". Shortly afterwards Abu Zant was arrested for criticizing an Amman court which was holding trials against people claimed of disturbing the peace during anti-peace treaty demonstrations. In 1994 Abu Zant wrote several articles in the newspaper Al Arab Al Yawm, which led to chief editor's arrest, as well as his own. In late November the two men were brought before a court on charges of slandering Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali. In September 1999 the governor of Amman, Qaftan Majali, asked Abu Zant to sign a pledge withholding him from keeping pro-Hamas speeches. Abu Zant refused and was placed under administrative arrest. In total he was arrested three times during the month for violating the Sermons Law of Jordan. Shortly before his arrest he had criticized a government crackdown on Hamas supporters, which happened in August. The Muslim Brotherhood subsequently demanded his release. During his life Abu Zant had been expelled from Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as his voiced opinions were deemed to radical. In 2001, with tensions relaxing between Israelis and Palestinians and a possible peace deal ahead, Jordan launched actions against Hamas. Both the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Action Front protested against these, although the protests were not large. Abu Zant however did protest fiercely, accusing the Jordanian government of collaborating with the United States and the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, which led to him being arrested. In 2014 during an interview on Al-Aqsa TV Abu Zant accused Jews of blood libel and cannibalism. Abu Zant died on 26 July 2015. Jordanian House Speaker Atef Tarawneh praised Abu Zant for his patriotism and dedication while being member of the House. Three days after his death Jordanian King Abdullah II visited Abu Zant's family to extend his condolences.

She is best known for co-creating Crossroads with Peter Ling. Hazel Joyce Willett was born in 1920 at Darjeeling, British India,, daughter of Ada \"Alma\" (Rhames) and Edward Willett, an engineer who work in Calcuta. At 9 months old, her British family returned to England, where her parents divorced in 1923, when she was two years old. Her mother later remarried Edward Hamblin, and she adopted his surname. In 1940, Hazel wed Gordon Mackenzie, a rancher from Brazil. The couple had one son Colin, afther WWII her husband returned to Brazil and they divorced in 1949. In 1950, Hazel remarried Ronald Marriott, an actor-writer, who died in 1972, and with whom she had 5 children. Using Adair as her stage name, she began her career as an actress with parts in the film My Brother Jonathan (1948) and the BBC television drama Lady Precious Stream (1950), originally a stage play by the British Chinese writer Hsiung Shih-I. She then turned her attention to writing scripts for radio and television. Together with her second husband, Ronald Marriott, she wrote Stranger from Space (1952), an episodic serial for the Whirligig children's television series. With Jonquil Antony (later Peter Ling), she wrote scripts for the radio soap opera Mrs Dale's Diary, and with Antony co-created ITV's first soap, Sixpenny Corner, which ran for eight months during 1955 and 1956, five days a week in a 15-minute slot. She formed a professional relationship with Peter Ling. The partnership created Compact (1962\u20135), based on her experiences working for Woman's Own, and the long-running Crossroads series. She recalled a working lunch with ATV head Lew Grade in August 1964 in which he requested the creation of a daily soap opera to be built around Noele Gordon, then in her mid-40s and under contract, to run from the following October. Adair and Ling quickly came up with the format, based around a widow, Meg Richardson, and her motel business. Despite limited production values, it became a hit, although a secondary storyline around the village shop of Richardson's sister was soon eliminated. Initially only screened in the Midland ATV franchise area from November, it was eventually taken up by the entire ITV network, and continued (in its original run) until 1988, although Adair's direct involvement lasted only until the mid-1970s. With Ling, she wrote for programmes such as Champion House (1967\u201368), which they also created, and for Doctor Who; the script by Adair and Ling for the latter was only produced as an audio book decades later. As a script writer on Emergency \u2013 Ward 10, she wrote what was long thought to be the first interracial kiss on television in Britain, broadcast in June 1964, but this has been found to be incorrect. Her other work, Compact, featured the first black actor to appear regularly (Horace James between August and October 1964) and the earliest unmarried mother in a soap, while Crossroads had the first black family to be included in the regular cast of a British soap. She had an intermittent career in the film industry. She wrote the script for Life in Emergency Ward 10 (1958), a spin-off film for which she was credited with the series' creator Tessa Diamond, and the Bob Monkhouse movie Dentist on the Job (1961) (with Hugh Woodhouse). In the 1970s she formed Pyramid Films with the broadcaster on wrestling, Kent Walton, with both adopting a joint nom de plume as the writers of the scripts. The company ventured into producing erotic films such as Virgin Witch (1971) and Game for Vultures (1979) and sex comedies such as Clinic Exclusive (1971) and Keep It Up Downstairs (1976). She drew on her experiences as an ambulance driver during second world war for a work of romantic fiction, Blitz on Balaclava Street (1983), published under the pseudonym of Clare Nicol. Adair was joint head of the Writer's Guild with Denis Norden and called a six-week strike in the 1960s, which eventually led Lew Grade agreeing to minimum wages and royalties for scriptwriters. She died on 22 November 2015, at the age of 95. She was survived by her six children, 11 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.

As late as 2013 he served as counsel to Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis LLP, and was listed as a NAFTA adjudicator. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Adams earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1941 from Temple University, a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1947, and a Master of Arts degree from Temple in 1950. While at Penn, he served as editor-in-chief of the law review. Adams worked in private legal practice in Philadelphia from 1947 until 1969. He also was a member of the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania from 1952 until 1956. He was a secretary of public welfare for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from 1963 to 1966. On September 22, 1969 President Richard Nixon nominated Adams to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that had been vacated by the decision by Judge Harry Ellis Kalodner to take senior status. The United States Senate confirmed Adams on October 1, 1969, and he received his commission on October 2, 1969. In 1971, President Richard Nixon came close to nominating Adams to the Supreme Court of the United States, but nominated William Rehnquist instead after the Third Circuit, in an opinion written by Adams, reversed the convictions of several nuns involved in an anti-Vietnam War protest. In 1975 Adams was considered by President Gerald Ford as a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. Adams was one of two finalists; Ford ultimately wound up successfully nominating the other finalist, John Paul Stevens. Adams retired outright from the bench (rather than taking senior status) on January 2, 1987. He returned to private practice, joining the firm Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis LLP. Adams was well known for his post-judiciary roles in significant legal cases. In 1994, he conducted an investigation of the Pennsylvania attorney general for alleged criminal activity, and investigated allegations of improper medical research at Fox Chase Cancer Center. Soon after in 1995, he was appointed to serve as a trustee in the New Era bankruptcy case, at that time the largest nonprofit bankruptcy in history. He also served as the Chapter 11 Trustee in the successful reorganization of the Coram Healthcare Corporation in the Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996. From 1998 to 2002, Adams served as independent counsel in an investigation of the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that uncovered widespread corruption. Adams service to society includes both legal and community capacities. Adams was a member of the Board of the Pennsylvania, and had previously served as a member of the board and Chairman of Albert Einstein Healthcare Network, trustee for the William Penn Foundation, the National Constitution Center, and Bryn Mawr College and President of the congregation for Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel.

J. Adams, also known as Bob Shannon (September 20, 1942 \u2013 January 26, 2015), was a Canadian film and television actor, acting coach, screen writer, film producer, documentary producer and radio personality. Adams was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, where he spent his early childhood, until his family headed across the border to Niagara Falls, New York. Known to his friends as Bob Adams, the aspiring actor/radio DJ spent just a couple of years attending Bishop Duffy High School before dropping out and moving to New York City at the age of 17 to study acting. Upon his arrival on the west coast, he landed a job as a page at NBC Burbank which led to a radio job in Phoenix and ultimately a twenty-five-year career in broadcasting as Bob Shannon. His on-air career included radio stations in markets such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Seattle, Minneapolis/St. Paul, San Diego and Los Angeles. It was while working at KFI (AM) in the mid-1970s that Adams turned his attention back to film acting. Adams began his 30-year radio career as Bob Shannon at KXIV Phoenix, Arizona until going full-time, thanks to the efforts of play-by-play announcer Al McCoy, who got him his first full-time on-air job at KBLU Yuma, Arizona. From there it was on to KUTY Palmdale, California before making the leap to KDWB St. Paul, Minnesota by the end of the year. It wasn't until Shannon arrived in Phoenix that he garnered his first major success at KRUX by rapidly climbing to number one in the market by beating all competitors by twenty plus points, utilizing a variety of crazy characters and outlandish antics such as the invasion of his show by the television rock group, The Monkees. The episode aired as the finale of the group's first season. Following his departure from Phoenix, Shannon held air shifts at WKBW Buffalo, New York and WKYC Cleveland, Ohio until landing the coveted early evening slot at KXOK St. Louis, Missouri where he again rose to the number one show in the market, beating his nearest rival by over twenty ratings points. Following St. Louis, Shannon joined a couple of famous stations, including KJR Seattle, Washington, WIXY Cleveland, Ohio and KDKA, before returning to KDWB Mpls/St. Paul as \"BS\" in the morning. It was here that he gained instant popularity by a myriad of stunts such as broadcasting live from the streets of the Twin Cities while distributing cans of beans during the gas shortage of the mid-1970s which he promoted as a \"natural gas substitute\". His name recognition eventually brought him to the attention of KFI Los Angeles in 1975, where he enjoyed several successful years doing afternoons as \"BS in Drive\". In 1976 Shannon with the help of his vast audience, as well as the national media, succeeded in persuading NOA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to adopt male hurricane names in an effort to bring equal hurricane rights to men. Up until that time hurricanes had only been named for women. His successful campaign brought about the naming of Hurricane David, the name of Shannon's son. From KFI, he went on to KHJ (AM) and KLAC, Los Angeles before retiring from radio in the mid-1980s to devote his attention to film acting. In 2000 Adams returned to the airwaves once again as Bob Shannon, this time joining the air staff of KRTH 101 in Los Angeles. He is not to be confused with a radio personality of the same name who is midday host on New York City's most popular radio station, classic-hits WCBS-FM. In 2003 he ventured into talk radio as host of Back Stage Live, a film and television call-in program specifically geared toward aspiring and professional actors on \"Smart Talk\" KRLA. In 2011, Adams played a serial-killing priest in a dark suspense thriller. From 1975 to 1978, Adams studied under acting coach Charles E. Conrad. He was cast in a variety of shows, including Hotel, The Practice, Archie Bunker\u2019s Place, General Hospital, Kojak and Hill Street Blues. From the 1980s to the 2000s, Adams appeared in dozens of film and television projects including Rocky IV, The Execution, Falling Through, and Murder, She Wrote, and was a series regular on Riptide. He starred in four feature films for which he wrote the screenplay: Abeo Pharisee, The Studio Club, Chasing Jose, and The Christmas Quilt. Shortly after leaving the Charles E. Conrad Studio in 1978, Adams began teaching a handful of actors from the local community college. That led to a 35-year coaching career at The Actors Workshop. His former students include Kristy Swanson, Brian Krause, Sarah Lancaster. Vicellous Reon Shannon, Schae Harrison, and Annet Mahendru. Adams appeared as a panelist for the Screen Actors Guild Foundation and conducted SAG-AFTRA acting workshops in Los Angeles and San Diego. In 1976, Adams founded Shannon & Company, which served Orange County and Los Angeles as a full service advertising agency until the company converted to a broadcast and film production company in the 1980s, focusing primarily on historical documentary projects and docudramas. The company rolled out a number of films, including Ruins of the Reich, The Missions of California, Order Castles of the Third Reich and The Final Journey. Ownership of Shannon & Company changed when R. J. Adams' son, Rob Adams, took control of the company in the spring of 2000 and steered the company toward the production of feature films and episodic television. Adams and his wife, Diane, were married for 47 years. His son, actor Rob Adams, is an acting coach at The Actors Workshop. Adams was an FAA licensed IFR/Commercial pilot and flew various planes ranging from the Cessna 150 to the Cessna CE 550 corporate jet. Adams died of a heart attack on January 26, 2015. He was 72. R.

Adeane was born in 1939 into a prominent landed family, the son of Michael Adeane (created a life peer as Baron Adeane in 1972) and Helen Chetwynd-Stapylton, the daughter of Richard Chetwynd-Stapylton. The family had a long history of service to the royal family. His maternal great-grandfather was Arthur Bigge, later Lord Stamfordham, private secretary to Queen Victoria and King George V. His paternal great-grandfather was Admiral Edward Stanley Adeane. Edward was educated at Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he graduated with an MA. He was a Page of Honour to The Queen from 1954 to 1956. In 1960\u20131961 he was a Plebiscite Supervisor in the Southern Cameroon. He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in July 1962, and specialised in libel until 1979. As a barrister he defended Time Out magazine, owned by Playboy Publications, Inc. , in 1973, when they had accused Fiona Lewis, an actress, of being involved with South American revolutionaries. She was awarded damages. The following year, he represented The Spectator magazine who had libeled publishers Jonathan Cape, suggesting they were in financial difficulties, and won a similar outcome in that case. In 1975 he was more successful in representing Marcia, Lady Falkender, who was falsely accused of forging the signature of her boss, former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. She was paid damages and costs. In 1977, Adeane represented Marlene Dietrich, the glamorous Hollywood actress, in a libel case brought by producer Alexander Cohen and Brentwood TV, of New York, for breach of contract, as a disreputable performer. Adeane was appointed Private Secretary and Treasurer to the Prince of Wales in May 1979 to succeed Sqdr Ldr David Checketts. Prince Charles and Edward Adeane shared a passion in angling on the River Test near Stockbridge, Hampshire. They were members of the Houghton Fishing Club, where Adeane continued to fish right up until his last days. On the engagement of Lady Diana Spencer and the Prince, she was due to arrive at Albany House, where Adeane had a barrister's set. The staff expected octogenarian Lady Diana Cooper, but were bemused to find a much younger lady arrive in her Mini Metro and park perfectly. Princess Diana had a nervous start in a royal household, where she dismissed almost all of the staff. Adeane was made the Princess's Treasurer in 1981 on their marriage. Adeane was granted the additional appointment as private secretary to the Princess in 1984, following Oliver Everett's resignation. The alleged trouble started during the 1983 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, when the Princess first expressed concern at leaving her children behind in London. The Daily Mirror reported her calling Adeane a \"fuddy-duddy\". When Adeane tried to plan a tour of Australia in 1984, he was accused of trying to manipulate State elections in Victoria for political purposes. In attempting to distance the Premier, Adeane was quoted in the Daily Mirror and other newspapers. The controversy behind the scenes stirred royal watchers to speculate that all was not well with the royal marriage when finally, the Prince and Princess of Wales stepped onto the Canberra tarmac early in October 1985. \"Obviously the key to this confusion will depend on whether Prince Charles wishes to adhere to the advice given in your letter of 15 May 1984, or not!\" exclaimed a rather uppity courtier. The prince had changed the itinerary on several points, leaving an exasperated secretary to make a number of public pronouncements. What made matters worse was what assistant secretary called a \"bombshell\" dropped by RAAF which refused to carry the royal couple from Heathrow, but could only pick up from Bahrain or Singapore. Angry at being told to 'wait around' at foreign airports, Prince Charles deplored the chaos, and ultimately 'heads would roll. ' It did not help matters that Major Ronald Ferguson, royal polo manager was embroiled in the disorganized mess on board. The Australians objected to the mounting costs to the taxpayer; and the Americans suggested that on their leg, the RAF pick them up from Washington DC. Ironically Prince Charles cut the itinerary down to avoid inappropriate and stressful visits and not cost. But the consequences added to the growing disharmony in the royal household, for which Adeane had primary responsibility. Adeane resigned after disagreements and accusations that he was taking decisions without consulting the prince, and being too much of the 'old school tie' about him. However Adeane found that the prince invariably did the opposite of what he was advised. An almost unprecedented state of affairs materialized on 19 March 1985, when the press were invited into Buckingham Palace to discuss relations. Evidently the last straw for Adeane he resigned on 31 March 1985. He was Equerry to the Prince of Wales 1979\u20131981, and was an Extra Equerry from 1985. He represented the Prince at Royal Household memorial services - and returned to practice at the Bar. His departure commenced a period of instability in royal sinecures, including the Queen's annus horribilis, with several private secretaries coming and going in short order. He was replaced by Sir John Riddell. Adeane may have lost the prince's favour, but he continued to be a regular guest of the Queen Mother at Birkhall every September for the grouse shooting season. From 1993 he was Trustee of the British Library, and trustee of the Leeds Castle Foundation 1991, and the Lambeth Palace Library 1991. A likeable man, and a popular figure, Adeane was not sporty at school but flourished in country pursuits later in life. He habitually ate out every meal, even at breakfast. He was a company director from 1985, including of Hanson since 1992; Hambros Bank 1986 (executive director, compliance since 1991); Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance 1985; English and Scottish Investors Plc 1986; and Hambros Channel Islands Trust Corp Ltd. Adeane was appointed a CVO in 1985. He died on 20 May 2015. Adeane never married and is survived by companion, Brent Snape.

Adik had a son and three daughters. He served as an Agriculture Minister in the Maharashtra Cabinet from 2003 to 2005. Govindrao Adik, was a close associate of Sharad Pawar before Pawar split from the Indian National Congress (INC) to form his independent base, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Like many leaders at the time, Adik remained in the INC after the split. He commands a substantial mass support in rural, specially western Maharashtra. Adik welcomed the appointment of Ashok Chavan as Chief Minister of Maharashtra and expressed hope that he would retain his clean image and put the party back on track. However, in 2009 Adik expected to be inducted into the state cabinet by the Chief Minister Ashok Chavan. A change was made during the final hour which brought another Congressman Shri Radhekrishna Vikhe Patil, the son of former Union Minister Shri Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, into the Cabinet. This sudden exclusion of his name from the list disappointed Adik, who had been expecting a Ministerial berth ever since 2005. As one of the longest serving leaders in the INC and a senior member, Adik felt abandoned by the party leadership. Expressing discontent about senior party members being isolated by the INC, in a letter to the United Progressive Alliance Chairperson, Sonia Gandhi, Govindrao Adik resigned from the Congress Party membership on the 29 February to join the NCP. On 15 March he addressed a rally in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra with the NCP President Sharad Pawar, where he urged the entire state to back the NCP.

Adkins (October 25, 1932 \u2013 July 16, 2015) was a professor emeritus of psychology and education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Adkins was born in Beirut, Syria (now Lebanon) to Turkish and Syrian missionaries Leslie John Adkins and Edith Sanderson. Adkins was a graduate of Phillips Academy and in 1955 became an alumni at Princeton University along with a classmate Ralph Nader. For 12 years, Adkins served in the US Navy starting from Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps and climbing up the ranks to a naval officer on the USS Salem and even serving on a flagship of the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean waters. While there, he also received training in Naval Justice School, served on various vessels as court marshal, and later became attendee of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Following his service, Adkins returned to Columbia, where in 1958 he got his master's degree in psychology. In 1963, after obtained his doctorate in counseling psychology from Teachers College, Columbia University, Adkins immediately joined its faculty in order to work on his Career Pattern Study. For one year, he moved to Harvard University where he spent at its Center for Personality, studying achievement motivation with David McClelland. After his short lived Harvard appointment, Atkins indulged into War on Poverty and worked with YMCA of the City of Greater New York. In 1966, Adkins became a founding faculty member of the York College, City University of New York, where he supervised the Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge project. The project later turned into a program whose goal is to provide support for low income students. The program is still used today by the City University System. During the next 30 years, Adkins worked at Teachers College, Columbia University and at the Institute for Life Coping Skills, where he developed new methods for helping people to deal with complex attitudes and behaviors they might encounter in their everyday life. His major focus was the development of multi-media counseling systems. Adkins then worked with Paul Sharar and Sidney Rosenberg to develop Training Resources for Youth, a program that was implemented by 2,000 agencies in 40 states ever since its founding in late 1970s. During his career, Adkins trained many graduate students on how to develop psychological and behavioral interventions, using his methods and theory. He served on many non-profit boards of directors, including the HOPE Program for the homeless, the NYS Advisory Group on Adult Education, the Greenwich Adult and Continuing Program and the Center for Insurance Research, and was a founding member of the Princeton Project '55 Center for Civic Leadership. Adkins is better known as a pioneer behind the Adkins Life Skills Career Development Program (ASLP), which was originally published by Psychological Corporation, a division of Harcourt Assessment. The program, which besides English comes in Spanish and Italian languages, helped over 1 million people to obtain degrees (and later jobs). The program was used by over 2,000 agencies in 45 states, which includes such facilities as prisons, homeless shelters, drug rehabilitation centers, welfare-to-work programs, economic opportunity centers and community colleges. Based off the program, the Institute for Life Coping Skills had trained over 5000 staff as Life Skills Educators who promoted the program in their own agencies. Later on, as many as 200 community colleges in India had adopted the Life Coping Skills curriculum which was used in their country to help students from rural provinces learn how to understand urban life.

Adrian moved from Canada to Vienna, Austria in 1972 where he became known for creating experimental artworks using radio and communications technologies. His work The World in 24 Hours, which connected artists in different cities and continents through telephone lines and radio, is considered to be one of the first experiments in online culture. Adrian is considered to be a pioneer in the field of telecommunications art and media art. Adrian was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on February 22, 1935. He moved to Vienna in 1972. Adrian was an early user of telecommunications and electronics technologies for artistic purposes. One of his earliest telecommunications projects, in collaboration with Bill Bartlett, was a work that used the business computer network of the company I. P. Sharp Associates, which Adrian had learned about and gained access to through fellow artist Norman White. Called Interplay, the piece was a telecommunications event that linked a dozen cities in Canada, the US, Australia, Austria and Japan on April 1, 1979. Following Interplay, Bartlett and Adrian organized and implemented of one of the first electronic mail systems for artists in 1979/1980. This again used the I. P. Sharp Associates computer network, this time from its Vienna office. Adrian was instrumental in setting up the system ARTBOX (later renamed to ARTEX) in 1979 for mail and media artists to use to communicate between each other. In 1982, Adrian organized Die Welt in 24 Stunden (The World in 24 Hours), a telecommunications work that used telephone lines and slow-scan television to link sixteen cities on three continents together. The piece is widely cited as an early example of networked electronic art and online culture. It was commissioned by and presented at Ars Electronica Linz. In 2009, Adrian was a co-recipient of the US$50,000 Nam June Paik Art Center Prize. Adiran died in Vienna on September 7, 2015.

Aeby (; August 16, 1923 \u2013 June 19, 2015) was an American environmental physicist most famous for having taken the only well-exposed color photograph of the first detonation of a nuclear weapon on July 16, 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test site in New Mexico. Jack Aeby was born on August 16, 1923 in Mount City, Missouri, United States. In 1942, Aeby joined the Manhattan Project by filling out an employment application in Albuquerque. He did a lot of jobs, including ferrying scientists and equipment between Albuquerque and Los Alamos. Though a civilian, he worked his way up into the SED (Special Engineering Detachment) in technician roles and eventually witnessed nearly 100 nuclear explosions. After getting his degree at UC Berkeley after the war, he returned, in the Health Physics Department. On July 16, 1945, Aeby took the only well-exposed color photograph of the first detonation of a nuclear weapon at the Trinity nuclear test site in New Mexico. While color motion pictures of the Trinity test were made, most were badly overexposed or damaged due to the fireball's tendency to blister and solarize the film. Aeby was a civilian assigned to the Physics Group 5 with Emilio Segr\u00e8 and Owen Chamberlain at the time his snapshot was taken. The photo was taken with a Perfex 33 with a 35mm lens, using a shutter speed of 1/100 at f4 and Anscochrome color movie stock film. Aeby was not an official observer at the test site, but was invited along to take informal photos of the work, which he had commonly done since he arrived at Los Alamos. He says he took the photos of the blast on a whim, \"it was there so I shot it\". He took the film, a non-standard piece of Ansochrome movie stock film, out of the camera that night at a local photo lab, and worked it through the 21 step procedure for color film developing. Later on, Los Alamos management asked him if they could keep the original negative \"for safe keeping\". It has since been lost. Aeby says in most uses of the photo it is reversed. This was done intentionally so that the asymmetrical fireball and cloud would look the same as other official pictures taken from the north; Aeby was on the south at the Base Camp when he took the picture. Aeby is a source for a story about a notable estimate made by Enrico Fermi at that test: As the shock wave hit Base Camp, Aeby saw Enrico Fermi with a handful of torn paper. \"He was dribbling it in the air. When the shock wave came it moved the confetti. \" Fermi had just estimated the yield of the first nuclear explosion at the equivalent of 10,000 tons of TNT. Later measures put the yield nearly twice as much, at 18. 6 kilotons. And this terrible new energy came from a plutonium ball weighing 13. 6 pounds. Aeby lived in the Espa\u00f1ola Valley in northern New Mexico with his wife Jeanne. They had 5 children. Aeby died at his home in Espa\u00f1ola in 2015.

Soshana was a full-time artist and traveled frequently, exhibiting her work internationally. During her journeys, she portrayed many well known personalities and her art developed in different directions. Her early period artwork was largely naturalistic in nature, showing landscapes and portraits. Later her style developed towards abstract art, strongly influenced by Asian calligraphy. Soshana Afroyim was born in 1927 as Susanne Sch\u00fcller in Vienna into a Jewish middle-class family. Her younger brother Maximilian was born two years later. Her father, Fritz Sch\u00fcller, owned a cufflink factory and her mother, Margarethe Sch\u00fcller, was a sculptor. Shoshana first went to the Rudolf Steiner School, but soon changed to the alternative Schwarzwald School. She started to paint and draw at a very young age. Her mother supported Shoshana's creativity and collected her works. At the age of eleven, Shoshana witnessed the annexation of Austria. \"I watched Hitler's triumphant entry to Vienna. I remember well how I looked out of the window (. . . ) and saw how he was welcomed by the cheering crowd as he drove in his open car (. . . ). I turned cold and was horribly frightened. \"The family decided to leave Austria. Fritz Sch\u00fcller, who had been born in Brno, had a Czech passport and left the country first. Margarethe, Shoshana and Maximilian fled to Switzerland, then Paris, where Fritz had waited for them and finally in 1939 they reached London, where they would stay two years. Shoshana attended the Northwood College and in 1940 the Chelsea Polytechnic School, where she had painting and drawing lessons and learned about fashion design. Due to the Blitz, the Schueller family had to take refuge in air-raid shelters almost every night. The experience was very stressful for Soshana. She expressed her stress and emotions through drawings. Soshana's father fled to Spain and via Tangier, followed by New York. In 1941 he managed to get an affidavit for his family and booked three tickets for the S. S. Madura, the last civil ship that would leave Europe. In 1941, Soshana, her mother and her brother arrived at Ellis Island. In New York City. She enrolled at Washington Irving High School and attended painting classes under the guidance of artist Beys Afroyim, future plaintiff-appellant in Afroyim v. Rusk. At the age of 17, she travelled against her parents' will with Beys Afroyim through America. To earn their living during these travels, they painted writers, musicians, statesmen and scientists like Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter, Lion Feuchtwanger, Theodore Dreiser and Hanns Eisler. When the United Nations Conference on International Organization was opened in May 1945 in San Francisco, the couple portrayed well-known delegates, such as the deputy chairman of the UdSSR national planning commission Vasilij Vasilevi\u010d Kuznecov. In 1945, Soshana and Afroyim married. In 1946. their only child Amos was born in New York. Because of Beys' activities within the Communist Party, the couple left the USA and spent nine months in Cuba, where Soshana had her first exhibition in 1948 at the Circulo de Bellas Artes, Havana. From that time on she used the name \"Soshana\", the nom de plume Afroyims gave her, meaning \"Lily\" in Hebrew (the more common spelling is Shoshana - \u05e9\u05d5\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4). After a short stay in the USA, they moved to Europe and eventually to Israel. The family was financially poor and Soshana didn't want to live her life as a traditional housewife. They divorced in 1950 with mutual consent. She returned with her son to Vienna in 1951. Soshana returned to Vienna with her son and eventually gave Beys full custody. In 1951, she enrolled at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna and in 1952 to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where she painted under the guidance of Prof. Sergius Pauser, Albert Paris G\u00fctersloh and Prof. Herbert Boeckl. Unhappy with academic art practice, she relocated in Paris, France in 1952. Upon relocation to Paris, Soshana lived and worked in the former studio of Andr\u00e9 Derain. She eventually moved into another studio at Impasse Ronsin next to Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. She became very close with the artist, whom she described as loving her \"like a daughter. \" Later, she lived in another studio that was previously owned by Gauguin. Soshana struggled financially as a full-time artist in Paris. She described it as a \"bittersweet time. \" She became acquainted with the artists Kupka, Auguste Herbin, Ossip Zadkine, C\u00e9sar, Pignon, Bazaine, Max Ernst, Yves Klein, Alexander Calder, Wifredo Lam, Sam Francis, Jean-Paul Sartre, Affandi, Lain Bangdel, and Marc Chagall. She considered Alberto Giacometti one of her best friends. In 1953, Soshana met the Zurich gallery owner Max G. Bollag, who became a major promoter of her work. In Paris, Soshana had multiple exhibitions in the Andr\u00e9 Weil Gallery and Salon d'Automne, the Salon des R\u00e9alit\u00e9s Nouvelles and the Salon de Mai, where she met Pablo Picasso for the first time. He invited her to visit him at his Villa in Vallauris and drew a portrait of her in 1954. In 1956, Soshana traveled through Asia. She had organised herself an invitation by for a Chinese Ministry of Culture to exhibit in Beijing and on her way to China, she visited India, Thailand, Cambodia and Japan, where became interested in and inspired by Indian philosophy, Hinduism and Buddhism. She was impressed by the art of calligraphy and learned art techniques on rice paper from Buddhist monks in Kyoto and Chinese painters in Hangzhou. The art of calligraphy became formative for her painting style. In 1957 she arrived in Beijing, where her exhibition took place in the Emperor's palace. In 1959 Soshana travelled through Africa, where she portrayed Albert Schweitzer in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, eventually returning to Paris. In the same year she became acquainted with the Italian artist Pinot Gallizio. They worked together in Paris and Alba del Piemonte, Italy. In a letter written by Gallizio, to his gallerist Otto and Heicke Van de Loo in Munich, he announced '20 paintings were made in September 1959 in Paris, together with Soshana', adding 'results formidable'. Through Gallizio, Soshana got in contact with the COBRA group, among others to Karel Appel and Asger Jorn. But because she is a woman, they did not accept her as a full member of the art group. Instead, Soshana started a collaboration with the O\u00b4Hana Gallery in London, where she had three exhibitions in 1959, 1960 and 1963. In 1962, she had an exhibition at Ch\u00e2teau Grimaldi in Antibes. In 1964, Soshana traveled to Mexico for various exhibitions, living many months in Cuernavaca, known as the \"City of Eternal Spring\" and a refuge for many artists and intellectuals of the 1960s. She became friends with Mexican artists such as Rufino Tamayo, Siqueiros, Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas and Mathias Goeritz. In 1965, she met Adolph Gottlieb for the first time and later in New York, they developed a deep friendship. In 1966, an exhibition of Soshana's work took place in the Palacio de Bellas Artes. During the course of her second trip around the world in 1968, Soshana visited the South Seas, the Caribbean, Thailand, Bali, Australia, India, Sikkim, Nepal, Afghanistan, Iran and Israel. In 1969, the Chogyal entrusted her with painting portraits of the king and the queen of Sikkim and the same year she became a member of the Theosophical Society. In 1972, Soshana moved to Jerusalem, where she planned four exhibitions in the Old Jaffa Gallery. But when the Yom Kippur War broke out, they were all cancelled. Soshana left Israel and moved 1974 to New York. From 1974 to 1985, she lived and worked in New York City. Before she moved into her studio in Queens, she stayed in the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan, where she was able to pay her rent with paintings. Soshana knew many people of the New York art scene, like Mark Rothko, Francesco Clemente, Joseph Hirshhorn and her close friend Adolph Gottlieb. Despite gaining international attention for her work and exhibiting frequently, Soshana felt unsatisfied with her living situation and uncomfortable in New York. She returned to Vienna in 1985. Upon her return to Vienna, she continued to travel until she had to stop due to health problems in 2005. Thereafter, she moved to a nursing home and continued to paint. She died on December 9, 2015. Her son, Amos, serves as her manager and promoter. In 2008, the Austrian National Library took over her creative estate, comprising manuscripts, photos, letters, documents etc. and made it available for public consultation. In her early work, Soshana links individual elements from the tradition of Fauvism with the compact, hermetic view of American Realism and is noticeably imbued with a spirit of youthful insouciance. Soshana received her first lasting artistic influences at an art school in New York City, starting at the age of fourteen. Before she started to create abstract paintings in the early 50's, she painted in a style of colorful, archaizing Realism. A style, which is connected to the political art in the period around 1945, as a minor transition phase between the earlier and more famous Realisms of the 1930s (New Objectivity, Verismo, Precisionism, Magical Realism, etc. ) and the abstract painting of the 1950s. Already the bombings of the London Blitz, had triggered artistic reflections in the drawing of the budding artist Soshana. Her teacher in New York and later husband Beys Afroyim, who was a committed Communist, led her much deeper into narrative art and contemporary Social Realism. Afroyim and Soshana were very involved in the political activistic New York art circles, consisting mainly of European immigrants. On her travels with Beys Afroyim through the USA and later Cuba, Israel and Europe, Soshana painted street sceneries (e. g. Old Street in NY City, 1943, or Street in L. A. , 1945), factory workers (e. g. the series My Sweatshop in New York, 1944), people she met on the way(e. g. Two Black Youths, 1944, oder Young Man with a Straw, 1945) and many landscapes. Overmore she portrayed many artists and politicians (e. g. Franz Werfel on his deadbed, 1945, or Otto Klemperer, 1945). These portraits reflect the critical intellectual environment, the Afroyim couple moved in. All of the persons depicted have a distinctly melancholic look and are all either frontal or three-quarter-view portraits, which focus completely on the person represented. From the perspective of bold Social Realism, she interpreted the psychology of European immigrants in Los Angeles and European delegates to the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco. Soshanas working-class milieu studies on the other hand show a high affinity with famous regionalists and socialrealists such as Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, the Soyer Brothers or the Mexican Muralists Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera. Up to 1948, Soshana remained faithful to a compact, colorful and expressive Social Realism. In these early paintings, figures are modeled roughly with a few broad brush strokes without any detail; landscapes and citiscapes always open up to the beholder from a slightly elevated point of view. The scenes appear mostly in a neutral light, with neither houses nor figures casting shadows, yet these landscapes with the saturated application of colors, exude an almost cheerful mood, which can be interpreted as an echo of Fauvism. Soshana's paintings of European Alpine landscapes, which she began creating upon her return to Vienna in 1951, already show her first steps into Art Informel. When Soshana moved to Paris in 1952, she became part of the so-called \u00c9cole de Paris, a representative of the Paris School. Influenced by the intense contact with other artists from all over the world, Soshana turned her style from Expressive Realism into the Informel. Step by step she eliminated the object from her paintings and followed suit with the international art jargon of the time after 1945. Her Paris paintings are being connected with Abstract Expressionism and compared by experts to those of Jackson Pollock, Georges Mathieu and Hans Hartung. From the second half of the 1950s, Soshanas works increasingly show informel characteristics. Like so many other artists of her time, she was fascinated by Asian calligraphic aesthetics and the philosophy behind it. She had many Asian friends in Paris (e. g. Tobashi, Fujino, Walasse Ting) and made her first experiments with calligraphic techniques. But the decisive impulse for an intense engagement in studies of traditional Far Eastern art was her first journey to Asia in 1957. She learned how to use Chinese ink on paper and soon applied the new technique on her oil paintings. Although she devoted a big part of her work to the abstract art, Soshana never completely gave up the representational and kept interweaving occasional figures into her paintings. Many of Soshana's paintings contain Surrealistic motives, like an infinite horizon, expanded endless spaces, in which mysterious shapes, masks or heads seem to float. The use of an Surrealistic language is due to Soshana's travels to Mexico. In 1960 she made her first visit to that country, which was \u2013 due to its political antifaschist position - at that time particularly appealing for artists and intellectuals from Europe. Soshana is one of those \"children of the language of painting in Mexico\", a \"pintora filomexicana\". All her life she had a deep and magic connection with the country, which is also reflected in her work. The paintings she created in Mexico or are reminiscent of Mexico have a very special character, they hold within the typical flamboyant colors and the contrasts of that country. Soshana refined a technique, she once had developed by chance in her Paris studio years before, when it had rained through the leaky glass roof onto her watercolours and dried, leaving bright spots with dark edges. Soshana began to imitate this effect with turpentine on her oil paintings, the result was a \"kind of drip painting in reverse\" which resembled the structure of liquid crystal, as she describes herself: \"Some biochemists say that my paintings resemble what you see, when you look into a microscope\" A lonely figure, a dark silhouette or a single head between heavy bars, surrounded by wild strokes inside the perspective of a tunnel \u2013 motives like these run like a red thread through Soshanas whole work and have earned her a reputation as \"Cassandra of the canvas, a prophetess of doom, an artist of the Atomic Age, a painter of anxiety and loneliness, of disease and dementia, of unemployment, pain, and death. \" (The Mainichi, Japan 1957) Soshana was seriously affected by political events since her childhood. At the age of 11, she watched Hitler marching into Vienna, later the family had to flee from the Nazi regime. Soshana used drawing and painting as an outlet to deal with these traumatic events, like in a drawing, she called \"Hitler as Cloun\". Themes like The Cold War, the Yom Kippur War, the atomic age or terrorism can be found over and over again in Soshana's Oeuvre. When she returned to Vienna in 1985, she worked up the time of the Nazi regime and the Holocaust. During Kurt Waldheim's election campaign in 1987/88, she made a series of paintings and collages, in which she incorporated Nazi propaganda texts. Soshana also painted motive cycles of the wars in Yugoslavia, the attacks on the World Trade Center or the wars on Iraq. Reminiscences on earlier series of works and a process of compression can be clearly noted in Soshana's late work. From the 2000s on, her paintings get a very different character, the structures are more quiet, the colours clearer and the forms more simple. The motives sometimes even seem childish and naive, these pictures are little riddles full of irony and phantasy.

Because every man and every woman 'knows' what a woman is; therefore every man and every woman can claim the right to reduce the assessment of a woman's art to what she is like as a woman. \"At Soshana's time, an art career for a woman was by no means a matter of course. The goal of being able to support oneself by one's own art production seemed \u2013 not only for women \u2013 nearly impossible, which is why many aspiring women artists completed practical training in some other profession parallel to their art schooling. In most cases it was the teaching profession, which they practiced in art-related spheres. But Soshana chose her own independent self-determined and emancipated way, in an era in which the legal implementation of equal rights of men and women and equal opportunities to work in any profession was simply unthinkable. In a letter to the co-author of her autobiography, she writes about her role as a pioneer: \"This is why I want to write this book, to say what a struggle I went through to be a woman and an artist and be maybe like 100 years ahead of the times we actually live in. \"A good example of how hard it was as a woman artist on the market, is the fact, that even a revolutionary artist group like CoBrA, refused her as a member out of sexistic reasons. And the gallerist of her colleague Pinot Gallizio, with whom she made many paintings, did not want her to sign with Gallizio on the same work. In the manuscript of her autobiography, Soshana writes about the rejection she encountered also by other gallery owners: \"The owner of the Galerie de France told me in no uncertain terms, that they did not like to take woman artists on contract, it was considered too risky. A woman could get married, have children and abandon her career. Twenty years of publicity and a long-term financial investment in a female artist would be ruined over-night. Since this did not apply in my case, I felt the discrimination against women all the more. \"For a very long time, the role of a woman in arts was to be an inspiring muse, not to be a painter herself. But Soshana understood that she had to develop her own individual, unique artist image and knew very well how to practice successful self-management. She spread exciting, mysterious stories of her life and created a hype around her person. Her encounters with Picasso were told again and again - especially the story of the day, when she visited him in his villa in Vallauris, to be portrayed and the refused his invitation to stay with him. Soshana tried to use Picassos name to get more attention. The planned booktitel of a never finished autobiographical novel would have referred to that event: The Girl who said No to Picasso. Still Soshana later mentioned very often that she was torn between her pride of having said \"No\" and the regret, not to have chosen the easier and safe way at the side of a man.

He was known for his fiction centered on World War II, as well as his biographies and essays. Agawa was born in Hiroshima, Japan. As a high school student Agawa was influenced by the Japanese author Naoya Shiga. He entered the Tokyo Imperial University to study Japanese literature. Upon graduation in 1942, Agawa was conscripted to serve in the Imperial Japanese Navy, where he worked as an intelligence officer breaking Chinese military codes until the end of the war. He returned to Hiroshima, where his parents had experienced the atomic bomb, in March 1946. After World War II Agawa wrote his first short story Nennen Saisai (Years upon Years, 1946), which was a classic I Novel, or autobiographical novel, recounting the reunion with his parents. It follows the style of Naoya Shiga, who is said to have praised the work. August 6 as Agawa notes in a postscript, combines the stories of friends and acquaintances who experienced the bombing into the testimony of one family. Occupation censorship at the time was strict, but the story passed because, the author later observed, \"it made no reference to the problems of after-effect and continued no overt criticism of the U. S. \" Agawa came to popular and critical attention with his Citadel in Spring (\u6625\u306e\u57ce, 1952), which was awarded the Yomiuri Prize. (He later revisited the same theme of his experiences as a student soldier in Kurai hato (Dark waves, 1974)). Ma no isan (Devil's Heritage, 1953), a documentary novel, is an account of the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a young Tokyo reporter, handling, among other topics, the death of his Hiroshima nephew and survivors' reactions to the Atomic bomb Casualty Commission, the U. S. agency that conducted research on atomic victims. Agawa's four major biographical novels are Yamamoto Isoroku (\u5c71\u672c\u4e94\u5341\u516d, 1965), Yonai Mitsumasa (\u7c73\u5185\u5149\u653f, 1978), Inoue Seibi (\u4e95\u4e0a\u6210\u7f8e, 1986), and Shiga Naoya (\u5fd7\u8cc0\u76f4\u54c9, 1994). His other major works include Kumo no bohyo (Grave markers in the clouds, 1955), and Gunkan Nagato no shogai (The life of the warship Nagato, 1975). Agawa was awarded the Order of Culture (Bunka Kunsho) in 1999.

A self-taught photographer, Agou grew up in a small town in the Forez region, on the eastern side of the Massif Central. From the early 1990s, Agou made documentary-style photographs in both black and white and color which take an allusive approach to the human condition. He also made short films and sculpture. In 1992, he moved to New York City. He began taking photographs in the streets that evoked a sense of longing and isolation. He made photographs at Ground Zero on September 11th, 2001, which were used in numerous publications. He first came to prominence with photographs taken in the New York City Subway, published in his book Life Below (2004). In 2002 Agou returned to Forez. He traveled to the lesser-known parts of the region and got to know a community of family farmers whose identities are deeply rooted to the land. He photographed and filmed them at work and at home for eight years. This resulted in Face au Silence / In the Face of Silence, a documentary about rural life in early twenty-first century France. The work won him the 2010 European Publishers Award for Photography, and publication in six editions and in six languages. He became a member of the In-Public street photography collective in 2005.

He was the real-life son of lucha libre legend Perro Aguayo and not a storyline \"Junior\". Aguayo was best known as the leader of the Los Perros del Mal stable, which he started in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in mid-2004.

Aguayo died on March 21, 2015, due to a freak accident during a wrestling match, which was covered extensively by many news outlets across the world.

Aguayo's cousin works as \"Pepe Aguayo\", inspired by Perro Sr. Debuting professionally at the age of 15, Aguayo Jr. started out wrestling established veterans in AAA. He often teamed with his father, and the pair won the Mexican National Tag Team Championship on two occasions, defeating the teams of Fuerza Guerrera/Mosco de la Merced and El Cobarde II/El Cobarde Jr. , respectively. Aguayo Jr. worked his first major show on June 18, 1995, when he faced and lost to Juventud Guerrera as part of Tripleman\u00eda III-B. Aguayo Jr. formed a team of all \"juniors\", Los Junior At\u00f3micos, including Blue Demon Jr. , La Parka Jr. and M\u00e1scara Sagrada Jr. The four defeated Charly Manson, May Flowers, Nygma and El Picudo to win the Mexican National At\u00f3micos Championship during a show in Jalisco. Five months later they lost the championship to Los Vipers (Histeria, Maniaco, Mosco de la Merced and Psicosis) at the 1999 Verano de Esc\u00e1ndalo show. After Los Junior At\u00f3micos disbanded, Aguayo began teaming regularly with H\u00e9ctor Garza, engaging in a four-way storyline feud with Heavy Metal and Latin Lover. These four competed in various tag and four-way matches throughout the lengthy feud. One of the highlights of the storyline was Heavy Metal being shaved bald after losing a combination four-way steel cage match and lucha de apuesta on the 2001 Guerra de Titanes show, when Garza pinned Heavy Metal. Later on Latin Lover would defeat Garza in another lucha de apuesta. Aguayo Jr. and Garza defeated Los Vipers (Abismo Negro and Electroshock) to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship. The duo held the title for 61 days before losing it to Pirata Morgan and El Texano. In May 2003, Aguayo Jr. moved to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). He was initially brought in as a t\u00e9cnico to team with Negro Casas against Los Guerreros del Infierno, but did not receive the expected positive reactions from the crowd, and CMLL decided to turn him heel by having him win a tournament for a shot at Atlantis' Michinoku Pro Wrestling Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship. He won the tournament over established popular heels like Dr. Wagner Jr. and Rey Bucanero, so by the time he met the babyface Atlantis for the title, he was seen as a heel by the fans. The title challenge was unsuccessful, but Aguayo was quickly put into a program with Los Capos with the story being he was getting revenge on Universo 2000 for ending his father's career. During this feud, Shocker's popular Los Guapos group backed Aguayo Jr. and he became a face again. The feud continued through the winter and into 2004 and was ended when Aguayo and El Terrible (a member of Los Guapos) defeated Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 in a double hair vs. hair match at the 2004 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas: El Santo y Salvador Lutteroth show. In the spring, Aguayo Jr. once again backed up Negro Casas and Shocker in their feud with Pierroth Jr. , Vampiro Canadiense and Tarzan Boy. The two groups went at it in trios, singles, and tag matches before they were put in the annual \"Cage of Death\" match, in which the last two men in the cage, regardless of which team they are on, would face each other in a hair vs. hair match. The heel trio escaped early and Shocker made a quick exit as well. Aguayo Jr. and Casas then faced each other, and Aguayo Jr. pinned Casas, winning his hair. Tensions began to rise between Casas and Aguayo Jr. after that point, and when H\u00e9ctor Garza jumped to CMLL in July, Aguayo Jr. ditched Casas and joined him. After turning heel again, he took part in the Leyenda de Plata tournament, held in honor of El Santo. After securing his place in the semifinals, Aguayo Jr. interfered in Negro Casas' match with Atlantis, costing Casas the bout and allowing Atlantis to advance. After defeating Atlantis in the semifinals, Aguayo Jr. faced the previous year's winner, Felino, for the trophy. After Aguayo Jr. won the match, El Hijo del Santo came to the ring to award him the trophy, but Aguayo Jr. smashed it, claiming that Santo wasn't nearly the legend that Perro Aguayo Sr. was. The angle was hot and played off the feud the original Santo and Perro Aguayo had during the 1970s. Due to El Hijo del Santo's short tour with CMLL, the feud was rushed towards an indecisive singles match. The closest thing to closure for the feud was a trios match at the CMLL 71st Anniversary Show, during which the team of Hijo del Perro Aguayo, H\u00e8ctor Garza and El Terrible (soon to be named La Furia del Norte) defeated Hijo del Santo, Negro Casas and Shocker. After that match, Santo focused more on his program with Averno and Los Guerreros del Infierno and Aguayo Jr. set his sights on Casas (to whom he lost), and the feud cooled down from there. Starting in November 2004, Aguayo Jr. restarted his feud with Los Capos by teaming frequently with Vampiro and Pierroth Jr. , who were also feuding with Los Capos at the time. At the year-end show, he had another singles match with Universo 2000 which led to Aguayo's father running in and making the save. In February 2005, Perro Aguayo Sr. returned to wrestling for one match, teaming with his son against Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 in a double hair vs. hair match. The Aguayos won the match (which was also billed as Cien Caras' retirement match), in the main event of the 2005 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. After the match, La Familia de Tijuana (Halloween, Dami\u00e1n 666), and Aguayo Jr. decided to start a new faction, Los Perros del Mal (\"The Bad Dogs\"). Soon, the group would consist of Aguayo Jr. , La Familia, La Furia del Norte, Blue Demon Jr. , Pierroth Jr. and Pierroth's storyline sons. The group took on many rivals, including Negro Casas, Felino, Heavy Metal (who had just jumped from AAA), M\u00e1scara M\u00e1gica, Universo 2000 and Aguayo's new focus, the rising star M\u00edstico, who had defeated him in a main event singles match. The two agreed to a hair vs. mask match, but no date was specified. Los Perros del Mal faced off against their rivals in the 2005 \"Cage of Death\" match, in which Dami\u00e1n 666 took the hair of M\u00e1scara M\u00e1gica. On May 5, 2006, Aguayo Jr. was defeated by Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and El Canek in a three-way match for the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in Nezahualcoyotl. Aguayo Jr. 's final major feud in CMLL was with H\u00e9ctor Garza, which culminated in a Hair vs. Hair match on March 21, 2008, at Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, which Aguayo Jr. won via a low blow. Aguayo Jr. left CMLL in October 2008, along with fellow Los Perros Del Mal members Dami\u00e1n 666 and Mr. \u00c1guila, to start his own promotion called Perros del Mal Producciones. The new promotion's debut show took place on December 7, 2008, in Mexico City. On that show, Aguayo Jr. tag-teamed with Cibern\u00e9tico and Dr. Wagner Jr. to face L. A. Park, Ol\u00edmpico and Headhunter A, and was victorious. On June 6, 2010, at Tripleman\u00eda XVIII, Aguayo returned to AAA to lead Perros del Mal in an invasion of the promotion. The group quickly aligned themselves with Konnan and Dorian Roldan's La Legi\u00f3n Extranjera, La Milicia and Los Maniacos to form La Sociedad. On August 14 at Verano de Escandalo El Hijo del Perro Aguayo wrestled his first major match for AAA since his return, when he, L. A. Park and Dami\u00e1n 666 defeated El Mes\u00edas, Cibern\u00e9tico and La Parka in a six-man tag team match, when Perro pinned Mes\u00edas. On October 1 at H\u00e9roes Inmortales IV El Mes\u00edas defeated Perro in a singles match. Afterwards, Aguayo injured his knee, sidelining him for the rest of the year. However, he made a surprise appearance on December 5, 2010 during the main event of Guerra de Titanes, helping Dami\u00e1n 666, Halloween and X-Fly hand Los Psycho Circus their first-ever loss in a steel cage weapons match. On March 18, 2011, at Rey de Reyes, Aguayo Jr. joined Dami\u00e1n 666, Halloween and Super Crazy in a winning effort against Potencia Mundial (Dr. Wagner Jr. and Los Psycho Circus); Aguayo Jr. pinned Wagner with La Lanza, following a chair shot. On April 8, 2011. Aguayo Jr. underwent emergency surgery to remove a golf ball-sized tumor from his stomach. During the surgery, a peptic ulcer burst, and he was placed in an intensive care unit at the hospital in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Aguayo Jr. was released from the hospital on April 19 and was scheduled to receive treatment for his condition for a full year. Aguayo's tumor was found to be benign; Aguayo made his return to AAA, in a non\u2013wrestling role, on May 1 and returned to the ring on May 8 in a six-man tag team match pitting Los Perros del Mal against Los Psycho Circus; Aguayo pinned Psycho Clown after a low blow. The feud continued on May 29 at Perros del Mal Producciones' third anniversary show, when Los Psycho Circus defeated Los Perros del Mal in a six-man tag team steel cage mask vs. hair match. As a result, Super Crazy, the last man left in the cage, was shaved bald. Aguayo Jr. was set to wrestle as part of Los Perros del Mal at Tripleman\u00eda XIX, facing Los Psycho Circus to determine the first-ever AAA World Trios Champions, but was forced to pull out of the event due to an adverse reaction to the medication given to him as part of his tumor treatment. Aguayo returned on July 24 at a Perros del Mal event, teaming with Dami\u00e1n 666 and Halloween against Blue Demon Jr. , Cassandro and L. A. Park; the match ended in a no contest when Park turned on his partners. Aguayo Jr. next returned to AAA on August 19, replacing L. A. Park and teaming with Dami\u00e1n 666 and Halloween against El Mes\u00edas, Joe L\u00edder and El Zorro in a six-man tag team match, which they lost via disqualification when L\u00edder was attacked by his former tag team partner Nicho el Millonario. After the match, Aguayo officially named Nicho the newest member of Los Perros del Mal. Aguayo Jr. returned to pay-per-view on October 9, 2011 at H\u00e9roes Inmortales, unsuccessfully challenging Dr. Wagner Jr. for the AAA Latin American Championship in a bullterrier match. Afterward, Aguayo Jr. began a feud with Jack Evans. On December 16, 2011 at Guerra de Titanes, Aguayo and Evans continued their rivalry in a six-man tag team match, during which they busted each other open. The match was won when Aguayo Jr. 's teammate H\u00e9ctor Garza pinned F\u00e9nix. The feud between Aguayo Jr. and Evans continued through to Rey de Reyes on March 18, 2012, when Aguayo Jr. pinned Evans to win the Rey de Reyes tournament and earn a chance to contend for the AAA Mega Championship. On August 5 at Tripleman\u00eda XX, Aguayo Jr. unsuccessfully challenged El Mes\u00edas for the AAA Mega Championship. Afterwards, Aguayo Jr. started a year-long rivalry with Cibern\u00e9tico, which culminated in a lucha de apuesta in the main event of Tripleman\u00eda XXI on June 16, 2013. Aguayo Jr. was victorious, forcing Cibern\u00e9tico to have his head shaved bald. In August 2013, Aguayo teamed with Cibern\u00e9tico against his former stable, La Secta. On October 18 at H\u00e9roes Inmortales VII, La Secta eliminated Aguayo Jr. , Cibern\u00e9tico, and El Mes\u00edas from the Copa Antonio Pe\u00f1a, which led to the three retaliating by costing Secta members Dark Escoria and Dark Espiritu their match for the AAA World Tag Team Championship. Aguayo Jr. 's tecnico turn was completed on November 22, when Los Perros del Mal members Daga and Psicosis turned on him, labeling him a traitor for teaming with Cibern\u00e9tico. However, on December 8 at Guerra de Titanes, Aguayo Jr. turned on Cibern\u00e9tico, rejoined Daga and Psicosis and brought Los Perros del Mal back under the umbrella of the reformed La Sociedad. On August 17, 2014, at Tripleman\u00eda XXII, Aguayo Jr. started a new feud with the debuting El Patr\u00f3n by attacking him and his father Dos Caras at the start of the show. Later that night in the main event, Aguayo Jr. defeated Cibern\u00e9tico, Dr. Wagner Jr. and Myzteziz, in a four-way elimination match to win Copa Tripleman\u00eda XXII. After the match, Aguayo Jr. was immediately attacked by El Patr\u00f3n. Subsequently, Aguayo Jr. and El Texano Jr. defeated El Patr\u00f3n and El Mes\u00edas at H\u00e9roes Inmortales VIII. In subsequent months, Aguayo Jr. focused on Myzteziz, and resuming the storyline that started in CMLL when Myzteziz was known as M\u00edstico, by issuing a challenge for a mask vs. hair match at Tripleman\u00eda XXIII. The story led to the main event of the 2015 Rey de Reyes, in which Aguayo Jr. teamed up with Pentag\u00f3n Jr. , only to lose to Myzteziz and the returning Rey Mysterio Jr. . On March 20, 2015, Aguayo wrestled a tag team match, teaming with Manik against Rey Mysterio Jr. and Xtreme Tiger at a show for The Crash promotion in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. During the match, Mysterio used a headscissors takedown to propel Aguayo out of the ring, but Aguayo returned to the ring, upon which Mysterio dropkicked Aguayo in the back/shoulder to set up for Mysterio's signature 619 as Aguayo landed on the middle rope (the proper position for the 619). Manik then fell onto the middle rope beside Aguayo\u2014when Aguayo appeared to be limp and unconscious, Manik shook him slightly to revive him. Mysterio performed the 619, but did not hit either opponent. While the match continued, Konnan, who was at ringside, then attempted to revive the seemingly unconscious Aguayo by shaking him. The match still continued, with Mysterio next checking on the unmoving Aguayo, bringing it to the referee's attention. The match continued, with Mysterio pinning Manik at the center of the ring while Konnan again attempted to revive Aguayo. With the match over, various personnel went to Aguayo, believing he was just unconscious and in need of medical help. Officials later brought Aguayo out of the ring. When paramedics arrived, Aguayo was brought to the local Del Prado hospital, where he was pronounced dead around 1:00am on March 21. Aguayo was 35 years old. According to the initial statement by the hospital, Aguayo died from a cervical spine trauma, reportedly as a result of the dropkick by Mysterio Jr. that propelled him forward to the ring ropes, causing severe whiplash trauma that snapped his neck. The cause of death was later determined as cardiac arrest, due to a cervical stroke caused by three fractured vertebrae. Autopsy results showed that Aguayo Jr. broke his C1, C2, and C3 vertebrae. The coroner stated that the fractures took place at two different moments of impact and that Aguayo died almost instantly. Aguayo Jr. was not immediately attended to by a physician and was actually taken from the ring on a piece of plywood instead of a stretcher, which led to some criticism of the event organizers. However, the coroner stated that it made no difference. The Tijuana wrestling commission later explained that the doctor was backstage, attending to two other injuries that happened during the show. One of those injuries was a spinal injury and they did not want to remove that wrestler from the stretcher he was on, which was why they used the plywood to move Aguayo from the ring. The doctors worked on resuscitating Aguayo for over an hour before declaring him dead. On March 21, the attorney general for Baja California conducted an investigation into Aguayo's death but no criminal charges were filed. Aguayo Jr. was buried in Guadalajara on March 23 with Konnan and Rey Mysterio Jr. serving as pallbearers. After his death, the Comisi\u00f3n de Deporte del Senado del M\u00e9xico (The Commission of Sport of the Mexican Senate) presented the initiative \"Ley para la Seguridad del Deporte en el Pa\u00eds\" (Law for the Safety of Sport in the Country\"). Many promotions, including AAA, CMLL, The Crash, Lucha Underground and World Wrestling League (WWL), paid tribute to Aguayo Jr. following his death. On August 9 at Tripleman\u00eda XXIII, Aguayo Jr. was inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame.

He served as music director of the La Scala opera house in Milan, principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, music director of the Vienna State Opera, founder and director of Lucerne Festival Orchestra, music director of European Union Youth Orchestra and principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra. The Abbado family for several generations enjoyed both wealth and respect in their community. Abbado's great-grandfather tarnished the family reputation by gambling away the family fortune. His son, Abbado's grandfather, became a professor at the University of Turin. His grandfather re-established the family's reputation and also showed talent as an amateur musician. Born in Milan, Italy on June 26, 1933, Claudio Abbado was the son of violinist Michelangelo Abbado, and the brother of the musician Marcello Abbado (born 1926). His father, a professional violinist and a professor at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory, was his first piano teacher. His mother also was an adept pianist. Marcello Abbado later became a concert pianist and teacher at the Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro. His sister also exhibited talent in music, but did not pursue a musical career after her marriage. His other brother later became a successful architect. Abbado's childhood encompassed the Nazi occupation of Milan. During that time, Abbado's mother spent time in prison for harbouring a Jewish child. This period solidified his anti-fascist political sentiments. Claudio himself is known for having a famous anecdote about how when he was just twelve years old he wrote \"Viva Bart\u00f3k\" on a local wall which caught the attention of the Gestapo and sent them on the hunt for the culprit. His passionate opposition to fascism continued into his adult years. However, his musical interests also developed, with attendance at performances at La Scala, as well as orchestral rehearsals in Milan led by such conductors as Arturo Toscanini and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. He later recalled how he hated seeing Toscanini in rehearsal. Other conductors who influenced him were Bruno Walter, Josef Krips and Herbert von Karajan. It was not until hearing Antonio Guarnieri's conducting of Claude Debussy's Nocturnes that Abbado resolved to become a conductor himself. At age 15, Abbado first met Leonard Bernstein when Bernstein was conducting a performance featuring Abbado's father as a soloist. Bernstein commented, \"You have the eye to be a conductor. \" Abbado studied piano, composition, and conducting at the Milan Conservatory, and graduated with a degree in piano in 1955. The following year, he studied conducting with Hans Swarowsky at the Vienna Academy of Music, on the recommendation of Zubin Mehta. Abbado and Mehta both joined the Academy chorus to be able to watch such conductors as Bruno Walter and Herbert von Karajan in rehearsal. He also spent time at the Chigiana Academy in Siena. In 1958, Abbado made his conducting debut in Trieste. That summer, he won the international Serge Koussevitzky Competition for conductors at the Tanglewood Music Festival, which resulted in a number of operatic conducting engagements in Italy. In 1959, he conducted his first opera, The Love for Three Oranges, in Trieste. He made his La Scala conducting debut in 1960. In 1963, he won the Dimitri Mitropoulos Prize for conductors, which allowed him to work for five months with the New York Philharmonic as an assistant conductor to Bernstein. Abbado made his New York Philharmonic professional conducting debut on 7 April 1963. A 1965 appearance at the RIAS Festival in Berlin led to an invitation from Herbert von Karajan to the Salzburg Festival the following year to work with the Vienna Philharmonic. In 1965, Abbado made his British debut with the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, followed in 1966 by his London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) debut. Abbado taught chamber music for 3 years during the early 1960s in Parma. His early advocacy of contemporary music included conducting the world premiere of Giacomo Manzoni's Atomtod, on 25 March 1965, in Milan. In 1969, Abbado became principal conductor at La Scala. Subsequently, he became the company's music director in 1972. He took the title of joint artistic director, along with Giorgio Strehler and Carlo Maria Badini, in 1976. During his tenure, he extended the opera season to four months, and focused on giving inexpensive performances for the working class and students. In addition to the standard opera repertoire, he presented contemporary operas, including works of Luigi Dallapiccola and of Luigi Nono, in particular the world premiere of Nono's Al gran sole carico d'amore. In 1976, he brought the La Scala company to the US for its American debut in Washington, D. C. for the American Bicentennial. In 1982, he founded the Filarmonica della Scala for the performance of orchestral repertoire by the house orchestra in concert. Abbado remained affiliated with La Scala until 1986. On 7 October 1968, Abbado made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera with Don Carlo. He began to work more extensively with the Vienna Philharmonic (VPO) after 1971, which included two engagements as conductor of the orchestra's New Year's Day concert, in 1988 and 1991. He was a recipient of both the Philharmonic Ring and the Golden Nicolai Medal from the Vienna Philharmonic. He served as Principal Guest Conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) from 1975 to 1979 and became its Principal Conductor in 1979, post he held until 1987 (he was also the LSO's Music Director from 1984 until the end of his principal conductor tenure). From 1982 to 1985, he was principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO). In 1986, Abbado became the Generalmusikdirector (GMD) of the city of Vienna, and in parallel, was music director of the Vienna State Opera from 1986 to 1991. During his tenure as GMD in Vienna, in 1988, he founded the music festival Wien Modern. There he backed numerous contemporary composers including Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, Pierre Boulez, and Luigi Nono. Abbado first conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in December 1966. In the late 1980s it was suspected that he might become music director of the New York Philharmonic. However, after appearances as a guest conductor, in 1989, the Berlin Philharmonic elected him as its chief conductor and artistic director, in succession to Herbert von Karajan. During his Berlin tenure, he oversaw an increased presence in contemporary music in the orchestra's programming. In 1992, he co-founded 'Berlin Encounters', a chamber music festival. In 1994, he became artistic director of the Salzburg Easter Festival. In 1998, he announced his departure from the Berlin Philharmonic after the expiration of his contract in 2002. Prior to his departure, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2000, which led to his cancellation of a number of engagements with the orchestra. Subsequent medical treatment led to the removal of a portion of his digestive system, and he cancelled his conducting activities for 3 months in 2001. In 2004, Abbado returned to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic for the first time since his departure as chief conductor, for concerts of Mahler's Symphony No. 6 recorded live for commercial release. The resulting CD won Best Orchestral Recording and Record of the Year in Gramophone magazine's 2006 awards. The Orchestra Academy of the Berlin Philharmonic established the Claudio Abbado Kompositionspreis (Claudio Abbado Composition Prize) in his honour, which has since been awarded in 2006, 2010 and 2014. In addition to his work with long-established ensembles, Abbado founded a number of new orchestras with younger musicians at their core. These included the European Community Youth Orchestra (later the European Union Youth Orchestra (EUYO)), in 1978, and the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester (GMJO; Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra) in (1988). In both instances, musicians from the respective youth orchestras founded spinoff orchestras, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe (COE) and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, respectively. Abbado worked with both these ensembles regularly as well, and was artistic advisor to the COE, though he did not hold a formal title with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. In turn, the Mahler Chamber Orchestra formed the core of the newest incarnation of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, which Abbado and Michael Haefliger of the Lucerne Festival established in the early 2000s, and which featured musicians from various orchestras with which Abbado had long-standing artistic relationships. Since 2004 Abbado has been musical and artistic director of the Orchestra Mozart, Bologna, Italy, and he served until his death. In addition to his work with the EUYO and the GMJO, Abbado worked with the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar of Venezuela. Abbado helps young musicians to have a good performance environment and creative opportunities. Therefore, he founded the \"Chamber Orchestra of Europe(COE)\" in 1978, and in 1986, the \"Mahler Chamber Orchestra,\" was born with a high standard. In 2003, when he revived the \"Lucerne Festival Orchestra\", the outstanding members of the two youth orchestras became the young force of this orchestra. After Karajan's death in 1989, Abbado stood out from many competitors, including Daniel Barenboim, Lorin Maazel and Riccardo Muti. As a result, he became the fifth conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, which is recognized as the world's number one, and the first Italian conductor of the non-German system. Amongst a wide range of Romantic works which he recorded and performed, Abbado had a particular affinity with the music of Gustav Mahler, whose symphonies he recorded several times. Despite this, he never managed to complete a cycle with a single orchestra: in a mix of studio and concert releases, he recorded Symphonies 1\u20132 and 5\u20137 in Chicago, Symphonies 2\u20134, 9 and the Adagio from 10 in Vienna, Symphonies 1 and 3\u20139 in Berlin, and Symphonies 1\u20137 and 9 in Lucerne. A planned Eighth in Lucerne (the intended culmination of his traversal of the symphonies there) had to be cancelled owing to his ill health. The symphony was finally performed and recorded in 2016 under Riccardo Chailly as a tribute to Abbado. He was also noted for his interpretations of modern works by composers such as Arnold Schoenberg, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Giacomo Manzoni, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, Giovanni Sollima, Roberto Carnevale, Franco Donatoni and George Benjamin. Abbado tended to speak very little in rehearsal, sometimes using the simple request to orchestras to \"Listen\". This was a reflection of his own preference for communication as a conductor via physical gesture and the eyes, and his perception that orchestras did not like conductors who spoke a great deal in rehearsal. Clive Gillinson characterised Abbado's style as follows: \". . . he basically doesn't say anything in rehearsals, and speaks so quietly, because he's so shy, so people can get bored. But it works because everyone knows the performances are so great. I've never known anybody more compelling. He's the most natural conductor in the world. Some conductors need to verbally articulate what they want through words, but Claudio just shows it, just does it. \" In performance, Abbado often conducted from memory, as he himself noted: \". . . it is indispensable to know the score perfectly and be familiar with the life, the works and the entire era of the composer. I feel more secure without a score. Communication with the orchestra is easier. \" Koussevitzky Prize, 1958 Dimitri Mitropoulos Memorial International Competition, 1963 (Won the one-year position as assistant conductor to Leonard Bernstein at the New York Philharmonic. ) Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, 12 July 1984 Mahler Medal, 1985 Grand cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, 1986 Knight Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, 1992 Medal for Meritorious for Culture and Art, 13 January 1997 City of Vienna, Ehrenring [Honor ring], 1994 Ernst von Siemens Music Prize, 1994 Praemium Imperiale, 2003 Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medal, 2003Abbado received honorary doctorates from the universities of Ferrara (1990), Cambridge (1994), Aberdeen (1986) and Havana. On 30 August 2013, Giorgio Napolitano, the President of Italy, appointed Abbado to the Italian Senate as a Senator for life, in honour of his \"outstanding cultural achievements\". Abbado became a member of the Public Education and Cultural Heritage Commission of the Italian Senate on 25 September 2013. Abbado recorded extensively for a variety of labels, including Decca, Deutsche Grammophon, Columbia (later Sony Classical), and EMI. He conducted many opera recordings which received various awards. Among these were the Diapason Award in 1966 and 1967; also in 1967 he received the Grand Prix du Disque. In 1968 he was presented with the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis and also the Dutch Edison Award. In 1973, the Vienna Mozart Society awarded him the Mozart Medal. Abbado received the 1997 Grammy Award in the Best Small Ensemble Performance (with or without conductor) category for \"Hindemith: Kammermusik No. 1 With Finale 1921, Op. 24 No. 1\" and the 2005 Grammy Award in the Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with Orchestra) category for \"Beethoven: Piano Concertos Nos. 2 & 3\" performed by Martha Argerich. In 2012, Abbado was voted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame that April, and in May, he received the conductor prize at the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards.

Abbott retired from advertising in October 1998 at the age of 60 to concentrate on writing his first novel. David Abbott was D&AD President in 1975 and President's Award Winner in 1986. The One Club for Art and Copy inducted Abbott into its Creative Hall of Fame in 2001 three years after he retired. Abbott was the second Briton, after David Ogilvy, to be inducted into the hall of fame. In 2000 David Abbott wrote an open letter to Campaign Magazine in response to the publication awarding FCUK their advertiser of the year accolade. The letter to the publication read: Fcuk me, what a brilliant choice for advertiser of the year. Fcuking great idea to put fcuking four-letter words on fcuking big posters, where every fcuking eight-year-old can see them. What a fcuking cool way to get up the noses of those fcuking parents and teacher tossers who are trying to bring their kids up as fcuking goody-goodies. That\u2019s the way to sell a youth brand, though haven\u2019t I seen it fcuking before on the lav walls? Anyhow, great to see the industry magazine behaving in such a fcuking great way - makes me fcuking nostalgic, it does. In response to this letter Trevor Beattie, the man behind the campaign, hit back at Abbott during the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity accusing him of boring the pants off the audience with a lengthy diatribe. Together with Alfredo Marcantonio and John O'Driscoll, David Abbott authored a book about the history of Volkswagen advertising entitled 'Remember those great Volkswagen ads?', which is comprehensive account of the most influential campaign in the history of advertising. His first novel, The Upright Piano Player, was published in 2010 by MacLehose Press. John Burnham Schwartz the author of Bicycle Days and Reservation Road called Abbott's debut novel 'a wise and moving debut, an accomplished novel of quiet depths and resonant shadows.

Abdur-Razzaq (December 20, 1931 \u2013 November 21, 2014) was an African-American activist and Muslim known for being one of Malcolm X's most trusted associates. Born James Monroe King Warden, he was known as James 67X when he belonged to the Nation of Islam and James Shabazz in the years after he left the organization. James Monroe King Warden was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in the impoverished Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. He attended the Bronx High School of Science, from which he graduated with honors. He enrolled in the City College of New York but transferred to Lincoln University in Chester County, Pennsylvania, after a year. He soon left that school as well to join the Army. Following his discharge, he returned to Lincoln and graduated with honors in English in 1958. He received a master's degree from Columbia University. In 1958, Warden joined the Nation of Islam at Mosque No. 7, on 102 West 116th Street in New York City, under Minister Malcolm X. As was the custom among Nation of Islam members, he abandoned the surname of Warden as a vestige of chattel slavery and became the 67th James in Mosque No. 7. By 1960, he had been promoted to lieutenant in the Fruit of Islam, subordinate to Captain Joseph X. Gravitt (later known as Yusuf Shah). Subsequently, he was appointed circulation manager for New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut of Muhammad Speaks, and answered directly to Malcolm X. After the split between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X formed Muslim Mosque, Inc. and appointed James, then still known as James 67X, secretary of the organization, as well as captain of the men. Based on Malcolm X's instruction, he took the name James Shabazz. Brother James, as he was sometimes referred, was also responsible for the formation of the Organization of Afro-American Unity, a secular organization that Malcolm X had also formed, patterned after Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's Organisation of African Unity, and through which Malcolm X intended to charge the United States with violating the human rights of its chattel slave descendants. Shabazz was a constant and willing aide to Malcolm X, in his capacity as head of Muslim Mosque, Inc. and as head of the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He remained with, and vigorously assisted Malcolm X until the leader's murder on February 21, 1965. Abdur-Razzaq spent the years following Malcolm X's murder raising a family and co-founding Al-Karim School (which would later become Brooklyn's famed Cush Campus Schools) with Ora Abdur-Razzaq. He later moved to Guyana, where he worked as a farmer. Returning to the U. S. in 1988, he earned a nursing degree, and he worked in as a nurse until his retirement in 2004. In his later years, Abdur-Razzaq's work as staff consultant for the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture was invaluable in cataloging rare photographs, letters and accounts of Malcolm X's life and times. Furthermore, his expertise was widely solicited by journalists, authors, film makers and educators. In addition to his contributions to a wide array of published works, such as Bruce Perry's Malcolm X: The Last Speeches, Abdur-Razzaq was featured in several television interviews and films, including Malcolm X: Make It Plain and Gil Noble's Like It Is. The DVD version of Jack Baxter's documentary Brother Minister: The Assassination of Malcolm X includes an \"Exclusive Interview with Abdullah Abdur-Razzaq, Malcolm X's closest associate\". In April 2013, Abdur-Razzaq returned to Lincoln University to speak about his memories and experiences working with Malcolm X.

Mr. Coffee, which was first sold in 1972, soon became the dominant coffeemaker in the United States, reaching sales of approximately $150 million by the late 1970s. Abel's invention, the heating element, brewed a milder coffee than traditional methods, largely replaced the percolator in American homes. Home Furnishings News listed Mr. Coffee as one of the most important household consumer products introduced in the previous seventy-five years in a list published in 2002. Prior to his work on the coffeemaker, he held patents in film developing and aviation. Despite his role in the invention of the Mr. Coffee machine, Abel did not drink coffee. Abel was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 12, 1921, at the family home at 8111 Madison Avenue. to Edmund A. Abel, Sr. , a laborer, and Rose Schoeffel Abel, a homemaker. Abel, who had two older sisters, was his parents' only son. He also had a younger sister. He became a student pilot and an amateur radio operator as a high school student. However, his interest in electrical and mechanical engineering began during his early teens while working for his uncle, Joe Schoeffel, who built homes for a living. Abel graduated from West High School on Franklin Avenue, Cleveland, in 1942. He was drafted into the U. S. Army shortly after his graduation at the height of World War II. Abel constructed early remote-controlled flying drones, which were used as target practice during the war. He was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia, and later landed at Cebu, Philippines, towards the end of the war. He was honorably discharged from the Army in 1945. He returned to Ohio following the war, where he studied aeronautical engineering at the AeroWays using the G. I. Bill. Abel, who held patents in aviation and film developing, worked for Westinghouse earlier in his career. Business partners Samuel Glazer and Vincent Marotta of North American Systems Inc. , which was headquartered in Cleveland, originally conceived the basic idea for a consumer, automatic drip coffeemaker for home. Glazer and Marotta soon hired Abel and another former Westinghouse engineer, Erwin Schulze, to create the machine. Abel developed a new type of coffeemaker which used water heated to a lower temperature than traditional percolators. The new brewer also produced a more mellow, lighter taste than a percolator. The new machine, which was patented by Edmund Abel, came to be called Mr. Coffee. In addition to a less bitter flavor, Abel's heating element for Mr. Coffee could also brew coffee much faster than any, similar machines available at the time. Mr. Coffee could brew one cup of coffee in just 30 seconds and ten cups in just five minutes. Abel's heating element for the coffeemaker was unveiled at the National Housewares Show in Chicago in 1971. It went on sale in 1972 for $39. 99, effectively revolutionizing the home brewing market. Beginning in 1973, sales were bolstered by TV advertising that featured New York Yankees baseball great Joe DiMaggio, who became the face of Mr. Coffee for over 20 years. Abel received very little credit or attribution for his patented heating element for the coffeemaker. Though he held the patent for the heating element for Mr. Coffee, Abel assigned the patent to Mr. Coffee's manufacturer, North American Systems. The co-owner of North American Systems Inc. , Vincent Marotta, often took full credit for the complete conception and design of Mr. Coffee in interviews, which reportedly annoyed Abel. Edmund Abel received very few royalties from his patented invention. Abel died from old age at his home in Rocky River, Ohio, at the age of 92. He credited his long lifespan with a natural diet supplemented with grapefruit seed extract. "}, {"text": "Wistin Abela (19 October 1933 \u2013 20 January 2014) was a Maltese politician.

Abse was born in Cardiff, Wales, to a Jewish family. He was the younger brother of politician and reformer Leo Abse and the eminent psychoanalyst, Wilfred Abse. Unusually for a middle-class Jewish boy, Dannie Abse attended St Illtyd's College, a working-class Catholic school in Splott. Abse studied medicine, first at the University of Wales College of Medicine, and then at Westminster Hospital Medical School and King's College London. Abse was a passionate supporter of Cardiff City football club. He first went to watch them play in 1934 and many of his writings refer to his experiences watching and lifelong love of the team known as \"The Bluebirds\". Although best known as a poet, Abse worked in the medical field, and was a physician in a chest clinic for over thirty years. He received numerous literary awards and fellowships for his writing. In 1989, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Wales. His first volume of poetry, After Every Green Thing, was published in 1949. His autobiographic work, Ash on a Young Man's Sleeve, was published in 1954. He won the Welsh Arts Council Award in both 1971 and 1987, and the Cholmondeley Award in 1985. He was a Fellow of The Royal Society of Literature from 1983. In a foreword to Collected Poems 1948\u20131976, Abse noted that his poems are increasingly \"rooted in actual experience,\" both domestic and professional, and many display a reconciliation between Jewish and Welsh themes and traditions. Abse lived for several decades in the north-west area of London, mainly near Hampstead, where he has considerable ties. For several years he wrote a column for the Hampstead and Highgate Express, the local newspaper. These articles were subsequently published in book form. In 2005, his wife Joan was killed in a car accident, while Abse suffered a broken rib. His poetry collection, Running Late, was published in 2006, and The Presence, a memoir of the year after his wife died, was published in 2007; it won the 2008 Wales Book of the Year award. The book was later dramatised for BBC Radio 4. He was awarded the Roland Mathias prize for Running Late. In 2009, Abse brought out a volume of collected poetry. In the same year, he received the Wilfred Owen Poetry Award. Abse was a judge for the inaugural 2010 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine. Abse was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to poetry and literature.

He was a member of the Fatah political party, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and a senior minister in the Palestinian Authority. He spent years in prison in Israel after being convicted of multiple murders and being sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released in a prisoner exchange deal. He died following an altercation with Israeli soldiers during a Palestinian protest in Turmus Ayya. The circumstances leading to his death are disputed. Abu Ein was a member of Fatah and a senior Palestinian official. Before the outbreak of the first intifada, Abu Ein appeared regularly on Israeli television talk shows to discuss politics and was involved in direct talks with Israeli officials on a project that would result in a strategic solution with Israel in the absence of a Palestinian state. From 2003 to 2012, he served as deputy Minister for Prisoners' Affairs in the Palestinian Authority. In September 2014, he became head of the PLO's Commission Against the Separation Wall and Settlements, responsible for monitoring Israeli activities concerning the separation barrier and construction in settlements in the West Bank and peaceful \"popular resistance\" activities of Palestinians against the security barrier and settlements as well. As of September 2014, he was also Minister of Wall and Settlement Affairs without portfolio in the Palestinian Unity Government of June 2014, involved in coordinating and planning non-violent activities on confiscated land or land designated to be expropriated by the Israeli government. Abu Ein spent more than a decade behind bars over a series of arrests. He first became a prisoner in 1977 in Israel at 18. He was accused of planting a bomb in Tiberias in 1979 which killed two Israeli teenagers and wounded 36 others. He fled to the U. S. where he was arrested at the request of Israel on suspicions that he had planted the bomb. He spent three years in a Chicago prison fighting extradition, but in 1981 became the first Palestinian to be extradited by the US to Israel. In Israel he faced trial and was convicted of multiple murders a year later by an Israeli court. He was sentenced to life in prison. As part of a prisoner exchange deal in 1983 he was released, but immediately re-arrested at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, where he was to be deported to Algeria via Egypt. The International Committee of the Red Cross strongly condemned the action, and the Human Rights Council in Geneva passed a resolution that called for Abu Ein's immediate release, with only the US and Israel opposing. In 1985, he was released as a result of another prisoner deal exchange, the Jibril Agreement, to be arrested for the third time under administrative detention a few months later. After several months, he was rearrested, based on suspicions that he was plotting to hijack a bus. During the second intifada, in 2002, Abu Ein was arrested and subjected to administrative detention. On 10 December 2014, Abu Ein took part in a protest march to plant olive trees outside the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya, near Ramallah. During the march, the group had a confrontation with Israeli soldiers, who had been dispatched to the event. The soldiers fired tear gas and stun grenades at the demonstrators. During the confrontation, Abu Ein exhibited signs of physical distress, first sitting down and holding his chest and later losing consciousness. An Israeli military medic began administering first aid to an unconscious Abu Ein, but, shortly thereafter, the group of Palestinians present decided to evacuate him to a nearby health clinic in Turmus Ayya. He was then transferred by ambulance to a hospital in Ramallah, where he was declared dead upon arrival. Following the incident, differing reports arose from witnesses who had been present and from video of the encounter. There were claims that Abu Ein had been assaulted by Israeli soldiers during the confrontation, including being choked, headbutted by a soldier wearing a helmet, and struck in the chest with a rifle butt. There is video of Abu Ein engaged in a heated altercation with Israeli soldiers, at one point being grabbed around the neck by one. Video from shortly afterward shows Abu Ein sitting down and holding his chest, before falling unconscious and being treated by an Israeli medic. He is then shown being rapidly carried away by Palestinians on the scene. Roy Sharon, an Israeli journalist who was present, stated that Abu Ein was never struck in the chest with a rifle butt. A joint autopsy was conducted with Jordanian, Palestinian, and Israeli doctors. While both sides agreed that Abu Ein died from a blockage of the coronary artery due to hemorrhaging, they disagreed on the underlying cause of death. The Palestinian and Jordanian doctors said wounds to Abu Ein's front teeth and bruises on the tongue, neck and windpipe were indicative of violent acts that led to his death. The Israeli pathologist said that these injuries could have been caused by violence, but that he thought those injuries were \"more compatible with the results of resuscitation efforts. He had 4 children.

The movement is led by the Emir of Bida, Abubakar Yahaya, and is also supported by the Etsu Lapai, Umar Baogo III. In January 2010 Abubakar conferred the honorary title of \"Badakoshin Agaie\" on the Niger State governor Muazu Babangida Aliyu. In July 2010 he was attacked in Agaie by an angry mob who accused him of siding with the police after local people had tried to prevent police from pursuing suspected criminals. In the ensuing violence one person was killed, and later the mob carried his body to the Etsu's palace.

Abubakar spearheaded the creation of Gombe State, one of Nigeria's 36 states, in 1996. He was also the Chairman of the Council of Emirs and Chiefs since 1984. Abubakar was born in the Doma area of Gombe in 1938. He was the fifth son of the 9th Emir of Gombe, Mallam Abubakar Umar. He attended Elementary School and Bauchi Middle School. Abubakar graduated from the Barewa College, Zaria, secondary school in 1966. Abubakar began his professional career at the former Gombe Native Authority as an engineering assistant. He then worked at the Technical Training Centre, Kaduna Institute of Administration. Abubakar also joined the staff of two former northern Nigerian state governments: the former North-Eastern State government and the government of the now-defunct Bauchi State, where he became the Permanent Secretary of Parastatals, Local governments, Animals, Forestry and Establishment. He also served as the permanent secretary and two-time member of the National Universities Commission (NUC). Emir Shehu Abubakar died at Royal Marsden Hospital, Fulham Road, London, where he had been undergoing treatment for cancer, on May 27, 2014, at the age of 76.

Born in the city of Trapani in Sicily, Carla Accardi studied at the Accademia di Bella Arti in Palermo and Florence prior to moving to Rome in 1946. She founded the art group Forma in 1947 with fellow artists Pietro Consagra (1920-2005), Ugo Attardi (1923-2006), Antonio Sanfilippo (1923-1980), Giulio Turcato (1912-1995), Piero Dorazio (1927-2005), Achille Perilli and Mino Guerrini, an Italian screenwriter, director, actor and painter. Accardi married Sanfilippo in 1949. Forma 1 had their first exhibition in Rome in 1947. Accardi's work became well known in France where the art critic Michel Tapie took an interest in her work. Accardi's earliest paintings were self-portraits, but her move to Rome prompted more experimental work. In 1946, she joined the Italian avant-garde movement. In the 1960s, Accardi started making her first paintings in black and white, focusing on monochromy, color, and shapes. She transitioned to vibrant and intense colors in the mid-1960s, with Stella and II Stella (Star I and II). She also began using a clear plastic material called Sicofoil, which she describes as \"like something luminous, a mixing and a fluidity with the surrounding environment: perhaps in order to take away the totemic value of the painting. \" She used this material to make Tendas, or tents of clear plastic, which she adorned with painted forms. During the late 1970s, she became part of the feminist movement with critic Carla Lonzi. Together, they founded Rivolta femminile in 1970, one of Italy's first feminist groups and publishing houses. Accardi is considered a key member of the Italian Avant-Garde and her artwork influenced the Arte Povera movement in the late 1960s. Accardi's first solo exhibition in the United States was in 2001 at MoMA PS1. Known works include: 1960 Bianco nero su turchese (1960), Azzurroviolarancio (1962), Bozetto Bronzo (1964), Segni Rosa and Verde (both 1968), Segni Rosa (1971), Per L'Infinito lo Scirocco (1987), Apparenti Tinte (1990), Grigio Rosso (1992), Verde Rosso (1997), Viola Arancio (2005), Blu (2007), Rosso du Grigio (2008), Senza Titulo (2011), L'Enigma dell'ora, Melodie Fluvial and Mistero en forme (2012).

She served as the former Senior Special Adviser (SSA) to President Olusegun Obasanjo on Arts and Culture, and foundation member of the Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA). Catherine Acholonu was born in Orlu to the family of Chief Lazarus Olumba. She attended secondary schools in Orlu before becoming the first African woman to gain a master's degree (1977) and a PhD (1987) from the University of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. She taught at Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri, commencing 1978. Acholonu was the author of over 16 books, many of which are used in secondary schools and universities in Nigeria, and in African Studies Departments in USA and Europe. Her works and projects enjoyed the collaboration and the support of United States Information Service (USIS), the British Council, the Rockefeller Foundation and in 1989 she was invited to tour educational institutions in USA, lecturing on her works under the United States International Visitor's Program. In 1990 Catherine Acholonu was honoured with the Fulbright Scholar in Residency award by the US government, during which she lectured at four colleges of the Westchester Consortium for International studies, NY, USA. Part of her work took her into the wider sphere of sustainable development. In 1986 she was the only Nigerian, and one of two Africans to participate in the United Nations Expert Group Meeting on \"Women, Population and Sustainable Development: the Road to Rio, Cairo and Beijing\u201d, which was organised jointly by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Division for the Advancement of Women, and the Division for Sustainable Development. This took place in the Dominican Republic, and focused on the mainstreaming of gender into the Plans of Action of the UN world conferences of Rio, Beijing and Cairo. From 1999 to 2002, she was the Special Adviser on Arts and Culture to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a post she resigned from to seek election, along with a number of other writers who felt their inclusion in Nigerian politics would for the good. However, she lost the contest for the Orlu senatorial district seat of Imo State, and drew attention to irregularities and rigging. She was recently appointed African Renaissance Ambassador by the African Renaissance Conference with headquarters in the Republic of Benin, and Nigeria's sole representative at the global Forum of Arts and Culture for the Implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNFAC). Prof Acholonu holds several awards from home and abroad. She was listed in the International Who's Who of World Leadership, USA; the African Women Writers' Who's Who; the Top 500 Women in Nigeria; Who's Who in Nigeria; and the International Authors and Writers Who's Who, published in Cambridge, UK. Acholonu was the Director of the Catherine Acholonu Research Center, Abuja (CARC), which she co-founded with Ambassador (Dr. ) Ajay Prabhakar. The center, based in Abuja, is pioneering research into Africa's pre-history, stone inscriptions, cave art, and linguistic analyses of ancient symbols and communication mediums from the continent. She argues that Nigerian rock-art inscriptions, known as Ikom Monoliths, prove that \"Sub-Saharan African Blacks possessed an organized system of writing before 2000 B. C. \" and that she and her assistants are able to translate these. In her book, They Lived Before Adam: Prehistoric Origins of the Igbo The Never-Been-Ruled, she says that Igbo oral tradition is consistent with scientific research into the origins of humanity. Speaking at the Harlem Book Fair, Acholonu summarised the content of her argument as follows: Our research includes the origin and meanings of symbols used in every religion and sacred literature all over the world. In these, we found that the Hebrew Bible, the Kabbalahs of the Hebrews and the Chinese, the Hindu Vedas and Ramayana, and the recently discovered Egyptian Christian Bible called the Nag Hammadi are of immense importance in revealing lost knowledge. Wherever we looked we found evidence confirming the claims by geneticists who have been conducting mitochondrial DNA research in four leading universities here in the USA that all mankind came from sub-Saharan Africa, that Eve and Adam were black Africans. . . Igbo oral traditions confirm the findings of geneticists, that by 208000BC \u2013 208000 BC \u2013 human evolution was interrupted and Adam, a hybrid, was created through the process of genetic engineering. However, our findings reveal that the creation of Adam was a downward climb on the evolutionary ladder, because he lost his divine essence, he became divided, no longer whole, or wholesome. All over Africa and in ancient Egyptian reports, oral and written traditions maintain that homo erectus people were heavenly beings, and possessed mystical powers such as telepathy, levitation, bi-location, that their words could move rocks and mountains and change the course of rivers. Adam lost all that when his right brain was shut down by those who made him. Acholonu died on 18 March 2014 at the age of 62 from a year-long renal failure. \"Going Home\" \"Spring's Last Drop\" \"Dissidents\" \"Harvest of War\" \"Other Forms of Slaughter\"Collections The Spring's Last Drop, 1985 Nigeria in the Year 1999, 1985 Recite and Learn \u2013 Poems for Junior Primary Schools, 1986 Recite and Learn \u2013 Poems for Senior Primary Schools, 1986 Trial of the Beautiful Ones: a play in one act, Owerri, Nigeria: Totan, 1985 The Deal and Who is the Head of State, Owerri, Nigeria: Totan, 1986 Into the Heart of Biafra: a play in three acts, Owerri, Nigeria: C.

He was an emeritus professor in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University. Acton began his education in the Salem City School system. He left at the end of 9th grade to attend boarding school at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, from which he graduated in 1939. He then attended Princeton University, obtaining his Bachelor of Science degree in 1943, and his Master of Science degree in chemical engineering in 1944. He was drafted into the Army in June 1944, and worked for the U. S. Army at Oak Ridge, at a facility that played a key role in the Manhattan Project, for the remainder of World War II. After the war, he became the second graduate from Carnegie Institute of Technology to earn a Ph. D. in Applied Mathematics. Acton spent three years at the U. S. National Bureau of Standards' Institute for Numerical Analysis at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he worked on a machine called SWAC (Standards Western Automatic Computer), one of the first digital computers. In 1952, he returned to Princeton to teach in the mathematics department, and served as director of the Analytical Research Group. While there, his group worked on military weapons, contributing to systems such as the U-2 spy plane and the Nike anti-aircraft missile. He also became an expert and teacher on the IAS Machine, another of the first computers, which was located at the Institute for Advanced Study. During this time, Acton worked with other important figures in early computing, including Princeton Professor John Tukey, who coined the terms \"software\" and \"bit,\" and Thomas Kurtz, who went on to co-invent the computer language BASIC. Other contemporaries he knew and worked with included Albert W. Tucker, Grace Hopper, Richard Feynman, James H. Wilkinson, Claude Shannon, John Backus, and John Nash. Acton moved to the Department of Electrical Engineering in 1955. In 1963, he made the first of two extended visits to the Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur, India, where he helped establish the school's early computing facilities and courses. He initially stayed for one year, and he returned in 1967 to teach and offer organizational advice. As computing evolved, Princeton's electrical engineering department added \"computer science\" to its name before the Department of Computer Science became its own department in 1985. Acton retired as professor of computer science in 1989. Acton is known for his 1970 book Numerical Methods That Work, which was reissued in 1997 by the Mathematical Association of America. More recently, he published Real Computing Made Real: Preventing Errors in Scientific and Engineering Calculations. Before his death, Acton made several anonymous scholarship donations to students in the Salem City School District in Salem County, NJ. Before he died, he made it clear to friends and confidants that he wanted youth in the Salem area, where he was born and raised, to have access to the educational experiences he enjoyed. The Forman S. Acton Educational Foundation was officially incorporated in October 2014, and it currently provides financial assistance for youth in the greater Salem community.

Acton was born in Rockhampton, Queensland on 15 November 1950 to parents Thomas and Valma Acton. He grew up on his parent's cattle property \"Wilpeena\", north of the township of Dingo, with his four siblings Robert, Elizabeth, Evan and Allen. Acton's first investment was made in 1970 when he established Arana Downs with his brother Robert. For the first several years of owning the property, the brothers lived in a tent with their pet cat. Acton continued to grow his investment portfolio until he established the Acton Land and Cattle Company with his brother Evan, which ultimately incorporated 180,000 head of Santa Gertrudis, Charolais, Angus and Brahman cattle on various properties which totaled an area of 3. 87 million acres. Acton's empire ultimately consisted of the million-acre Millungera Station, north of Julia Creek; Barkly Downs, west of Mount Isa; Moray Downs, west of Clermont; Iffley Station, south-west of Mackay; Croydon Station, north of Rockhampton; Mountain View west of Rockhampton; and the Acton's home property Paradise Lagoons, also west of Rockhampton. The business continued to grow, to become one of the country's largest vertically-integrated farming operations valued at $500 million, fulfilling a demand for both domestic and international export markets and which included distributing its own brand of beef called Acton Super Beef. Acton's company exported approximately 30,000 head of cattle to Asia and the Middle East annually. In 2011, a 26,000-hectare portion of Iffley Station was sold to Macarthur Coal for a reported $38 million. In 2012, the Acton's sold their Moray Downs cattle station to Adani Group, an Indian multinational energy and mining conglomerate. The company bought the property, a third of which sits above a huge coal deposit, and plans to use the cattle station for their proposed Carmichael coal mine. The Actons were believed to have sold the 125,000-hectare property to Adani for $110 million, after having originally purchased the property for $7 million twenty years prior. Acton's brother Evan had the biggest stake in the property, and therefore it was he who decided to sell the property. The decision drew criticism from other graziers who had been actively campaigning against coal and gas companies from buying out prime grazing land. In 2015, Acton Land and Cattle Company sold a controlling interest to Australian Country Choice, which saw the two companies form a new joint venture, a new standalone business called Australian Cattle and Beef Holdings. As part of the deal, Australian Country Choice purchased Barkly Downs and began leasing Millungera Station, Croydon Station, Rugby Run, Iffley Station and Moray Downs for an indefinite period. The two Acton properties near Rockhampton, Paradise Lagoons and Mountain View were not part of the deal. Acton had a strong interest in horse racing as his father had once been an amateur jockey. But although Acton himself was also an amateur jockey for a brief period during his younger years he eventually became physically too large to continue riding racehorses so turned his attention to the sport of campdrafting where he was able to compete. He became a keen promoter and competitor of campdrafting and was credited with helping reinvigorate the sport in Queensland. In 2001, Acton and purchased \"Paradise Lagoons\", twelve kilometres east of the entrance to Rockhampton and set to work establishing a $3 million campdrafting complex on the property. The venue was named the Val & Tom Acton MBE Memorial Complex in honour of Acton's parents. It was officially opened by Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson and Australian Campdraft Association President Ed McCormack on 2 May 2003. The venue is best known for becoming the \"spiritual home\" of campdrafting by hosting the Paradise Lagoons Campdraft, an annual four-day event which is claimed to be Australia's richest campdraft, where successful competitors share in hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money. The Paradise Lagoons Campdraft is also used as a charity fundraiser, benefiting organisations such as the Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service and the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia as well as a number of small local community groups. Aside from campdrafting, the Paradise Lagoons complex is used as a general purpose function centre for events such as weddings, birthdays, corporate meetings and balls such as Rockhampton's annual Black Dog BallActon was president of the Clarke Creek Campdraft Association for ten years before stepping down from the role in the early 2000s. He is also listed on the Australian Campdraft Association Honour Roll. Acton was heavily involved in promoting the triennial Beef Australia exhibition in Rockhampton, and was chairman of the 2000 and 2003 events. He was also deputy chairman of the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame in Longreach. In 2016, the chairman of the Stockman's Hall of Fame paid tribute to Acton and said that his vision enabled the funding and provided the blueprint for Longreach's new $2. 5 million Outback Entertainment Centre. Acton also participated in the annual Global Food Forums held in Melbourne and Sydney, in 2013 and 2014. A 2012 television program called Big Australia, produced by Southern Cross Austereo, which was aired nationally on 7mate, focused on the on-ground and aerial mustering operations on Acton's Millungera cattle station. Acton was also featured in a three-part BBC One series in 2014 called John Bishop's Australia, presented by English comedian John Bishop, which aired after Acton's death. ABC Television's national rural affairs program Landline featured Acton a number of times, as part of various discussions concerning the Australian beef industry. Due to their wealth, Graeme Acton and his brother Evan regularly featured on annual \"rich lists\" such as the BRW Rich 200 and The Sunday Mail Top 150 Rich List. In 2010, the Acton brothers placed at #170 on the BRW Rich 200. They climbed the list the following year to place at #151 in the 2011 BRW Rich 200 list. In 2012, they again ascended up the list to placing at #117. They moved back down the list in 2013 to place at #143. Following Graeme Acton's death in May 2014, his brother Evan Acton solely placed at #176 on that year's list. Acton married Jennifer Beak in 1975, and subsequently had four children \u2013 Tom, Victoria, Hayley and Laura. Acton first met his future wife at a bull sale in Gracemere, Queensland in 1970. They later discovered they had been born in the same hospital just hours apart. Throughout the first couple of years of their courtship, they only managed to see each other several times. They almost became engaged in 1972 when Beak proposed to Acton, only for him to turn down the proposal. However, he later sold one of his rifles to enable him to purchase an engagement ring so he could return the proposal. At the time of his death, they had been married for 39 years. Acton's daughter Tory was a candidate in the 2016 Local Government elections, when she campaigned to represent Division 2 in the Rockhampton Regional Council local government area. Tory Acton was part of a team of candidates that had been assembled by mayoral candidate Michael McMillan. Acton achieved 30. 51% of the vote but was defeated by incumbent Neil Fisher who achieved 43. 26% of the vote. Politically, Graeme Acton seemed to be a conservative and openly supported the Liberal Party of Australia and their leader Tony Abbott. Acton hosted Abbott, who at the time was Federal Opposition Leader, at the Paradise Lagoons Campdraft in 2011 and 2013. Abbott's 2013 visit to Paradise Lagoons coincided with his Federal election campaign for the 2013 Federal Election. Upon Abbott's arrival at the event, Acton introduced him as \"the future Prime Minister of Australia\". Abbott ultimately became Prime Minister soon after the event, succeeding Kevin Rudd. In 2013, Acton openly criticised the Beattie and Bligh Labor Queensland governments, accusing them of being unsympathetic to the agricultural industry and food producers, and claimed that he had \"battled\" with them for twenty years. Acton also lay blame for horse racing in regional Queensland being \"decimated\" at the hands of state Labor governments, which he believed were responsible for the sport \"dying out\" in rural areas. Acton died in Brisbane on 9 May 2014 from severe injuries he sustained on 2 May 2014 when a horse rolled on top of him following a fall while he was competing in the Clarke Creek Autumn Classic Campdraft at Clarke Creek, north of Rockhampton. After originally being airlifted to Rockhampton Hospital in a serious condition, Acton was transferred to the intensive care unit at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital with critical head and spinal injuries. Although there were signs of slight improvement during his time in hospital, which included being taken off life support and breathing on his own, Acton eventually succumbed to his injuries one week after the accident. A number of Australian leaders expressed sadness when they learnt of Acton's death, including Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott, Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce and Premier of Queensland Campbell Newman who all paid tribute to Acton's contribution to the Australian beef industry. Acton's funeral was held at his Paradise Lagoons Campdraft Complex. Following Acton's death, a 1200-metre horse race at a race meeting in Middlemount was named the Graeme Acton Memorial Benchmark 55. A program called Graeme Acton Beef Connections was launched at Rockhampton's triennial Beef Australia exhibition in 2015. The program was developed to mentor and provide training opportunities for young beef producers. It was named in Acton's honour due to his reputation of providing support and mentorship of young people entering the industry. A hand-woven tapestry portrait of Acton was unveiled at the Rockhampton Art Gallery while the Beef Australia exhibition was being held in the city in 2015. Friends of Acton had the portrait commissioned from the Australian Tapestry Workshop. Former Governor of Queensland, Penelope Wensley AC addressed the guests at the unveiling and said that the portrait captured both the spirit of the country and of Acton himself. Rockhampton's Central Queensland University posthumously made Acton an Honorary Doctor of the University in 2015, to recognise his role as an ambassador for the Central Queensland region and for the Australian cattle industry in general. During the 2015 Paradise Lagoons Campdraft, a bronze bust of Graeme Acton at the venue was unveiled by Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

Adadevoh led the team who oversaw the treatment of Patrick Sawyer a Liberian, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in Nigeria. Dr. Adadevoh also kept Patrick Sawyer at the hospital despite receiving a request from a Liberian ambassador to release him from the hospital. Dr. Adadevoh tried to create an isolation area, despite the lack of protective equipment, by creating a wooden barricade outside Patrick Sawyer's door. Her heroic effort saved the nation from widespread infection. As of these events, Nigerian Doctors were on strike, and that could have caused severe crises. The professionalism and thorough medical examination carried out by Dr. Ameyo Adadevoh was impeccable. Adadevoh also provided staff with relevant information about the virus, procured protective gear and quickly contacted relevant officials. As a result of her report, the Nigerian government declared a national public health emergency and the Nigerian Ministry of Health set up an Ebola Emergency Operations Center. WHO declared Nigeria to be Ebola-free on October 20, 2014. Ameyo Adadevoh married Afolabi Emmanuel Cardoso on April 26, 1986. She gave birth to her only son Bankole Cardoso.

Her 2004 album, I'm on the Move, was released by Eastlawn Records. In 2006 she released the EP Detroit's Queen of the Blues, which was named Outstanding Blues/R&B Recording at the 2006 Detroit Music Awards. At age 91 she recorded Detroit Is My Home, with Ann Rabson and Thornetta Davis. Adams was born as Roberta Louise Osborn on July 26, 1917, in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was raised in Detroit by family members, initially an aunt. From an early age she wanted to be an entertainer. Escaping a difficult home life at age fourteen, she began living on her own, getting a small apartment near Woodward, where she stayed for five or six years. She began performing as a tap dancer in Detroit's Hastings Street clubs in Detroit and began singing shortly after. In the 1940s, she appeared at the B&C club as a tap dancer, among artists such as John Lee Hooker. When headliner Kitty Stevenson was too ill to perform one night, Adams gave an impromptu two-song performance, as a result of which the club hired her as a vocalist for a five-year stint. Among her contemporaries and musical teachers on Hastings Street were Hooker, Big Maceo Merriweather, Eddie Burns, and Eddie Kirkland. Phil and Leonard Chess, of Chess Records, heard Adams performing on Hastings Street and signed her as a vocalist in the 1950s. With Chess she recorded with Red Saunders's band, among other artists. Several of her recordings were included on Chess compilations in the 1990s. For a time she was a member of the Bluesettes, a vocal group that toured as part of Tiny Bradshaw's big band.

Spangler was a co-producer. MTV praised the backing band, saying they offered \"tasteful support\" and stating that \"the main attraction here is the forcefully husky-voiced Adams.

Adams (February 3, 1961 \u2013 August 15, 2014) was an American skateboarder who as a teen, was the youngest member of the Zephyr Competition Skateboarding Team (Z-Boys). His spontaneous freestyle skateboarding style, inspired by ocean surfing, helped innovate and popularize modern skateboarding. His aggressive vertical tricks make him one of skateboarding's most influential stylists. Adams died of a heart attack on August 15, 2014. Jay Adams was born in a part of Venice, California. He was the only child of Robert Adams and Philaine Romero, and grew up with his mother and his stepfather, Kent Sherwood. He began skating and surfing at the age of four. Sherwood worked at Dave Sweet's Surf Shop under Pacific Ocean Park, where Adams was introduced to skateboarding. Adams' skateboarding was greatly influenced by Larry Bertlemann, a professional surfer known for dragging his hands along the waves as he rode them. In 1974 at age 13, Adams became the youngest member to join the Santa Monica-based Zephyr surf team, known to locals as Dogtown, representing Jeff Ho Surfboards and Zephyr Productions. Fellow Z-Boy Tony Alva said of Adams, \"Some kids are born and raised on graham crackers and milk; he was born and raised on surfing and skateboarding. \" The Z-Boys became a skate team when they heard about the Bahne-Cadillac Del Mar Nationals in 1975. Adams was the first member to enter the competition, held in Del Mar, California, taking second place in the Junior Men's Freestyle. His explosive energy and low, bold, surf-like moves characterized the style of the Z-Boys and contrasted with the traditional style of the era, which was still based around gymnastic-style tricks formulated in the 1960s. Adams' ability to turn near-disasters into never-before-seen feats of style and agility was termed \"an athletic stream-of-consciousness\" by the 2001 documentary about the team, Dogtown and Z-Boys. Much of Adams' and the rest of the Zephyr team's fame is due to photo-journalist and writer Craig Stecyk's \"Dogtown Chronicles\" in the 1975 relaunch of Skateboarder Magazine. The series of magazine articles chronicled the adventures of the Z-Boys, who rode empty swimming pools in Southern California over a two-year period, laying the foundation for vertical skateboarding. The international reach of Stecyk's Dogtown articles and skateboard-industry sponsorship led to skateboarding becoming a viable profession. By age 15, Adams was one of the first skateboarders shown \"catching air\" (time spent in the air after launching) above the edge of a swimming pool. The Zephyr team broke up shortly after the Del Mar Nationals. Half the team formed a new team under Adams' stepfather Kent Sherwood, who made the Zephyr boards. Sherwood and Adams created the brand and team EZ-RYDER, which changed its name to Z-Flex six months later. Adams was the face of the brand. During his skateboarding career, Adams was sponsored by Hurley, Nixon, Osiris Shoes, Z-Flex, Tracker Trucks, Vercelli Surfboards, Carver Racks, Abec 11 wheels and Black Flys. Along with Jef Hartsel, Adams would go on to revive EZ-RYDER as EZ Ryder Originalz, custom designing and testing their handcrafted equipment. He collaborated with Z-Flex, designing boards in the Z-Flex range, most notably the Z-Flex Jay Adams Cruiser Skateboard. According to former Z-Boys teammate Stacy Peralta, Adams \"is probably not the greatest skater of all time, but I can say without fear of being wrong that he is clearly the archetype of modern-day skateboarding. \"Adams was inducted into the Skateboarding Hall of Fame in 2012. Adams is featured prominently in the 2001 Peralta-directed documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys. Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan noted his contribution to the film: \"Dogtown is at its dramatic best with mini-profiles of its two biggest names, Adams and Tony Alva. The Adams segment especially, which shows the most naturally gifted of the Z-Boys regretful about the bad choices he made in his life, provides the kind of thoughtful introspection this film could have used a lot more of. \" The documentary won awards at Sundance and an Independent Spirit Award. Adams was portrayed by Emile Hirsch in the 2005 dramatized feature-film account of the Z-Boys origins, Lords of Dogtown, written by Peralta and directed by Catherine Hardwicke. He was also featured in Joshua Pomer's 2010 surf documentary The Westsiders. Adams spent time in prisons as he struggled with drug addiction. In 1982, he was convicted of assault following a fight he instigated with a gay couple in Los Angeles which led to the death of Dan Bradbury. Adams served six months in prison for the assault. In the late 1990s, after the murder of his brother, and the death of his mother, father, and grandmother all in the same year, he began using heroin. He was serving two-and-a-half years on drug charges in Hawaii during the production of Dogtown and Z-Boys and was released in 2002. The movie brought Adams back into the limelight and led to endorsement deals for him. As of 2005, Adams was drug-free and spoke to children at local schools about his past struggles. Nonetheless, in November 2005, he was arrested and sentenced to four years, after being caught on a wiretap acting as a go-between for a buyer and seller of crystal methamphetamine. He was released to a halfway house on July 8, 2008 for the remainder of his sentence. He completed his probation in January 2014. Adams' first wife was Alisha Adams, with whom he had a daughter, Venice. He also has a son, Seven, with ex-girlfriend Samantha Baglioni. Adams married Tracy Adams in 2011. They most recently resided in San Clemente, California, where Adams was an active member at a local church. Adams died of a heart attack on August 15, 2014. A memorial funeral service was held in honor of Adams at Venice Beach, California, on August 30, 2014. Surfers and skateboarders from across the country showed their respect by taking part in a traditional Hawaiian-style paddle-out tribute. A memorial skate session was held for Adams at the Venice Beach Skatepark by fellow skateboarders Tony Alva and Christian Hosoi. Two Venice-area murals commemorate Adams. One is on the building site of the original Zephyr Skate Shop in Santa Monica. The other is on the surface of Venice Skatepark's bowl, featuring Adams alongside fellow Dogtown skater, the late Shogo Kubo. DOGTOWN \u2013 The Legend of the Z-Boys, C. R. Stecyk III & Glen E.

Like most established Illustrators at the time Norman Adams considered Robert Fawcett to be: \"The Illustrator's Illustrator. \" When Norman Adams finally met Robert Fawcett, he, Fawcett, was so impressed with Adams' paintings that he considered Norman to be a Babe Ruth of Illustration, perhaps because Norman worked for the \"New York Yankees\" of Illustration at the time: the \"preeminent\" Charles E Cooper Studio. Another more obvious reason Fawcett might have referred to Adams as Cooper's Babe Ruth was his versatility. When Adams was working for Cooper only Don Crowley could paint realistically enough to be versatile. All of Cooper's other illustrators, like Murray Tinkelman, Coby Whitmore, and James Bama were too specialized to be versatile. Not only were they specialized but they were specialized for so long that they would not do jobs outside their \u201cspecialty. \u201d What separated Adams's paintings from others was the \u201ctrompe l'oeil\u201d detail he routinely put into his paintings. It was this extra detail that made his paintings stand out, especially to professions like Cooper and Fawcett. Illustrators took for granted that it was a waste of time to put detail into their originals that would be lost in the published reproduction. Adams also knew this, but what he did not take for granted: although much of the \u201ctrompe l'oeil\u201d detail he put into his originals would be lost in reproduction, it was this detail that would get him new jobs that other illustrators would not get. It was all these additional jobs that made him Cooper's \u201cBabe Ruth. \u201d Adams' illustrations included works for Reader's Digest, Boys' Life, Harpers, National Geographic, TV Guide, Saturday Evening Post, True Magazine, Argosy, Sports Afield, Field and Stream, Business Week, Cabela's, Medical Economics, and other paperback covers. He also authored a textbook now in its 30th Edition, Drawing Animals. When the magazines started to fail the Charles E Cooper Studio had to downscale. This prompted Norman Adams to join an elite group of illustrators at Artists Associates. In 1980 Lenox hired him to do a very limited edition Lenox Collection of 12 unique plates that were released in 1982 called The American Wildlife Plates by Norman Adams. In the mid-1980s, Adams was given an opportunity to paint for the 1988 Minnesota Wildlife Art Show. His work was a life-sized Golden Eagle in a Grand Canyon setting. For years he sold his wildlife and animal paintings in galleries in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Mason Bierce, Adams was born in San Antonio, Texas, but her family moved to California when she was 2. During her high school years, she studied violin and drama, and she was selected to be a concert mistress of the all-city high school orchestra of Los Angeles. She received a full scholarship to Juilliard, which she turned down to spend years studying at the Pasadena Playhouse. After the Playhouse, she got her start on Lux Radio Theatre and then with the Harry Conover Modeling Agency, where she was given her nickname \"Poni\". (This was supposedly due to her love of horses, but in reality it was to provide her with a more memorable stage name. ) (In the book Westerns Women: Interviews with 50 Leading Ladies of Movie and Television Westerns from the 1930s to the 1960s, Adams said: \"I was given that name at the Harry Conover Modeling Agency. Why, I don't know!) She returned to using her real name in 1945. Military personnel played a role in her change of names from Poni Adams to Jane Adams.

She may be best known for her role as Nina in House of Dracula (1945), but she also has the distinction of acting in early adaptations of both major DC Comics franchises: Batman, where she played Vicki Vale in the second Batman serial, Batman and Robin, and also a character in the first Superman television series. On July 27, 1940, Adams married Ensign J. C. H. Smith, a United States Navy pilot, in Norfolk, Virginia. He died in World War II on 15 September 1943 in Hawaii. On July 14, 1945, in Hollywood, California, she married Thomas K. Turnage, a decorated major general with the army. Turnage served in the Korean War and earned the Distinguished Service Medal and Bronze Star. He later served as the last administrator of the Veterans Administration before the VA became a cabinet department during Ronald Reagan's presidential term. Adams and Turnage had two children. On May 21, 2014, Adams died in Bellingham, Washington, at the age of 95. She was buried (as Betty J. Turnage) beside her husband in Arlington National Cemetery.

He played in the Football League with Blackpool and Oldham Athletic. Adams was given a trial by Blackpool in April 1948 while on the books of Oxford City. He was signed for the Tangerines' 1948\u201349 campaign on 29 May, and was marked as being one of Stanley Matthews' understudies. He made his League debut for Blackpool on 25 September 1948 as a deputy for Matthews, who was on international duty, in a single-goal victory over Liverpool at Bloomfield Road. When Billy Wardle was injured later in the season, Adams had a four-game run at outside left and then, when Matthews was injured, at outside right for four games. It was in his first game in the latter position that he scored the only goal of the game in a victory over Portsmouth on 9 April 1949. At the end of his maiden season, he had played nine League games. It wasn't until 7 January, in the following 1948\u201349 season, that Adams returned to the first team as cover for the injured Wardle. He played four League games this season. Due to a lack of first-team opportunities due to the presence of Stanley Matthews, coupled with the signing of Bill Perry, Adams requested a transfer in May 1950. The directors turned down the request. He initially refused the club's terms for the 1950\u201351 season, but eventually re-signed, on the eve of the campaign. He had to wait until 14 April for his next League appearance. He played two other games that campaign, which proved to be his final ones for the club. Adams joined non-League Worcester City in September 1952, before returning to the Football League when he signed for Second Division Oldham Athletic the following June. He went on to play for Northwich Victoria, either side of a spell with Mossley, before retiring in the close season of 1957. Adams became a salesman for the Manchester Evening News, but continued to live on Bloomfield Road, close to the football ground where he made his League debut. Adams was married to Muriel. He had two children, Ken and Mark. Adams died on 14 January 2014, aged 85.

He was best known for his role as Daniel Fogarty in several series of The Onedin Line. Adams was born in Poplar, London and his father was a commercial chauffeur. After school he did national service in the Coldstream Guards, then joined the Unity Theatre, London. He adopted the stage name of Tom Adams and taught English and drama at the Cardinal Griffin secondary modern school, Poplar, in the 1960s between acting jobs with repertory companies. He appeared in television series such as The Avengers, Maigret and Ghost Squad as well as films from 1961 and made his West End debut, supporting Anton Walbrook and Peter Sallis, in Masterpiece at the Royalty in 1961. He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962 as one of an infusion of new actors into Michael Elliott\u2019s production of As You Like It at the Aldwych Theatre. His first big screen break was a role as Nimmo in The Great Escape (1963), in which the salary from the film allowed him to buy his first car. He starred as the lead of a film series featuring a low budget imitation James Bond named Charles Vine in three films beginning with Licensed to Kill (aka The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World, 1965) and the sequels Where the Bullets Fly (1966) and Somebody's Stolen Our Russian Spy (aka \"O.

He was President of Uruguay, as an interim chief executive, between February and March 1985 and between the resignation of Gregorio \u00c1lvarez and accession to office of Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti. Addiego had been president of the Supreme Court since 1984 when the sitting president, General Gregorio \u00c1lvarez, who did not look favourably on the candidacy of the Colorado Party's Sanguinetti and his subsequent election to the presidency in November 1984, opted under pressure to resign in February 1985. By 1985 there had been increasing divisions among members of the National Security Council, which had originally sponsored \u00c1lvarez's appointment to the presidency in 1981. In addition, Sanguinetti and his Colorado Party supporters felt they had strong reasons to seek to discredit \u00c1lvarez in favour of their candidate. For both the (relatively) moderate members of the National Security Council and for Sanguinetti and his supporters, a mutually acceptable transitional figure was sought. Thus it was Addiego who briefly came to serve out the remainder of \u00c1lvarez's expected term of office until President-elect Sanguinetti was sworn in at the beginning of March 1985. Defenders of the political arrangement whereby Addiego became president were able to point out that it enabled Sanguinetti to receive the transfer of office from a civilian (\u00c1lvarez being a General). To international observers, the public relations aspect of what was billed as Uruguay's transition to democracy was enhanced by the increased psychological distance between Sanguinetti and \u00c1lvarez. Sceptics were able to recall that since Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry's 1973 coup, which had led to the increased involvement of the Uruguayan military in the government, various of the so-called 'Military Government' Presidents - Bordaberry, Demicheli and M\u00e9ndez, were in fact civilians, and it had been the military-backed National Security Council in any case which had cooperated with the November 1984 Presidential elections. Furthermore, it is an undoubted fact that many members of Sanguinetti's Colorado party supported rule by decree, both in the preceding 12 years and, indeed, during the extra-parliamentary r\u00e9gime of Gabriel Terra during the 1930s. From whatever perspective, however, the reasons which led to Addiego's brief period of presidential office exemplify something of the nature and even ambiguities underlying the transition to Sanguinetti's presidency. The episode which led to Addiego's taking up of the interim office of the Uruguayan Presidency arguably has historical parallels with the reluctance of US President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower to observe pre-inaugural protocols with the outgoing administration of President Harry S. Truman in 1953, at a time of heightened political and discoursive tension. When he succeeded to the presidency, Addiego had not hitherto held the office of Vice President of Uruguay, since that office had been in abeyance since 1973. It is to be noted, however, that following Addiego's relinquishing of presidential office, the office of Vice President of Uruguay was revived. During the 1973\u20131985 period of civilian-military rule in the later part of which Addiego Bruno participated as president of the Supreme Court and subsequently interim president of the Republic, his overt political affiliation was not apparent. He has subsequently identified himself, however, with the Uruguayan Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica. After relinquishing the interim Presidency in March 1985, he continued to serve as president of the Supreme Court, stepping down in 1993. At Addiego`s death in 2014, his reputation as a former holder of Uruguayan public offices was one which identified him with professedly constitutional processes, even though he had been president of the Supreme Court during a controversial period of civilian-military rule and had not been elected to the office of President of Uruguay which he held on an interim basis during February\u2013March 1985. In this, he resembled several late 19th-century interim presidents, who served as temporary head of state as a result of sometimes complex, bargaining procedures between prominent, political power-brokers.

His father was a native of Ogbomosho, while his mother was a member of the Bachama tribe. He underwent secondary education at the government college, Okene (now known as Abdul Aziz Atta Memorial College, Okene, in present-day Kogi State). He enlisted in the Nigerian Army in 1958 shortly after completing his school certificate examinations. He passed the army selection examinations and thereafter was despatched to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK, the British Army's initial officer entry academy. He was commissioned 2nd Lieutenant on December 15, 1960. As a platoon commander, he served in Kasai Province of Congo with the 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Nigeria Regiment during his first ONUC UN peace keeping tour of duty. In 1962, Lt. Adekunle became Aide-de-Camp to the governor of the eastern region, Sir Akanu Ibiam. The following year, as a Captain, he was posted back to the Congo as Staff Captain (A) to the Nigerian Brigade HQ at Luluabourg - under Brigadier B. Babafemi Ogundipe. In 1964, Major Adekunle attended the Defence Services Staff College at Wellington, in India. When he returned he was briefly appointed Adjutant General at the Army Headquarters in May 1965 to replace Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon, who was proceeding on a course outside the country. However, he later handed over the position to Lt. Col. James Pam and was posted back to his old Battalion (1st Bn) in Enugu as a Company Commander. Adekunle later assumed command of the Lagos Garrison as a substantive Lt. Col. When the Nigerian Civil War erupted in July 1967, Adekunle was tasked to lead elements which included two new battalions (7th and 8th) - to conduct the historic sea borne assault on Bonny in the Bight of Benin on 26 July 1968 (carried out by Major Isaac Adaka Boro's unit). This happened after the federal government gained confidence of most south western ethnic groups as a direct result of Biafran push to mid-west state and probe into Western region. Adekunle was promoted to Colonel after the Bonny landing. The 6th (under Major Jalo) and 8th (under Major Ochefu) battalions of the Lagos Garrison subsequently took part in operations to liberate the Midwest following the Biafran invasion of August 1967. The 7th (under Major Abubakar) stayed behind to hold Bonny. Because Major Jalo's Unit was seconded to Lt. Col. Murtala Mohammed's 2nd Division, Adekunle was left with only the 8th Battalion at Escravos. He, therefore, protested to Army HQ and got the Lagos garrison upgraded to Brigade status through the creation of the 31 and 32 Battalions (under Majors Aliyu and Hamman, respectively). This formation, combined with elements of the Lagos garrison along the eastern seaboard, was officially designated the 3 Infantry Division. However, Colonel Adekunle did not think the name \"3 Infantry Division\" was sensational enough nor did it project the nature of the unique terrain in which his men had to fight. Therefore, without formal approval from Army HQ, he renamed it the \" 3 Marine Commando (3MCDO). \" The \"Black Scorpion\" as he came to be known, was easily the most controversial, celebrated and mythologized figure in the war of attrition that laid the foundations for Nigeria's contemporary crisis; and threw a wedge into the national fabric. Benjamin \"Adekunle's boys in the Midwest seized Escravos, Burutu, Urhonigbe, Owa and Aladima. They captured Bomadi and Patani, Youngtown, Koko, Sapele, Ajagbodudu, Warri, Ughelli, Orerokpe, Umutu and Itagba\". Benjamin Adekunle was promoted to Brigadier in 1972. After the war Adekunle was put in charge of decongesting the Lagos port that was having a chronic problem of clearing imported goods. He held this position until being compulsorily retired on August 20, 1974. He attributed his problems during and after the war to his rivals in the army. In various interviews, he said there was always a rumor of coup linked to him until the army authority felt the concern to do something about it. He had large followings in both the army and public at large and was the most popular military commander during the war, apart from Obasanjo, who succeeded him and brought the war to an end with the same 3MC. Adekunle led the Third Marine Commando Division with such great panache and determination that the foreign media, in looking for a human angle on the Biafran war, found him a ready source of news.

Born in Samara, Adelson-Velsky was originally educated as a pure mathematician. His first paper, with his fellow student and eventual long-term collaborator Alexander Kronrod in 1945, won a prize from the Moscow Mathematical Society. He and Kronrod were the last students of Nikolai Luzin, and he earned his doctorate in 1949 under the supervision of Israel Gelfand. He began working in artificial intelligence and other applied topics in the late 1950s. Along with Evgenii Landis, he invented the AVL tree in 1962. This was the first known balanced binary search tree data structure. Beginning in 1963, Adelson-Velsky headed the development of a computer chess program at the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics in Moscow. His innovations included the first use of bitboards (a now-common method for representing game positions) in computer chess. The program defeated Kotok-McCarthy in the first chess match between computer programs, also in 1966, and it evolved into Kaissa, the first world computer chess champion. In August 1992, Adelson-Velsky moved to Israel, and he resided in Ashdod. Adelson-Velsky died on 26 April 2014, aged 92, in his apartment in Giv'atayim, Israel. Adel'son-Vel'ski\u012d, G.

He was Professor of Fine Arts in the School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania. He was born in Washington, D. C. Adkins was born in Washington, D. C. on May 9, 1953, into a musical household. His father, Robert H. Adkins, a chemistry and science teacher and Korean War veteran, sang and played the organ; his mother, Doris Jackson, a nurse, was an amateur clarinetist and pianist. Adkins' grandfather was the Rev. Andrew Adkins, pastor of the historic Albert Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia. His aunt Alexandra Alexander was a mathematician and NSA code breaker. His uncle Dr. Rutherford Adkins, a former Tuskegee Airman with the 100th Fighter Squadron of the 332nd Fighter Group, flew 14 combat missions and eventually became Fisk University's 11th president. As a young man, Adkins planned to be a musician, but in college he found himself drawn increasingly to visual art. Mentored by Aaron Douglas and Martin Puryear, he earned a B. S. in printmaking from Fisk University in Nashville, followed by an M. S. in the field from Illinois State University and an M. F. A. in sculpture from the University of Kentucky. Adkins was an interdisciplinary artist whose practice included sculpture, performance, video, and photography. His artworks were often inspired by, dedicated to, or referred to musicians or musical instruments; specific installations and exhibitions were sometimes labeled \"recitals. \" Sometimes, these arrangements of sculptures were \"activated\" in performances by Adkins' collaborative performance group, the Lone Wolf Recital Corps. He led the Lone Wolf Recital Corps that premiering works at ICA London, Rote Fabrik, Zurich, New World Symphony, Miami, P. S. 1 MOMA, and ICA Philadelphia. Many of his works draw from the biographies of little known historical figures; his 2011 exhibition Nutjuitok (Polar Star) is based on the life of a black Arctic explorer named Matthew Henson who reached the North Pole with Robert Peary at the turn of the 20th century. In other cases, Adkins' works focus on obscure details in the lives of seminal figures such as the African American writer, activist and sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois, whose famous speech \"Socialism and the American Negro\" (1960) is invoked in the 2003\u20132008 installation Darkwater Record. Adkins' work has been exhibited at museums and galleries worldwide, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, and is in the collections of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; the Studio Museum in Harlem; the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York; and the Tate Modern in London. In 2012 he had a major retrospective at the Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N. Y. His work was also featured at P. S. 1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1) in Queens, the LedisFlam Gallery in Brooklyn and elsewhere. Adkins had work in many exhibitions over the years. Early on, Adkins's art went international with work featured at Project Binz 39 in Zurich in 1986, and at Salama-Caro Gallery in London in 1987. In 1995 Adkins showed work at the Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris in New York, and in 1997 at the International Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D. C. Adkins also had a show in 1999 at the Institute of Contemporary Art at University of Pennsylvania. In 2006 his work \"Darkwater\", a celebration of W. E. B. Dubois, was featured at Gallery 51 at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) in the Berkshires. A short time later, Adkins was included in the 2008 NeoHooDoo: Art for a Forgotten Faith exhibition at MoMA PS1 in New York, which explored ritual and spirituality in art and was organized in collaboration with Houston's Menil Collection. Adkins went international again in 2009, displaying work in Gallery of the American Academy at American Academy in Rome, Italy. In 2012 The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery (tang) at Skidmore College in New York hosted a retrospective of Adkins's work in a show called \"Recital\", including sculpture, video, and photography that honors a number of iconic historical figures and the lesser-known parts of their personal histories. The following year Adkins was featured in the 2013 exhibition Radical Presence: Black Performance in Contemporary Art at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. His art was also included in the 2014 Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum in New York City, the same year his solo show \"Nenuphar\" opened at Salon 94 gallery. Next, at the 2015 Venice Biennale, a sculpture he created from found musical instruments was included in All The World's Futures, an exhibition curated by Okwui Enwezor that centered on social practice in art. The art exhibition \"Nenuphar,\" features various sculptures and mixed media artworks by Terry Adkins, held at the Salon 94 gallery, located in New York City, in 2014. This art exhibition was to showcase similarities between two very different men: Yves Klein, the French Nouveau R\u00e9aliste, and the American George Washington Carver, who was born a slave but went on to become a renowned agricultural chemist, inventor and educator, he also became a musician, painter and creator of dyes and pigments. This exhibition shows how Adkins's extensive historical research revealed loose connections related to botany, music and the nautical, but more importantly his linking of the two men resulted in some arresting works that sparked a satisfy-ing frisson (Ruble, 2014: 154\u2013155). This subject matter of Adkins work helps us understand more of the thought process into his work. \"Meteor Stream\" is an exhibition of work by Terry Adkins at the American Academy in Rome. The show as the culmination of a ten-year cycle on 19th abolitionist folk hero John Brown. In each of various locations across the United States connected with Brown's life, Adkins collaborated with members of the local community and merged newly discovered objects into the installations. The show amounted to a multilayers testimonial that compressed time and integrated historical events and otherworldly meanings. 2009 Rome Prize 2008 USA Fellows Adkins died of heart failure in Brooklyn, New York, in February 2014; he was 60 years old. He was married to Merele Williams (Adkins) and had a son, Titus Hamilton Adkins, and a daughter, Turiya Hamlet Adkins.

Her grandfather, Alfred Adler, was a noted Austrian Jewish psychotherapist, collaborator with Sigmund Freud and the founder of the school of individual psychology. Adler received a bachelor of arts in political science from the University of California, Berkeley and a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York in 1970.

After returning to New York City, she worked at its sister station, WBAI-FM, where, in 1972, she created the talk show Hour of the Wolf (still on the air as hosted by Jim Freund), and later another talk show, called Unstuck in Time. Adler joined NPR in 1979 as a general assignment reporter, after spending a year as an NPR freelance reporter covering New York City, and subsequently worked on a great many pieces dealing with subjects as diverse as the death penalty, the right to die movement, the response to the war in Kosovo, computer gaming, the drug ecstasy, geek culture, children and technology and Pok\u00e9mon.

For many years it was the only introductory work about American Neopagan communities. Her second book, Heretic's Heart: A Journey Through Spirit and Revolution, was published by Beacon Press in 1997. Adler was a Wiccan priestess, an elder in the Covenant of the Goddess, and she also participated in the Unitarian Universalist faith community.

Adnet originally intended a professional career as a pianist. She gradually gave up the piano to devote herself to the drawing and the painting which she had always practised since her childhood. In 50 years of creation Fran\u00e7oise Adnet took part in many exhibitions throughout the world and obtained the highest rewards. Her works are in various museums and private collections and follow two main themes: female figures and cityscapes. Her figurative works are considered her best work, exhibiting a distinctive technique. Adnet was married to Max Fourny, the art collector and gallerist. A museum of naive art is now housed in their former home. Adnet was born in the Montmartre neighborhood of Paris, France on June 30, 1924 to parents Jacques and Luce Adnet. Her father, Jacques Adnet, was a renowned decorator and designer. She began playing the piano at the age of 4, also discovering her talent for painting at the age of 5. Adnet attended music classes under the tutelage of professors Marguerite Long and Alfred Cortot and later attended the Conservatoire de Paris to continue her study under Marcel Ciampi. Adnet was encouraged by her mother to continue her practice, especially during the family's annual trips to Vezelay. It was said by Adnet's father that she did not know the meaning of the expression \"Do Nothing. \" She gave her first piano recital at the age of 12. Through her years of practice, Adnet became an internationally-renowned concert pianist. From 1946 to 1951, Adnet traveled Europe to perform, often to Germany. In 1948 she was asked by the French government to join a cultural tour to entertain the occupying troops present in the city. Adnet was known for her versatility in performing works of Chopin, Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, Schubert, and Mozart. Despite such a successful career in performance, Adnet decided to transition to a career of painting. In 1951 she became a full-time painter. Adnet was self-taught, and over her 70-year career was able to produce more than 3,500 works. She was well known for her talents in drawing and painting, and in 1981 she received the First Eural Prize for drawing in Brussels. She was heavily influenced, like Bernard Buffet and Jean Jansem, by her friend Francis Gruber. She was identified with figurative reaction\u2013opposed to abstraction\u2013and was part of the \"mis\u00e9rabiliste\" movement, which included Buffet, Jansem, and Michel de Gallard among others. Adnet met her future husband, Max Fourny, who was an art publisher, through her work. Fourny was 20 years older, and so the marriage was not condoned by Adnet's parents. However, the two were married on October 8, 1951. Adnet's style is known as post-war figurative art. Common subjects of her paintings were animals, flowers, and the landscapes of Paris. Adnet would often bring back objects from her extensive travels that she found interesting enough to paint. She had a workshop where she would paint for hours daily. Adnet described her artistic process as \"a long exercise of observation, patience, composition, implementation and harmonization. \" The work reminded her of her efforts to perfect her skills at piano, and she often incorporated the same techniques, stating her artwork had \"harmony, rigor, consonances and dissonances. \" Most of her works were oil paintings, with a minority of them being drawings. She is also known for completing nudes and still lifes. Of her painting, Adnet was known to favor portraits, most of which were of female subjects. Adnet once said, \"Every portrait is my self-portrait . . . I project myself into every character I paint. \" Her characters were often dark or brooding, or in distress. Even in her nudes, Adnet intended not to show beauty of nakedness, but to show tragedy in her painted figures. Her drawings were often of children or animals. A common theme is that of a caged bird.

He was considered one of the network's top negotiators, often heading complicated negotiations between NBC and producers, actors and television studios. Agoglia was instrumental in the decision to replace Johnny Carson, the departing host of The Tonight Show, with Jay Leno in 1992. Agoglia was born in Brooklyn, New York. His career began at Barclays Bank, before switching to the television industry. He worked as an executive at CBS for sixteen years before joining rival NBC in 1980. Agoglia moved to southern California permanently when he took the position at NBC. Agoglia worked directly under a string of well-known Presidents of NBC Entertainment and other executives, including Brandon Tartikoff, Warren Littlefield and Don Ohlmeyer. He earned a reputation as one of the network's toughest dealmakers. Agoglia led the often drawn-out negotiations with outside television studios and on-air talent. For example, Agoglia hammered out a deal with Paramount Studios for the renewal of Cheers. He also negotiated the agreement to retain three cast members of Seinfeld - Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards - when each actor was demanding one million dollars per episode at the peak of the show's popularity. Agoglia played a significant role in the decision by NBC to name Jay Leno as the host of The Tonight Show over David Letterman in 1992. The move sparked controversy, as Letterman jumped to CBS after Leno's appointment. Agoglia's role in choosing Leno as Johnny Carson's successor was noted in the 1994 book, The Late Shift, by New York Times journalist, Bill Carter. An HBO film adaptation of the book, The Late Shift, aired in 1996. Agoglia was portrayed by actor Reni Santoni in the film. Agoglia led a multi-network 1993 boycott of the Emmy Awards, following a decision by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to air the awards exclusively on ABC. The Emmys had previously broadcast on the television networks on a rotating basis. Agoglia denounced the exclusivity agreement between ABC and the Emmys as \"bizarre at best\" and retaliated by boycott all Academy events, including the Primetime Emmy Awards. The Academy and the Emmys, under pressure from Agoglia's boycott, eventually relented and cancelled the deal with ABC. The Emmys returned to the previous agreement, in which the award show was broadcast on each of the four broadcast networks on a rotating basic each year. Agoglia rejoined the executive committee of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in 1994 after the deal with ABC was ended. On June 17, 1997, Agoglia announced his decision to retire from NBC. He left NBC in 1998 after eighteen years with the network.

Jack Ag\u00fceros was born September 2, 1934, in New York City, and grew up in East Harlem. His parents, Carmen Diaz and Joaquin Ag\u00fceros, had immigrated separately from Puerto Rico to New York. Carmen worked for many years as a seamstress, while Joaquin was in the merchant marine and also worked in restaurants and factories. Ag\u00fceros attended Public School 72 (now the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center) and then Benjamin Franklin High School, East Harlem's first public high school, from which he graduated in June 1952. After serving for four years in the United States Air Force as a guided missile instructor, he attended Brooklyn College on the G. I. Bill, intending to become an engineer. Inspired by Bernard Grebanier, a charismatic professor of English, and his lectures on Shakespeare, Ag\u00fceros began writing plays and poems, and instead graduated with a B. A. in English literature and a minor in speech and theatre. During the 1960s, Ag\u00fceros worked with a variety of community groups in New York. Starting out at the Henry Street Settlement, he moved on to the Office of Economic Opportunity, a federal agency created by President Lyndon Johnson to fight the War on Poverty, before becoming the deputy director of the Puerto Rican Community Development Project (PRCDP), the nation's first Puerto Rican anti-poverty organization. After resigning from the PRCDP in early 1968, Ag\u00fceros was appointed in April as deputy commissioner of New York City's Community Development Agency (CDA), created by Mayor John Lindsay. As deputy commissioner of the CDA, he was the highest ranking Puerto Rican in the City's administration, and in 1968 staged a five-day hunger strike to protest the lack of Puerto Ricans in City government. Ag\u00fceros went on to be a member of the first cohort of National Urban Fellows, working as an advisor to the mayor of Cleveland and earning a M. A. in Urban Studies from Occidental College. He returned to New York and in 1970, became director of Mobilization For Youth, an organization located in the Lower East Side that provided job training and placement, social services, and special educational programming. Jack Ag\u00fceros wrote his first poems and plays while still a student at Brooklyn College, receiving his first literary awards there. He continued to write while working as a community activist in the 1960s and early 1970s. Among the highlights from this period are the script for \"They Can't Even Read Spanish,\" a half-hour play about Puerto Rican life in New York that aired on WNBC TV Channel 4 on Saturday, May 8, 1971. The script is now preserved at the Centro de Estudios Puertorrique\u00f1os at Hunter College. Ag\u00fceros also wrote a script for Sesame Street, \"No Matter What Your Language\". The song by that name first appeared on the show in its third season (1971\u20131972). In the song, which has since been featured in a number of episodes, a Spanish speaker teaches an English speaker that, if they take the time, anyone can learn a new language. Ag\u00fceros was a member of the National Board for Bilingual Programming for Sesame Street, which received a portion of the show's budget to produce Spanish-language content, and was quoted at the time as being dissatisfied with the show's attempts at bilingualism. Ag\u00fceros's essay \"Halfway to Dick and Jane\", about his childhood in East Harlem, was included in The Immigrant Experience: The Anguish of Becoming American, a collection published in 1971 by the Dial Press that also featured contributions from Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz and Mario Puzo. In his New York Times review of The Immigrant Experience, Gay Talese praised Ag\u00fceros's contribution, writing \"In this book is the first published work of Jack Agueros [sic], impressively describing Puerto Rican homelife in East Harlem. \"Ag\u00fceros maintained an active interest in theatre, reviewing several plays for the Village Voice. (He has also written for El Diario-La Prensa, Soho News, and New York Newsday. ) Two of Ag\u00fceros's poems were included in one of the first anthologies of Puerto Rican literature, Borinquen, edited by Maria Teresa Babin and Stan Steiner, which was published by Knopf in December 1974. The two poems, \"Canci\u00f3n del Tecato\" and \"El Apat\u00e9tico\", are both in Spanish and appear in the section \"Where am I at? The Youth,\" which also includes Pedro Pietri's well-known poem \"Puerto Rican Obituary\". Both poems had originally been published in a literary journal, The Rican (based in Chicago, Illinois) in 1971, and both were later included in Ag\u00fceros's first book, Correspondence Between the Stonehaulers. Ag\u00fceros also published two children's stories in Nuestro, the first national Latino magazine, which was launched in 1977. The first, \"The Magic Maraca\", appeared in English and in Spanish in the December 1977 issue and was illustrated by Ag\u00fceros's one-time neighbour and friend, the artist Robert Zakanitch. The second, \"Cheo Y Los Reyes Magos\" (\"Cheo and the Three Kings\"), written in English, was included in the December 1978 issue. His children's story written around the same time, Kari & the Ice Cream Cone, was later turned into a play co-written with David Smith, and produced at Monroe Community College Theatre in Rochester, NY, and at Eastern Connecticut State University Theatre, Willimantic, CT, in 1988 and 1994 respectively. On June 10, 1975, the Friends of Puerto Rico, a non-profit organization founded and incorporated in 1956, opened the Cayman Gallery in a SoHo loft at 381 West Broadway, with Jack Ag\u00fceros as its first director. The Cayman Gallery was one of the first galleries dedicated to Puerto Rican and Latin American art in New York City. In July 1977, Ag\u00fceros was appointed director of El Museo del Barrio by the Museo's Board of Trustees. That fall, he negotiated with Boys Harbor, a non-profit youth services agency, to relocate El Museo from its home on Third Avenue to its present location: the main floor of the Heckscher Building, a multi-tenant, city-owned property at 1230 Fifth Avenue, between 104th and 105th Streets. In January 1978, Ag\u00fceros began El Museo's tradition of organizing a Three Kings Day Parade to celebrate the Epiphany. The Parade, held annually on January 6, includes live animals (including camels), school groups, and props and costumes, such as paper-mache figures of the Three Kings, made by artists. During his tenure, Ag\u00fceros implemented a series of capital improvements and gallery expansions, and helped build El Museo's permanent collection. In 1979, he co-founded the annual Museum Mile Festival on Fifth Avenue with ten major institutions, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of the City of New York, and The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. He also articulated the evolution of El Museo to an institution with a pan-Latin American mission, telling an interviewer in 1978: \"Our focus is no longer limited to Puerto Ricans. We are too culturally rich to force ourselves into ghettoes of narrow nationalism. El Museo now wants to embody the culture of all of Latin America. New York is the fourth or fifth largest Spanish speaking city in the world, with people from every Spanish speaking country, and El Museo must reflect everything that is Latino. We must look upon Latin America as our Indian ancestors did. They did not see artificial boundaries dividing nations. They saw an open world where they were free to travel from one place to another, pursuing their livelihood and mixing their culture. \"Ag\u00fceros served as director of El Museo until March 14, 1986. After leaving the Museo, Ag\u00fceros's poems and short stories began to appear more regularly in literary magazines. For example, his poem \"Sonnet After Columbus II\" appeared in The Portable Lower East Side (Volume Six, Number One) in 1989 and he was a regular contributor to Hanging Loose, a magazine published three times a year by Hanging Loose Press. Two of his sonnets, \"For Maddog\" and \"For Willie Classen\", appeared in Hanging Loose 55, while \"Sonnet For The Bicycle Rider's Leg\", \"Sonnet: The History Of Puerto Rico\", and \"Sonnet For Alejandro Roman, Remarkable Rider\" all appeared in issue 64. The poems for Maddog and for Willie Classen are typical of Ag\u00fceros's use of a classical form to pay tribute to unusual poetic subjects: in the case of Maddog, a 19-year-old with (already) a long criminal record, and in the case of Classen, a boxer who died a few days after a fight at Madison Square Garden in November 1979. His poems also occasionally appeared in national magazines: for example, \"Sonnet on the Location of Hell\" was published in the April 1996 issue of the Progressive. In 1991, Ag\u00fceros's first collection of poems, Correspondence Between Stonehaulers, was published by Hanging Loose Press. This was followed by Sonnets from the Puerto Rican (a play on Elizabeth Barrett Browning's famous Sonnets from the Portuguese) and Lord, Is This a Psalm?, which were also published by Hanging Loose in 1996 and 2002 respectively. In 1996, Curbstone Press published Ag\u00fceros's Song of the Simple Truth: The Complete Poems of Julia de Burgos, the first book to collect all of the poems by the woman widely considered to be Puerto Rico's greatest poet and to present them in both Spanish and English. In his introduction to the book, Ag\u00fceros recounts seeing de Burgos twice on the streets of East Harlem in the 1950s and having a hard time believing that she was Puerto Rico's most famous poet, as one of his friends told him. He then mostly forgot about her until years later, as an adjunct professor at Touro College teaching English as a second language and public speaking, \"[o]ne day I asked if they [his students, mostly Puerto Rican women] had ever heard of Julia de Burgos and to my surprise nearly every student had. Moreover, they repeated the 'Puerto Rico's greatest poet' line. I decided to find some poems by Julia de Burgos and translate them into English for my students to recite. Ever since I have been in her custody. \"Dominoes and Other Stories from the Puerto Rican, a collection of short stories, was published by Curbstone Press in 1993. Later short stories appeared individually, including \"i always wanted to be an old man\" in Hanging Loose 72 (Hanging Loose Press) in 1998 and \"He is Shorter. . . A Story\" in Prosodia (published by the New College of California, San Francisco) in 1999. An autobiographical essay on Ag\u00fceros's love of bread, \"Beyond the Crust\", appeared in Daily Fare: Essays from the Multicultural Experience, an anthology that appeared in 1993. \"Johnny United\", a story centered on a stickball game in East Harlem, was included in Growing Up Puerto Rican, another anthology published in 1997 that also featured contributions from Abraham Rodriguez, Piri Thomas, Edwin Torres, and Ed Vega among others. In parallel, Ag\u00fceros wrote plays, several of which ran off Broadway. Awoke One was produced at the Ensemble Studio Theatre in 1992; The Sea of Chairs was produced by the Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble in 1993; and Love Thy Neighbor was produced at HERE Theatre in 1994. Dream Star Caf\u00e9 ran at Theater for the New City from January 31 to February 24, 2002. He also translated plays; for example, his English translation of Alberto Adellach's Sabina and Lucrecia was performed by the Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre in spring 1991. In 1973, Ag\u00fceros won a Council on Interracial Books for Children (CIBC) literary award in what was the CIBC's fifth annual contest. Founded in 1965, one of the CIBC's goals was to promote a literature for children that better reflects the realities of a multicultural society. Ag\u00fceros's play The News from Puerto Rico won the McDonald's Latino Dramatist Competition in 1989. In April 2012, Ag\u00fceros was the recipient of the Asan World Prize for Poetry. In summer 2012, Ag\u00fceros's papers were donated to Columbia University, where they are housed in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Ag\u00fceros married three times and had three children and four grandchildren. Ag\u00fceros was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in December 2004. He died on May 4, 2014, from complications related to Alzheimer's. His brain was donated to the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain at Columbia University Medical Center.

Ahlenfelder is best remembered for the game between SV Werder Bremen and Hannover 96 in the 1975\u201376 Bundesliga season when he called half-time after 32 minutes instead of the regulation 45. After complaints by the players Ahlenfelder questioned his assistant who confirmed that it was indeed too early to call half time. He continued the first half but still stopped it a minute early. Later questioning revealed that Ahlenfelder had been drinking during his lunch before the game and felt a little confused. He received a short ban from officiating Bundesliga games but was soon allowed back as a referee. Ahlenfelder was popular with Bundesliga players because of his direct nature. When told by former German international Paul Breitner that he is \"refereeing like an asshole\" Ahlenfelder replied to Breitner \"could it be that you are playing like an asshole?\". When players took longer than he desired to get up after being fouled Ahlenfelder would tell them \"get up, the under-soil heating isn't switched on anyway\".

Salahuddin Ahmed (24 September 1924 \u2013 19 October 2014) was a Bangladeshi historian, humanist and rationalist thinker. Ahmed was born in Motihari, Bihar. He came from an educated Bengali Muslim family. His father Abu Ahmed Faizul Mohi, paternal grandfather Moulvi Ahmed, one of the early Bengali Muslim high-ranking administrators in British India, and maternal grandfather Azizul Haque, (who is credited with having a major contribution to the development of Henry Classification System of fingerprint method) were all students of Presidency College, Calcutta. He received his I. A. from Surendranath College, (formerly Ripon College), and B. A. (Hons. ) in history from Presidency College (now Presidency University). He completed his first M. A. in history from Calcutta University, and then a second M. A. in history from University of Pennsylvania, and his Ph. D. in history from the School of Oriental and African Studies at University of London (1961). Ahmed started his teaching career in 1948 as a lecturer at Jagannath College, Dhaka. Later, he was a lecturer, reader, and then professor of history at Rajshahi University. He was also a professor of history at Jahangir Nagar University and Dhaka University, the job from which he retired in 1984. In 1963, Ahmed was invited by the American Historical Association as a visiting lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago. He was also UNESCO Cultural Fellow at Kyoto University, Japan in 1956. Ahmed was also associated with Independent University, Bangladesh as Professor of National Culture and Heritage, and served as the president of the National Association of Social Sciences of Bangladesh, and chairman of the United Nations Association of Bangladesh. Ahmed was married to Hamida Khanom, who was one of the very few early Muslim graduates (I. A. and B. A. ) from Bethune College, Calcutta. She completed her M. A. from Calcutta University, and then a second B. A. (Hons. ) from University College London. She retired as Principal of Home Economics College, Dhaka. Hamida provided support and inspiration to Ahmed in his professional career throughout their long 60 years of married life. The following quote from the review of one of Ahmed's book: Perspectives on History, Society and Politics published by Readers Service, Kolkata, 2001, aptly captures his views and reputation This is a compilation of articles written over last two decades by a renowned historian of Bangladesh, Professor A. F. Salahuddin Ahmed on topics relating to history, society, and politics of the Indo-Pakistan-Bangladesh subcontinent, which is now known as South Asia. The main contention of the author is this that despite political divisions which took place in 1947 the people of this vast region belong to \"one indivisible civilization which is the product of over thousand years of historical development. \" It was due to the machinations of \"certain vested interests, both indigenous and foreign\" the common people had to pass through untold misery and suffering: and, these 'vested interests, even threatened their 'civilized existence. Professor Ahmed is of the opinion that the destinies of the common people inhabiting this sub-continent 'are closely interlinked'. \"They must\", therefore, \"learn to live together in peace which is essential for their development and progress. \" He made sincere efforts through these articles to promote greater awareness about the problems raised and to provoke \"new thoughts concerning peace and understanding among the people of the three countries. In 2012, Ahmed contributed a chapter, entitled \"Bangladesh, Present, and Future Prospects\" in a memorial book in honor of his younger deceased brother, Fakhruddin Ahmed, a career diplomat,and twice Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh, titled, Regional Cooperation and Globalization: Bangladesh, South Asia and Beyond edited by Dr. Zillur Rahman Khan and Dr. Meghna Guha Thakurta, where he makes a case for appreciating historical perspectives of social and political events: The present state of Bangladesh has to be viewed in the light of the past because, as has been said, the present \"is the child of the past and parent of the future. \" In order to understand the problems and predicaments which confront the country at the present moment we have to turn back to the past. Without understanding the past we cannot understand the present. If we look at history we would find that during the past hundred years or so phenomenal changes have taken place in what may be called the psyche of the Muslims who form the great majority of population of the region. These changes have to be explained and analysed in historical perspective. In 2004, Ahmed in collaboration with Bazlul Momin Choudhury, published a comprehensive editorial volume on the history of Bangladesh, entitled Bangladesh:National Culture and Heritage: An Introductory Reader, which gives an overview of the land, society, culture and religions, and history of the peoples of Bangladesh. Some other notable books in English and Bengali written by Ahmed are: Social ideas and social change in Bengal 1818-18-35 Bangladesh Tradition and Transformation,Bengali Nationalism and the Emergence of Bangladesh Itihash O oitijjo Bangalir Sadhana O Bhangalir Muktijuddha Bangladesh Jatiyabad, Swadhinata, GonotantroHe has also contributed many articles in professional journals. Ahmed's interest and involvement in social service is reflected by his work for the Red Cross during the turbulent period of Partition of India, and his association with the Radical Democratic Party founded by M. N. Roy, and his active involvement in Ahmed Memorial Foundation established by family members dedicated to the educational and social welfare of their ancestral village of Bashbaria in Faridpur, Bangladesh. He maintained an active life until the day he died, serving as the National Professor, writing and publishing articles, giving media interviews. He maintained worldwide contacts with his students, and professional acquaintances, as well as with their children and grandchildren, as many of them continued to seek him out for advise and support, as did his own family, and his house served as intellectual, social, and family gathering place during his lifetime.

Born in Kolkata, West Bengal, he migrated to Dhaka, East Bengal during the Partition period and started his singing career. He is known as East Pakistan's Ahmed Rushdi because his singing style is inspired by Ahmed Rushdi. He was awarded Ekushey Padak in 2005 by the Government of Bangladesh and Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for his performance in the film Kokhono Megh Kokhono Bristi (2003). Bashir Ahmed was born in Calcutta in 1939. He was accepted as a pupil by Ustad Vilayat Hussain at the age of 15. Later, he came to Bombay, and became a student of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. Ahmed performed along with Geeta Dutt. Around the 1960s, when the film producer and owner of Gulistan Cinema Hall, Dossani invited Talat Mahmood and Ahmed to East Pakistan to perform, after their tour of Chittagong and Mymensingh, Mahmood returned to India but Ahmed decided to stay back. In Dhaka, his mentor and brother-in-law, Ishrat Kalkatvi introduced him to Robin Ghosh. Kalkatvi was writing songs for the film Talash (1963), although eventually, Suroor Barabankvi contributed more songs to the film. Ghosh was making tunes for the film. Ahmed sang some numbers for Talash, including the soft romantic one, titled \"Kuch Apni Kahiye Kuch Meri Suniye, Yeh Sham Yeh Tanhai Yun Chup To Na Rahiye\". Ahmed sang another song titlted Main Rickshawalla Matwala. He had another duet in the film, \"Tum Bhi Haseen Dil Bhi Jawan\". Ahmed was also a poet and a lyricist, with a pseudonym B. A. Deep. Film-maker, Mustafiz, they contacted Bashir and asked him to write a song for his film, Saagar (1965 film), which he did, titled Ja dekha pyar tera, and sang it too. Similarly in Robin Ghosh's another lilting offering, Karwan, in 1964, Bashir wrote and sang Jab tum akele hoge hum yaad aayenge. He wrote film songs, as B. A. Deep, and also continued to sing as Bashir Ahmed for films like Saagar, Karwan, Indhan, Milan (1964 film), Kangan, Darshan (1967), Soye nadiya Jaage Paani (1967) and Jahan Baje Shehnai (1968). The songs from the films were Yeh sama pyara pyara, yeh hawaein thandi thandi (singer Mala), (Yeh mausam yeh mast nazare, pyar karo to inse karo), (Tumhare liye iss dil mein itne mohabbat hai, itne mohabbat kaun karega kahan paoge kis dil mein hoge), (Din raat khayalon mein tujhe yaad karoonga, par naam tera leke main aawaz na doonga), (Hum chale chhor kar teri mehfil sanam, dil kahin na kahin to behal jayega), (Gulshan mein baharon mein tu hai), and (Chun liya ik phool ko), with Madam Noor Jahan. In 1971, when the situation worsened in Pakistan, he was not encouraged in the industry as music directors considered him a pale version of Ahmed Rushdi (who remained the greatest singer in the history of Pakistani cinema) and the film Hill Station's songs, namely Mera dil na jaane kabse tera pyar dhoondta hai and Mere seene par sar rakhdo remain his only contributions in this period. A film that was made on the Dhaka Debacle in the late 1970s, called Sangtarash, also included his numbers, namely Bol Zara Kuch Duniya Wale and Mukhre Mein Chand, but the film, despite pleadings of the film-maker to the military regime of Zia, remained unreleased. So, he went back to Bangladesh in 1975 and continued his music career there. Ahmed was married to Meena Bashir, a singer. Together they had a daughter, Humayra and a son, Raja Bashir. Ahmed died on 19 April 2014, aged 74 at his residence in Mohammadpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh. He had been suffering from various diseases including cancer.

Aitcheson's father, Joe Sr. , who went by his middle name Leiter, also pitched for the Baltimore Orioles in the minor leagues and the Brooklyn Dodgers in the majors, helped his brother Whitney found the Iron Bridge Hounds, serving as its Master of Foxhounds for many years. Introduced to the saddle at age 3, Aitcheson later worked weekends at his uncle Whitney's riding stables, cleaning barns and guiding trail rides. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Maryland, lasting one semester. Aitcheson enlisted in the United States Navy, serving four years during the Korean War as a gunner\u2019s mate on the aircraft carrier USS Oriskany. Upon his discharge, Aitcheson returned to Maryland and applied for his professional steeplechase jockey's license. Aitcheson retired as the winningest steeplechase jockey in history, posting 440 jump wins from 2,457 mounts over a career spanning more than two decades, exceeding the next highest career total by almost ten percent (42 more than Alfred P. \"Paddy\" Smithwick. ) In addition, Aitcheson holds the single season jump wins record of 40.

He was a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Ajami was an outspoken supporter of the Iraq War, the nobility of which, \"can be no doubt\". Ajami was born in Arnoun, a rocky hamlet in the south of Lebanon into a Shia Muslim family. His Shiite great-grandfather had come to Arnoun from Tabriz, Iran in the 1850s. In Arabic, the word \"Ajami\" means \"non-Arab\"; or \"non-Arabic-speaker\", specifically \"Persian\", \"Persian speaker\". Ajami arrived in the United States in the fall of 1963, just before he turned 18. He did some of his undergraduate work at Eastern Oregon College (now Eastern Oregon University) in La Grande, Oregon. He did his graduate work at the University of Washington, where he wrote his thesis on international relations and world government, and earned a PhD. In 1973 Ajami joined the politics department of Princeton University. He made a name for himself there as a vocal supporter of Palestinian self-determination. In 1980, the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University named him director of Middle East studies. He joined the Hoover Institution in 2011. Ajami was an advisor to United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as well as a friend and colleague of Paul Wolfowitz. Ajami was a frequent contributor on Middle Eastern issues and contemporary international history to The New York Times Book Review, Foreign Affairs, The New Republic, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other journals and periodicals. He was also a contributor and close friend to Anderson Cooper of CNN. He was also a frequent guest on Fox News Channel's \"America's News Headquarters w/ Uma Pemmaraju\" Ajami frequently appeared on PBS, CBS, CNN and Fox News. In \"The Fate of Nonalignment,\" an essay in the Winter 1980/81 issue of the journal Foreign Affairs, Ajami outlined how the third world has fared in a context of nonalignment in post Cold war politics. In 1980, he accepted an offer from Johns Hopkins University to become director of Middle East Studies at their international relations graduate program in Washington, D. C. : the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). He holds an endowed chair as the Majid Khadduri professor. A year after arriving at SAIS, Ajami published his first book, The Arab Predicament, which analyzed what Ajami described as an intellectual and political crisis that swept the Arab world following its defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Subsequently, Ajami has written several other books: The Dream Palace of the Arabs: A Generation's Odyssey (1998), Beirut: City of Regrets (1988), and The Vanished Imam: Musa Al-Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon (1986). In The Dream Palace of the Arabs: A Generation's Odyssey, Ajami surveyed the intellectual landscape in the Arab world and Iran, in what was in some ways an autobiography as well as a sequel to \"The Arab Predicament. \" On Middle Eastern politics, he wrote of \"a world where triumph rarely comes with mercy or moderation. \" On Pan-Arabism, he described the ideology as \"Sunni dominion dressed in secular garb. \" Ajami's most recent book: The Foreigner's Gift: The Americans, The Arabs and The Iraqis in Iraq (2006), is about the American invasion of Iraq. One notable contribution Ajami made in the September October 1993 issue of Foreign Affairs was a rebuttal to Samuel Huntington\u2019s \"The Clash of Civilizations?\", regarding the state and future of international relations after the Cold War. According to Judith Miller, Ajami continued to argue that militant Islamism of the type represented by Al Qaeda had peaked and was fading into insignificance. Huntington presents a world divided at the highest level into eight civilizations, and includes a number of countries that are \"torn\" between two civilizations, arguing that these civilizational divides are far more fundamental than economic interests, ideology, and regimes, and that the world is becoming a smaller place with increasingly close interactions. He further claims that the pre-eminence of a so-called \"kin-country\" syndrome will provide a civilizational rallying point that will replace political ideology and traditional \"balance of power\" considerations for relations between states and nations, resulting in a division between the West and \"the rest\" creating a backlash against Western values (which supposedly \"differ fundamentally\" from those prevalent in other civilizations). In his article \"The Summoning\", Ajami criticises Huntington for ignoring the empirical complexities and state interests which drive conflicts in and between civilizations. Ajami believes that states will remain the dominant factor influencing the global framework and interaction. He also argues that civilizational ties are only utilized by states and groups when it is in their best interest to do so and that modernity and secularism are here to stay, especially in places with considerable struggles to obtain them, and he cites the example of the Indian middle class. Ajami also believes that civilizations do not control states; rather, states control civilizations. Ajami later relented on his initial criticism of Huntington's theories in the January 6, 2008 issue of the New York Times Book Review in an article titled \"The Clash\" in which he wrote that \"Huntington\u2019s thesis about a civilizational clash seems more compelling to me than the critique I provided at that time. \" Ajami was an outspoken supporter of the Iraq War, which he believed \u201cissued out of a deep American frustration. . . with the culture of terrorism that had put down roots in Arab lands. \"In an August 2002 speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, US Vice President Dick Cheney sought to assuage concerns about the anticipated US invasion of Iraq, stating: \"As for the reaction of the Arab 'street,' the Middle East expert Professor Fouad Ajami predicts that after liberation, the streets in Basra and Baghdad are 'sure to erupt in joy in the same way the throngs in Kabul greeted the Americans. '\"Ajami cautioned the United States about the likely negative consequences of the Iraq War. In a 2003 essay in Foreign Affairs, \"Iraq and the Arabs' Future,\" Ajami wrote, There should be no illusions about the sort of Arab landscape that America is destined to find if, or when, it embarks on a war against the Iraqi regime. There would be no \"hearts and minds\" to be won in the Arab world, no public diplomacy that would convince the overwhelming majority of Arabs that this war would be a just war. An American expedition in the wake of thwarted UN inspections would be seen by the vast majority of Arabs as an imperial reach into their world, a favor to Israel, or a way for the United States to secure control over Iraq's oil. No hearing would be given to the great foreign power. But he also goes on to say: America ought to be able to live with this distrust and discount a good deal of this anti-Americanism as the \"road rage\" of a thwarted Arab world \u2013 the congenital condition of a culture yet to take full responsibility for its self-inflicted wounds. There is no need to pay excessive deference to the political pieties and givens of the region. Indeed, this is one of those settings where a reforming foreign power's simpler guidelines offer a better way than the region's age-old prohibitions and defects. Ajami retained a positive view of the war three years later. In a 2006 book on the invasion and its aftermath, he described it as a noble effort, and argued that despite many unhappy consequences, it was too soon to write it off as a failure. Vice President Cheney cited Ajami again in an October 21, 2007 speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, stating, \"We have no illusions about the road ahead. As Fouad Ajami said recently, Iraq is not yet 'a country at peace, and all its furies have not burned out, but a measure of order has begun to stick on the ground. '\"Eight days after U. S. President Barack Obama took office, a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece by Ajami called Obama a \"messenger of the old, settled ways,\" claimed that the George W. Bush administration's diplomacy had had \"revolutionary impact,\" and chided Obama for not praising the Iraq War. Ajami credited the Egyptian Revolution and Tunisian revolution to the Iraq War and Bush's advocacy of democracy: [Bush] can definitely claim paternity. . . One despot fell in 2003. We decapitated him. Two despots, in Tunisia and Egypt, fell, and there is absolutely a direct connection between what happened in Iraq in 2003 and what's happening today throughout the rest of the Arab world. He also stated, however, that It wasn't American tanks [that brought about this moment]. . . It was a homegrown enterprise. It was Egyptians, Tunisians, Libyans conquering their fear \u2013 people went out and conquered fear and did something amazing. In June 2011, Ajami wrote an article for The New Republic arguing that the U. S. troops should remain in Iraq, writing that \"the United States will have to be prepared for and accept the losses and adversity that are an integral part of staying on, rightly, in so tangled and difficult a setting. \" On June 13, 2011 he wrote in the Wall Street Journal about the unrest in Syria that \"The mask of the Assad regime finally falls. . . \" On June 22, 2014, Ajami died from prostate cancer at a summer home in Maine, aged 68. Ajami was a 1982 winner of a five-year MacArthur Prize Fellowship in the arts and sciences. In 2006, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Bush, and the Bradley Prize, and in 2011 he earned the Benjamin Franklin Award for public service, and the Eric Breindel Award for Excellence in Opinion Journalism. Ajami was a member of the Board of Directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Board of Advisors of the journal Foreign Affairs.

F. Ade Ajayi, (26 May 1929 \u2013 9 August 2014) was a Nigerian historian and a member of the Ibadan school, a group of scholars interested in introducing African perspectives to African history and focusing on the internal historical forces that shaped African lives. Ade Ajayi favours the use of historical continuity more often than focusing on events only as powerful agents of change that can move the basic foundations of cultures and mould them into new ones. Instead, he sees many critical events in African life, sometimes as weathering episodes which still leave some parts of the core of Africans intact. He also employs a less passionate style in his works, especially in his early writings, using subtle criticism of controversial issues of the times. Ajayi was born in Ikole-Ekiti on 26 May 1929, his father was a personal assistant of the Oba of Ikole during the era of Native Authorities. He started education at St Paul's School, Ikole, at the age of five. He then proceeded to Ekiti Central School (now Christ's School Ado Ekiti) for preparation as a pupil teacher. However, after hearing from a friend about Igbobi College in Lagos, he decided to try his luck and applied. Thereafter, he gained admission into the college, and equipped with a scholarship from the Ikole Ekiti Native authority, he went to Lagos for secondary education. After completing his studies at Igbobi, he gained admission to the University of Ibadan, where he was to pick between History, Latin or English for his degree. He chose History. In 1952, he travelled abroad and studied at Leicester University, under the tutelage of Professor Jack Simmons, a brilliant Oxford-trained historian. In 1956 he married Christie Ade Ajayi n\u00e9e Martins. After graduation, he was a research fellow at the Institute of Historical Research, London from 1957\u20131958. He later returned to Nigeria and joined the history department of the University of Ibadan. In 1964, he was made Dean of Arts at the University and later promoted a deputy Vice-Chancellor. After his stint as deputy Vice-Chancellor, he was made the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos in 1972. During his tenure, several buildings were constructed and improvements were made to student accommodation. King Jaja hall was built in 1973 and extensions were made to Queen Amina and Queen Moremi halls respectively. The twilight of his career as Vice-Chancellor was a controversial one, the then Obasanjo regime had introduced some student fees to the dismay of the students, who demanded free education. Students then decided to riot, a situation which was termed Ali must go. During the protest and riots, a student named Akintunde Ojo was shot by the police. At the time his mother was rumoured to be a mistress of Obasanjo. The ensuing protest by students against the killing led opportunists to seize the situation and cause mayhem. In 1978, he was arbitrarily relieved of his position and returned to Ibadan, where he continued his effort in historical scholarship. In 1993, Ajayi was awarded the \"Distinguished Africanist Award\" by the African Studies Association. In 1994, he became an Honorary Fellow of SOAS. On 9 August 2014, he died at the age of 85 and was buried in his native Ikole Ekiti. As an early writer of Nigerian and African history, though not a pioneer like Kenneth Dike, Ajayi brought considerable respect to the Ibadan School and African research. He is known for the arduous research and rigorous effort he puts into his work. By extensive use of oral sources in some of his works such as pre-twentieth century Yoruba history, he was able to weigh, balance and assay each and all of his sources, uncovering a pathway towards facts in the period which was scarce in written and non-prejudiced forms. Ajayi also tries to be dispassionate in his writings, especially when writing about controversial or passionate subjects in African history. In an article on the history of Yoruba writing, he was able to appraise critically and with resignation, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, a hero to Ade Ajayi. His style of rigorous research presented new pathways in African historiography and augmented awareness among scholarly circles outside the continent to African methodologies and perceptions. By weighing sources both written and oral, he was able to find new issues of interest that formed the basis of British colonisation of Lagos, balancing official British documentation of the event with additional material. Another theme in many of his works is nationalism. Ajayi sees religious currents as setting the foundation for modern Nigerian nationalism. The Fulani Jihad of the early twentieth century set a basis for a common front, while Christian missionaries such as CMS, had laid the foundation for a movement towards unity in the south. The missionaries also established schools that created a new educated class who later broke with the Europeans and fought for a new social and political order. However, the new order embraced European contemporary social, political and economic structures as ideals of the new society. Ajayi, however, with gradation has expressed a much more critical stance on the need to embrace Pan-Africanism as the foundation of nationalism. Yoruba Warfare in the Nineteenth century.

He used another pen name, Katsuhiko Otsuji (\u5c3e\u8fbb \u514b\u5f66, Otsuji Katsuhiko), for literary works. Akasegawa was born in 1937 in Yokohama, and moved to Ashiya, \u014cita and Nagoya in his childhood because of his father's job. Shusaku Arakawa was a high school classmate in Nagoya. In 1960, Akasegawa became involved within the Neo-Dada Organizers, along with Ushio Shinohara, Shusaku Arakawa, and Masanobu Yoshimura. He formed the Hi-Red Center with Jiro Takamatsu and Natsuyuki Nakanishi in 1963, which was a group of artists that presented their works as a collective in Japan; they performed happenings within the Hi-Red Center. Akasegawa was also associated with the avant-garde. In the 1970s he used the idea of Hyper-Art (ch\u014dgeijutsu), an ordinary but useless street object that happened to look like a conceptual artwork despite nobody having intended this. He called such things Hyperart Thomasson (named for Yomiuri Giants outfielder Gary Thomasson) and published photographs of them first within the magazine Shashin Jidai and later within books. As \"Katsuhiko Otsuji,\" he received the Akutagawa Prize in 1981 for his short story, \"Chichi ga kieta\". Akasegawa is known for many humorous essays, and his 1998 book R\u014djinryoku was a bestseller. Akasegawa was fond of old cameras, especially Leicas, and from 1992 to around 2009, he joined Yutaka Takanashi and Y\u016btokutaishi Akiyama in the photographers' group Raika D\u014dmei, which held numerous exhibitions. In January 1963, Akasegawa sent out invitations to a solo exhibition at a gallery in Tokyo. The announcement was delivered to several close friends in a cash envelope sent through the postal service. The announcement itself was a 1,000-yen note reproduced in monochromatic colors on the front, with relevant information regarding the exhibit on the back. He produced four more during the next year. In January 1964, his 1,000-yen note partial reproductions became noticed by the police and he was indicted for creating imitations of banknotes, in violation of the 1894 Law Controlling the Imitation of Currency and Securities. The language of the law was quite vague, prohibiting any manufacture or sale of objects with an exterior front that may \u201cbe confused for currency or securities\u201d. In August 1966, he went on trial for what was dubbed the \"Thousand-Yen Bill Incident\". In June 1967, he was found guilty with a three-month suspended sentence. He appealed twice. The decision was upheld in 1970. Obuje o motta musansha (\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u3092\u6301\u3063\u305f\u7121\u7523\u8005). Tokyo: Gendai Shis\u014dsha, 1970.

At International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), he was president between 1983 and 1989, the CEO from 1985 until 1993, and chairman between 1986 and 1993. Akers attended Yale, and while there became a brother of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter). Akers ascended to CEO as a result of support from one of his predecessors, Frank Cary. In 1989, a young Sam Palmisano was appointed as Aker's assistant; decades later Palmisano would serve as chairman and CEO. Akers was credited with simplifying the company's bureaucracy to focus more on profits. On January 29, 1988, in a sweeping restructuring intended to reverse three years of disappointing performance, Akers created five new, highly autonomous organizations responsible for all of the company's innovation, design and manufacturing. The moves were intended to greatly decentralize the company, which had been seen as bloated and unable to keep up with competition, and give significantly more responsibility to a younger generation of managers, while significantly reducing the role of the company's Armonk, N. Y. , headquarters in the day-to-day operations. Under the plan, thousands of employees had to switch jobs or find themselves working for new managers. Akers' vision was to autonomize each division into \"Baby Blues\" with the aim of spinning them off from \"Big Blue\". Akers also presided over a major downsizing of IBM's workforce, cutting down from 407,000 to 360,000 by the end of 1991. The company had previously had a lifetime employment policy but successive voluntary buyouts and the first-ever layoff in March 1993, caused a morale crisis. Akers also closed ten plants and trimmed manufacturing capacity by forty percent. On Tuesday, January 26, 1993, Akers was forced to announce his resignation, after several months of IBM insisting that it had full confidence in his leadership. The company had posted a $5 billion annual loss, the largest in corporate history. The dividend was also slashed from $1. 21 to 54 cents, after the company had failed to make enough profit to cover its dividend payments for eight business quarters. IBM president Jack Kuehler was shifted to the post of vice chairman, while finance director Frank Metz was also ousted. Paul Rizzo, a rival with Akers for the CEO position back in 1985 who had retired in 1987 was restored to the post of vice-chairman and appointed finance director. Akers remained as chief executive for three months while a committee of directors chose a successor, long speculated to be an outsider. The management coup was mounted by longtime IBM director Jim Burke , who organized secret meetings between Rizzo and outsider Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. to examine the company's problems. It was also speculated that several entities were dissatisfied with losing their power on the board of directors and the declining stock price, including the banks which were once IBM's largest shareholders, as well as Aker's predecessors as CEO, John Opel and Frank Cary. Akers retired as chairman and CEO of IBM on April 1, 1993. He was succeeded in both positions by Gerstner, the first CEO in IBM's history to attain the position from outside the company. Akers was chief executive during IBM's decline in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs described Akers as \"smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson, but he didn\u2019t know anything about product. \u201dThe company's difficulties weren't caused by Akers alone, as some suggested that he was merely doing what he had been \"programmed\" to do by an outdated \"IBM system\", while a complacent board of directors was also blamed. Akers was also on the board of directors of Lehman Brothers when it filed for bankruptcy. Akers died of a stroke at age 79 in Boston, Massachusetts on August 22, 2014.

All he, his family and lawyer have denied the charge. Russian diplomats attached to the embassy in Islamabad have all claimed that he was denied counselor support or any contact with them. Akhlas Akhlaq was a Russian citizen born in the Soviet city of Volgograd in the year 1981. He was born to a Soviet mother and a Pakistani father of Kashmiri ethnicity. He later moved to Pakistan as an adult to help his father with his business. On the way there, he along with his brother, stopped in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. Once there, they were short of money and their father contacted the Pakistani ambassador, whom was a friend of his to lend them some money. They also applied for a Pakistani visa at the embassy. They arrived in Karachi, Pakistan in March 2001 and stayed with their father there. More than two years later in December 2003, Akhlas disappeared in a district in Azad Kashmir and was reportedly arrested by members of the Pakistani military intelligence. His father alleged that he was told by an intelligence agent that he would risk compromising his sons safety if he reported his sons conditions. Other rumours had surfaced on the Internet that he attempted to evade arrest and was pursued by Rangers up till the Russian embassy and took refuge there while the Rangers surrounded the embassy, until he came out. Akhlaq was charged in a military court and found guilty of terrorism in an alleged attempt to murder Pervez Musharraf. His mother claimed to have lost all contact with him in 2001. His execution was postponed as the death penalty has been suspended under former president Asif Zardari's era. But following the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, it was restored under the current Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Akhlaq was shortly later executed in a jail in the Pakistani city of Faisalabad. The execution was shortly postponed until his mother arrived in Pakistan and so that he could meet his parents before he would be put to death. His mother claimed that her son was charged and executed \"for nothing\" and no evidence has been provided at all for his involvement in the assassination attempt. Dawn News later reported that the body of the executed Akhlaq had gone missing for about two days before being found. Following the execution and lack of evidence presented to support the verdict, the Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that it would work in the future to prevent the execution of its citizens abroad. The Russian embassy in Islamabad also stated that they regretted that Pakistani officials failed to inform them their decision to proceed with the death sentence against the accused individual. It was also rumored that a Russian delegation's visit to Pakistan had been snubbed over the Pakistani government's refusal to respond to the embassy's pleas to allow consular access and assistance to the individual's case.

He was considered one of the most important modern Lebanese poets. He is most famous for his advocacy on behalf of codifying the spoken Lebanese language, as a competency distinct from Standard Arabic, to be written in a modern modified Roman script consisting of 36 symbols that he deemed an evolution of the Phoenician Alphabet. Although he was a gifted Arabist, producing some of the masterpieces of modern Arabic belle lettres in Standard Classical Arabic, his most exquisite works remained in his \"native language,\" in what he referred to as the \"Lebanese language. \" His writings include poetry and prose both in Lebanese dialect and in classical Arabic language. He has also written theatre pieces and authored lyrics for many popular songs. Akl was born in 1912 to a Maronite family in the city of Zahle, Ottoman Lebanon. After losing his grandfather at the age of 14, he had to drop out of school because of laziness and later worked as a teacher and then as a journalist. He then studied theology, literature and Islamic history, becoming a university instructor and subsequently lecturing in a number of Lebanese universities, educational and policy institutes. He died in Beirut, Lebanon at the age of 102 or 103. During his early years, Akl was an adherent of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0645\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a) led by Antun Saadeh, eventually being expelled by Saadeh due to irreconcilable ideological disputes. Akl adopted a powerful doctrine of the authentic millennial character of Lebanon resonating with an exalted sense of Lebanese dignity. His admiration to the Lebanese history and culture was marked by strong enmity towards an Arab identity of Lebanon. He was quoted saying, \u201cI would cut off my right hand just not to be an Arab\u201d. In 1968 he stated that literary Arabic would vanish from Lebanon. For Akl Lebanon was the cradle of culture and the inheritor of the Oriental civilization, well before the arrival of the Arabs on the historical stage. He emphasized the Phoenician legacy of the Lebanese people. He is known for his radical Lebanese nationalistic sentiments; in 1972, he helped found the Lebanese Renewal Party (in Arabic \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062c\u062f\u0651\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a transliterated as Hizb al Tajaddod al Lubnaani) which was proposed by May Murr, a well known writer and researcher of ancient Lebanese history and a staunch supporter of Akl. This party was a non-sectarian party that adhered to Lebanese Nationalism. During the Lebanese Civil War, Akl served as the spiritual leader of the Lebanese Nationalist movement Guardians of the Cedars (in Arabic \u062d\u0631\u0651\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632), which was led by \u00c9tienne Saqr. Akl was an ideologue for promotion of the Lebanese language as independent of Arabic language. Although acknowledging the influence of Arabic, he argued that Lebanese language was equally if not more influenced by Phoenician languages and promoted the use of the Lebanese dialect written in a modified Latin alphabet, rather than the Arabic one. His designed alphabet for the Lebanese language using the Latin alphabet in addition to a few newly designed letters and some accented Latin letters to suit the Lebanese phonology. The proposed Lebanese alphabet designed by Akl contained 36 letters. The proposed alphabet was as follows: Starting in the 1970s Akl offered a prize to whoever authored the best essay in Lebanese Arabic. Since then the Said Akl awards have been granted to many Lebanese intellectuals and artists. He published his poetry book Yara completely using his proposed Lebanese alphabet, thus becoming the first book ever to be published in this form. In later years, he also published his poetry book Khumasiyyat in the same alphabet. Akl published the tabloid newspaper Lebnaan using the Lebanese dialect. It was published in two versions, \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646 (transliteration and pronunciation Lubnan which means Lebanon in Arabic language) using Lebanese dialect written in traditional Arabic alphabet, the other Lebnaan (Lebanese Arabic for Lebanon) in his proposed Lebanese Latin-based alphabet. Akl has numerous writings ranging from theatrical plays, epics, poetry and song lyrics. His first published work was released in 1935, a theatrical play written in Arabic. His works are written in either Lebanese Arabic, literary Arabic, or French.

Alan achieved fame through a series of stunts staged for the media. He made headline news in 1949 when a \"buried alive\" stunt, performed for Pathe News, nearly went wrong. He is credited with devising the burning-rope straitjacket escape, in which he is suspended upside-down from a crane with a length of thick rope doused with petrol; once ignited there is a short time to escape before the rope burns through. He appeared in a number of television magic shows, including The Magic of David Copperfield. He also \"taught\" the inmates of Wormwood Scrubs prison how to escape from handcuffs in his performance with a number of other magicians. In more recent years he was seen on the Channel 4 TV show The Secret Cabaret with Simon Drake. He was proprietor of Alan Alan's Magic Spot, a magic shop based on Southampton Row, London until its lease expired in the mid-1990s.

From 2012 to 2014, she conducted training and sensitization of the police forces of Tucum\u00e1n Province for the full application of the Gender Identity Law. Mariana Alarc\u00f3n was born in Tucum\u00e1n Province and grew up in the San Miguel neighborhood of Juan XXIII, nicknamed \"La Bombilla\" for its high rates of social violence. She began to manifest her trans identity at a very young age, enduring discrimination that led her to abandon her studies after finishing primary school. In 2011 Alarc\u00f3n was approached to participate in the Cris\u00e1lida Popular Library of Gender, Sexual Affective Diversity, and Human Rights of Tucum\u00e1n. Through Cris\u00e1lida, she advocated for sanction of the Gender Identity Law project, which was enacted on 24 May 2012 as Law 26. 743. Based on this, Alarc\u00f3n was one of the first transgender people to have access to the correction of identification documents to reflect her gender identity.

Noted especially for her portrayals of the lyric heroines of Verdi and Puccini, Albanese was a leading artist with the Metropolitan Opera from 1940 to 1966. She also made many recordings and was chairwoman of The Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation, which is dedicated to assisting young artists and singers. Felicia Albanese was born in Noic\u00e0ttaro, today part of Torre a Mare, a quarter of Bari, Italy, in 1909. She made her unofficial debut in Milan in 1934, when she replaced another soprano in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, the role for which she would be celebrated. Over 40 years, she sang more than 300 performances of Cio-Cio-San. Although she has been praised for many of her roles, including Mim\u00ec, Violetta, Li\u00f9 and Manon Lescaut, it is her portrayal of the geisha which has remained her best known. Her connection with that work began early with her teacher, Giuseppina Baldassare-Tedeschi, a contemporary of the composer, and an important exponent of the title role in the previous generation. There is some controversy regarding when she made her formal debut. It was either in that same year (1934) at the Teatro Municipale in Bari, singing in La boh\u00e8me, or in Parma, or in Milan in 1935 in Madama Butterfly. By the end of that year, she had debuted at La Scala as Lauretta in Gianni Schicchi. She soon realized great success all over the world, especially for her performances in Carmen, L'amico Fritz and Madama Butterfly in Italy, France and England. Albanese made her Metropolitan Opera debut on February 9, 1940, in the first of 72 performances as Madama Butterfly at the old Metropolitan Opera House in spite of the fact that after the December 7, 1941 Pearl Harbor attack, performances of that opera were banned in the U. S. until the end of World War II. Her success was instantaneous, and Albanese remained at the Met for 26 seasons, performing a total of 427 performances of 17 roles in 16 operas. She left the company in 1966 in a dispute with General Manager Sir Rudolf Bing, without a grand farewell. After performing in four productions during 1965/66, she was scheduled for only one performance the next season. She returned her contract unsigned. Arturo Toscanini invited Albanese to join his broadcast concert performances of La boh\u00e8me and La traviata with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in NBC's Studio 8H in 1946. Both performances were later issued on LP and CD by RCA Victor. In 1959, Albanese sang for thousands of radio listeners in collaboration with Alfredo Antonini, Richard Tucker and members of the New York Philharmonic during the popular \"Italian Night\" broadcasts from Lewisohn Stadium in New York City. She and her colleagues were showcased in selections from operas by Giacomo Puccini including: Tosca, La boh\u00e8me, Turandot, Manon Lescaut and Madama Butterfly. She was also a mainstay at the San Francisco Opera where she sang between 1941 and 1961, performing 22 roles in 120 performances over 20 seasons, remaining in part because of her admiration for its director, Gaetano Merola. Throughout her career, she continued to perform widely in recital, concert, and opera, she was heard throughout the country; she participated in benefits, entertained the troops, had her own weekly radio show, was a guest on other broadcasts and telecasts, and recorded frequently. Albanese went to San Francisco in the summer of 1972 for the special gala concert at Sigmund Stern Recreation Grove celebrating the 50th anniversary of the San Francisco Opera. Joining numerous colleagues who had sung with the company, Albanese sang the duet from Madama Butterfly with tenor Frederick Jagel, accompanied by the San Francisco Opera Orchestra conducted by longtime director Kurt Herbert Adler. Even after a career spanning seven decades, Albanese continued to perform occasionally. After hearing her sing the national anthem during a Met opening, Stephen Sondheim and Thomas Z. Shepard cast her as operetta diva Heidi Schiller in Sondheim's Follies in concert with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in 1985. During the 1987 spring season of the Theatre Under the Stars in Houston, Texas, Albanese starred in a stage revival of Follies, which was a great success. Albanese died on August 15, 2014, at the age of 105 in her home in Manhattan. Her popularity in La traviata was such that she sang more performances of that opera at the Met and the San Francisco Opera than any other singer in either company's history. Schuyler Chapin describes her as \"a splendid former prima donna of the Italian repertoire, remembered by old-timers as the frailest Mim\u00ec, the tenderest Butterfly, and perhaps the most haunting of modern Violettas. \"Her voice had a distinctive character which the Italians call a lirico spinto, marked by its quick vibrato, incisive diction, intensity of attack and unwavering emotional impact. During her career she performed with many of the contemporary greats of opera\u2014Beniamino Gigli, Claudia Muzio, Jussi Bj\u00f6rling, and Franco Corelli. She worked with some of the best conductors of her time, but it is her work with Toscanini that has endured. Despite her talent and numerous performances, she was not the best known of her contemporaries, overshadowed in her day by Zinka Milanov, Maria Callas, Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles and Renata Tebaldi. Alfredo Vecchio, a frequent member of the audience at her performances, gave the following tribute to the career of Albanese at the Columbus Club, Park Avenue, New York City, in 1986: Like all great artists, Licia's specific ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, lay in the fact that technique for this artist at least was always a means to an end and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times. ' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest. To all of her work, Albanese brought passion and commitment, with her rich soprano voice, equalized throughout its range, thrilling in its climaxes. However, despite her repeated performances, she never fell into routine. As she explained in a 2004 interview with Allan Ulrich of the San Francisco Chronicle, \"I always changed every performance. I was never boring, and I am against copying. What I learned from the great singers was not to copy, but that the drama is in the music. \" Albanese appeared in the very first live telecast from the Metropolitan Opera, Verdi's Otello, opposite Ram\u00f3n Vinay and Leonard Warren, conducted by Fritz Busch. One of the first generation of opera singers to appear widely in recordings and on the radio, her performances, now reappearing on both compact disc and video, have provided a lasting testament to her ability. From these recordings, future generations will be able to form some impression of what she was like as a singer and to understand what made her unique as an artist. Arturo Toscanini invited Albanese to sing Mim\u00ec in the 1946 NBC Symphony Orchestra performance of La boh\u00e8me. The broadcast marked the 50th anniversary of the opera's premiere which he had conducted in 1896. The following season Toscanini cast her again, this time as Violetta in a now-classic performance of La traviata, broadcast nationally on NBC Radio on December 1 and 8, 1946. Both performances were subsequently released on records by RCA Victor and have since continuously remained in print. Albanese was noted for the grace with which she performed La traviata under the maestro's famously intense direction. \"Maria Callas once asked me how I ever got through it, but Toscanini wanted it that way,\" Albanese later recalled. \"'It should be like champagne,' he said. I complained to him, and he said, 'You can do it. ' Before I sang the part, I went to a hospital to study the behavior of people with tuberculosis and I learned that sometimes they can be hysterical. \"She recorded mainly for RCA Victor. Among her recordings are Bizet's Carmen under the direction of Fritz Reiner, with Ris\u00eb Stevens and Jan Peerce (1951) and Puccini's Manon Lescaut with Jussi Bj\u00f6rling and Robert Merrill, conducted by Jonel Perlea (1954). For a 1951 recording conducted by Leopold Stokowski of Tatiana's Letter Scene from Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, a part she had never sung before, she learnt Russian especially for the occasion. Soprano Teresa Stratas was quoted as crediting a Metropolitan Opera performance of La traviata starring Albanese at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, with motivating her toward a singing career. Albanese was chairman of The Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation, founded in 1974 and dedicated to assisting young artists and singers. She also served as a trustee of the Bagby Foundation. She worked with the Juilliard School of Music, the Manhattan School of Music, and Marymount Manhattan College, and conducted master classes throughout the world. Albanese became a United States citizen in 1945. On October 5, 1995, President Bill Clinton presented her with the National Medal of Honor for the Arts. She received awards and honorary degrees from Marymount Manhattan College, Montclair State Teachers College, Saint Peter's College, New Jersey, Seton Hall University, University of South Florida, Fairfield University, Siena College, Caldwell College, and Fairleigh Dickinson University. She was awarded the prestigious Handel Medallion, the highest official honor given by the City of New York and presented to individuals for their contributions to the city's cultural life, from Rudolph Giuliani in 2000. At the ceremony, Mayor Giuliani commemorated the career of a woman who is \"without question [one] of the most loved and respected performers in the world. \" The Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation website Recording of \"Libiamo ne' lieti calici\" from La traviata, Albanese and Jan Peerce, Toscanini conducting.

S. state of Michigan. Albosta was born in Saginaw, Michigan and attended Saginaw and Chesaning public schools. He graduated from Chesaning Agricultural School, and attended Delta College in Bay City. He served in the United States Navy, was a farmer, owner, and developer of Misteguay Creek Farms. He served as Albee Township Trustee and was associate director of the Saginaw County Soil Conservation District. A Democrat, he was Saginaw County Commissioner from 1970 to 1974 and served in the Michigan State House of Representatives from 1974 to 1976, representing the 86th District. In 1976, he first ran for the United States House of Representatives in Michigan's 10th congressional district losing to longtime incumbent Al Cederberg. Albosta sought a rematch against Cederberg in 1978. In a major upset, he defeated Cederberg to become the first Democrat to represent this district in 84 years. He was reelected twice, serving from January 3, 1979 to January 3, 1985. As a member of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, among others, Rep. Albosta offered amendments that improved the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, popularly known as \"Superfund\" including a provision requiring the Center for Disease Control to study the health histories of victims of exposure to hazardous substances in an effort to determine the effects of that exposure or the epidemiology of diseases related to exposures such as those that had inspired Albosta to run for Congress after he led the successful investigation and redress efforts in the wake of the spill of PBBs in cattle feed in Michigan. Albosta was also chair of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee's Subcommittee on Human Resources which conducted an investigation into the Unauthorized Transfers of Nonpublic Information During the 1980 Presidential Election which published its findings in May 1984 in Committee Print 98-12. The investigation revealed that the Reagan Campaign included three committees or groups devoted to monitoring and addressing the situation of the hostages held by Iran during the period preceding the 1980 Presidential election, which collectively referred to the potential release of the hostages before the November election as the \"October Surprise\". Some observers and later investigations by others concluded after the release of the hostages shortly after President Reagan's inauguration that the presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan orchestrated delaying the release of U. S. hostages held by Iran until after the election. The Albosta Subcommittee Report also confirmed that the Reagan campaign received, copied and used \"a pilfered copy\" of President Carter's debate briefing book, and related materials from the National Security Council, the term \"pilfered\" being used by Michigan Republican Congressman David Stockman in a statement on October 28, 1980 describing how he had used the book to prepare candidate Reagan for the debate with President Carter, to a group of about 65 people, according to newspaper reports of Rep. Stockman's speech printed in the Elkhart Truth and Dowagiac Daily News on Wednesday, October 29. The controversy became known as Debategate. During the investigation, William Casey, then-director of the CIA who had been Reagan's campaign director, said that the person who delivered the leaked briefing books to him was Paul Corbin, a former aide to Robert Kennedy and a disgruntled Ted Kennedy supporter. The subcommittee's final report in 1984 reported on scores of interviews with Reagan's former campaign staff and others. It did not conclusively identify the specific individuals within the Carter White House who may have provided the briefing books, but did interview several who may have done so, reported that some witness statements were not entirely candid and seconded the finding of United States District Court Judge Harold Green that the Reagan Administration was required by the Ethics in Government Act to appoint an independent counsel or special prosecutor to conduct an investigation and determine whether to seek an indictment against any of the high-level presidential appointees who had knowingly received and used the stolen White House briefing book in violation of the law. Attorney General Ed Meese declined to appoint an independent counsel. In the late summer of 1984 Rep. Albosta cosponsored a bill introduced by Rep. John LaFalce to provide compensation for victims of hazardous substances. This did not play well with the Dow Chemical Company, headquartered in Albosta's district in Midland, Michigan. Executives and board members of Dow Chemical urged their employees and retirees to oppose Rep. Albosta and he was defeated in November by future state Attorney General Bill Schuette. Albosta sought a rematch against Schuette in 1986; he won the Democratic primary, but lost the general election and retired from politics. He was a resident of St. Charles, Michigan. His daughter, Christine C. White, was appointed in March 2003 as the Director of Agriculture Policy for the Michigan Department of Agriculture.

He was one of the first European civil servants appointed in 1958 and served as Director-General of the Directorate-General for Competition from 1967 to 1970. He served as Minister President of the state of Lower Saxony from 1976 to 1990. He was the father of the politician Ursula von der Leyen, the President-elect of the European Commission. Ernst Albrecht was the son of the psychologist, psychotherapist and medical doctor Carl Albrecht, who was known for developing a new method of meditation; the Albrecht family had been among the h\u00fcbsche (\"genteel\") families of the Electorate of Hanover as doctors, jurists and civil servants since the 17th century, but his immediate ancestors had been wealthy cotton merchants in Bremen and members of the city-state's Hanseatic elite in the 19th and 20th centuries. His grandmother Mary Ladson Robertson was an American of prominent planter class origin from Charleston, South Carolina, and a descendant of James H. Ladson and several colonial governors. Ernst Albrecht studied law and economics. In 1958 he moved to Brussels where he became one of the first European civil servants. He initially served as the Chef de Cabinet to the European Commissioner for Competition Hans von der Groeben in the Hallstein Commission, and in 1967, at the age of 37, he became the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Competition. He entered politics in his native Germany when he was elected to the Lower Saxon Landtag (parliament) in 1970, and moved to Hanover with his family the following year. From 1971 to 1976, he was CEO of Bahlsen. When Alfred Kubel resigned from the office of State Premier in 1976, Albrecht was unexpectedly elected as his successor. Since he received three more votes than his party had representatives in the Legislative Assembly, some members of the governing coalition SPD and FDP must have secretly voted for him. He was re-elected in state parliament elections in 1978, 1982 and 1986. Albrecht is known for the decision to make the County of L\u00fcchow-Dannenberg the state's \"nuclear district\"; only a radioactive waste dump at Gorleben was realized, however. During his tenure Albrecht was embroiled in an unusually large number of political scandals; most famously, the Celle Hole. In 1980, Albrecht launched a campaign for election as Chancellor, but he lost out to fellow conservative Franz-Josef Strau\u00df. Albrecht lost the 1990 state elections to Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who later became Chancellor. Ernst Albrecht married Heidi Adele Stromeyer (1928\u20132002) in 1953.

He died at the age of 84 in December 2014. "}, {"text": "Gerd Albrecht (19 July 1935 \u2013 2 February 2014) was a German conductor. Albrecht was born in Essen, the son of the musicologist Hans Albrecht (1902-1961). He studied music in Kiel and in Hamburg, where his teachers included Wilhelm Br\u00fcckner-R\u00fcggeberg. He was a first-prize winner at the International Besan\u00e7on Competition for Young Conductors at age 22. His first post was as a repetiteur at the Stuttgart State Opera. Later, he became Senior Kapellmeister at the Staatstheater Mainz, and Generalmusikdirektor in L\u00fcbeck. He also held posts at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Tonhalle-Orchester Z\u00fcrich and the Hamburg State Opera. His work in contemporary opera included conducting Aribert Reimann's Lear in both its world premiere and its United States premiere, as well as making the first commercial recording of the opera. His other commercial recordings include Robert Schumann's Genoveva and Manfred, and the first commercial recording of Hans Werner Henze's Gogo no Eiko (The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea) in its revised Japanese-language version. Albrecht died at age 78 on 2 February 2014 in Berlin. In 1991, the musicians of the Czech Philharmonic picked Albrecht as its principal conductor, the first non-Czech conductor named to the post, for a tenure scheduled to last seven years beginning in 1994. The orchestra had played a part in protesting the Soviet domination of their country and reorganized as a self-governing entity. The musician's selection of Albrecht effectively meant the replacing of Czech conductor Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek, who then in 1992 resigned from his position early. Consequently, by the time that he took up the post, the orchestra was already somewhat riven. Albrecht proved effective in improving the Czech Philharmonic's finances and at raising its international profile with foreign tours. He is also acknowledged to have been a musical success, and his recordings with the orchestra included music of Ervin Schulhoff. However, a series of political conflicts led to his early resignation. In 1994, the Czech Philharmonic was invited to perform at the Vatican in a concert celebrating reconciliation between Roman Catholics and Jews. However, the invitation was to play under the American conductor Gilbert Levine, already known for his close relationship with the Vatican under Pope John Paul II and subsequently for the telecast, Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust. Albrecht vetoed the engagement, ostensibly because the orchestra was too busy, although other speculation on the actual reason for the refusal was that the Vatican did not invite Albrecht. Czech president V\u00e1clav Havel became involved, telling Albrecht that his actions were damaging the orchestra. The situation steadily deteriorated, with Albrecht painting himself in press interviews as a victim of racism and anti-German feeling and for being expected personally to atone for all past German misdeeds. He also claimed that his phone was bugged. Havel retaliated in the media with his own claims. Albrecht and B\u011blohl\u00e1vek collaborated for the 100th anniversary concert, each conducting half of it, on January 4, 1996, but Havel was conspicuously absent and members of the orchestra showed their allegiances when the time came for applause. Albrecht resigned from this post a month later asserting that his musical authority had been undermined. With the Czech Philharmonic, Albrecht conducted the first commercial recording of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's opera Dimitrij. From 2000-2004, he was principal conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, with which he made commercial recordings for such labels as Chandos. In 2003, he caused controversy when he spoke from the podium at one concert to protest the US invasion of Iraq. He later apologized for the incident. In Japan, he served as principal conductor of Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra from 1998 to 2007, and became its conductor laureate after 2007.

Karl Hans Albrecht (German: [\u02c8alb\u0281\u025b\u00e7t]; 20 February 1920 \u2013 16 July 2014) was a German entrepreneur who founded the discount supermarket chain Aldi with his brother Theo. He was for many years the richest person in Germany. In February 2014, he was ranked the 21st-richest person in the world by Hurun Report. Karl and Theo Albrecht were born and raised in a Catholic family in modest circumstances in Essen, Germany. Their father, Karl Sr, was employed as a miner and later as a baker's assistant. Their mother Anna, n\u00e9e Siepmann, had a small grocery store in the workers' quarter of Schonnebeck, a suburb of Essen. Theo completed an apprenticeship in his mother's store, while Karl worked in a delicatessen shop. Karl served in the Wehrmacht during World War II and was wounded on the Eastern Front. After the war, the brothers jointly took over their mother's business and founded Albrecht KG. They separated that company in 1961 into Aldi Nord, covering the part of Germany north of the Ruhr under Theo Albrecht, and Aldi S\u00fcd under Karl. The first Aldi (short for Albrecht Discount) was opened in 1962. In 1994, Karl Albrecht removed himself from the daily operations of Aldi S\u00fcd and took the position of chairman of the board until 2002. At the beginning of 2002, he also relinquished this position, thereby completely ceding control of the firm. As of 2010s, the business is no longer run by any of Karl Albrecht's family members. Karl Albrecht was a very reclusive man who had not taken part in public life for several years prior to his death. As a result, little is known about him. Forbes magazine reported that he had two children, neither of whom was employed by Aldi. He reportedly lived in Essen, as did his brother Theo until the latter's death. Golf was one of his hobbies, and Albrecht played the sport on his own golf course, the \u00d6schberghof, which he built in 1976. He also raised orchids. In 2014, Albrecht was listed as one of the richest people in the world with an estimated net worth of US$23. 14 billion. Previously, Forbes magazine listed him as one of the richest men in the world, with an estimated net worth in 2011 of US$25. 4 billion, which ranked him 10th in its 2012 list of billionaires \u2013 making him the oldest billionaire in the Top 20 list. Albrecht was the richest person in Germany, and the fourth-richest in Europe. Forbes topic page on Karl Albrecht Obituary in The Independent by Marcus Williamson"}, {"text": "Samson S. Alcantara (May 14, 1935 \u2013 December 26, 2014) was a Filipino lawyer and law professor. He was also the national president of the Social Justice Society, a political party accredited by the Commission on Elections, as well as the founding chairman and president of the ABAKADA-GURO partylist, a partylist group representing teachers. Alcantara was also a candidate for the 2013 Philippine Senate elections under the Social Justice Society. Alcantara finished his law studies at the Manuel L. Quezon University School of Law in 1957. Later that same year, he placed third in the Philippine Bar Examination. Alcantara began working as a law professor in 1967, specializing in political law and labor law. At present, he serves as a law professor for the University of Santo Tomas, the Manuel L. Quezon University, the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, the University of the East, and the New Era University. In 2003, Alcantara founded the Advocates and Adherents of Social Justice for School Teachers and Allied Workers (AASJS), a party-list organization composed of academic and non-academic personnel of educational institution which aims to initiate educational reforms for all levels. It participated in the party-list election in 2004, but failed to win a seat in Congress. Soon after, it changed its name to the ABAKADA GURO Partylist. Under the new name, the group succeeded in winning a congressional seat in the 2007 party-list election, with journalist Jonathan A. Dela Cruz serving as its representative. In January 2010, ABAKADA gave a press release stating that Alcantara would replace Dela Cruz as its party-list representative in Congress. The announcement came as a result of Dela Cruz's supposed resignation on December 31, 2009 in accordance with a term-sharing agreement between him and Alcantara. However, Dela Cruz reiterated that he is still the organization's representative, adding that the agreement was not approved by the members of ABAKADA. Later that year, Alcantara, along with a few members of the party, filed a petition against Dela Cruz before the Supreme Court. In the petition, Alcantara et al. asked the Supreme Court to remove Dela Cruz as party-list representative of ABAKADA and to declare him as the lawful representative of the group. The petition was junked on April 17, 2012 since the contested term had already expired, making its petition moot and academic. Alcantara filed his candidacy for senator in the 2013 elections on October 4, 2012. In December 2012, Alcantara filed a petition before the Supreme Court to stop the airing of television commercials of five government officials who are also running for senator in the upcoming election. In the petition, he stated that these officials acted against ethical standards expected from elected officials and violated \"the letter and spirit\" of the 1987 Constitution. Those named in the petition included Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, Aurora Representative Sonny Angara, San Juan Representative JV Ejercito, Cagayan Representative Jack Enrile, and Puerto Princesa City Mayor Edward Hagedorn. He died on December 26, 2014 due to massive stroke. "}, {"text": "M\u00e1ximo Luis Alc\u00f3cer (15 April 1933 \u2013 13 May 2014) was a Bolivian footballer whose career lasted for almost ten years.

Widely regarded as one of the best and most important Argentine actors of the 20th century. He worked in more than 50 movies since his first one, El amor nunca muere (Love Never Dies), in 1955, and received many recognitions for his work: among others, the Silver Condor, the Martin Fierro Award and the 1981 Diamond Konex Award. He died on April 11, 2014 at the age of 84. Alfredo Alc\u00f3n was born on March 3, 1930, in Liniers. His family has Spanish ancestry: his paternal grandmother immigrated from C\u00e1diz, and his mother from Castile. As a result, he had a fluent Spanish accent, which helped him when he worked in Spain. His father died soon after his birth, and so the family moved to Ciudadela, Buenos Aires. One of his early influences was Richard III by William Shakespeare, which he read at the age of 11. He began working as a radio host, announcing news from the Liniers market (the main market of livestock in Argentina). His first famous film was the 1955 Love Never Dies, starred by Mirtha Legrand. The film was directed by Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori.

He made his most successful films with the director Leopoldo Torre Nilsson. Un Guapo del '900 (1968) was followed by three historical films: Mart\u00edn Fierro (based in the poem Mart\u00edn Fierro) in 1968, El Santo de la Espada in 1970 (based in the life of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn), and G\u00fcemes: la tierra en armas in 1971 (based in the life of Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes).

Born November 10, 1919, in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, to Italian emigrant parents, Aldisert attended the local public schools. He graduated from Carnegie High School in 1937, then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1941 from the University of Pittsburgh. However, World War II interrupted his legal studies. He volunteered and joined the United States Marine Corps, serving as battery commander in the Pacific Theater (1942 to 1946) and attaining the rank of Major. He then finished his legal studies using the GI Bill, and received his Juris Doctor in 1947 from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. He married and raised a family, and also became active in the Italian Sons and Daughters of America, becoming the national president from 1954 to 1968. Aldisert had a private legal practice in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1947 to 1961, handling trials in civil and criminal matters. He re-entered government service by becoming a Judge of the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (from 1961 to 1968). From 1963 until his retirement from the federal bench in 1986, Aldisert also taught law as an adjunct professor at his alma mater. President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Aldisert to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated by Judge Austin Leander Staley. The United States Senate confirmed him on July 29, 1968, and Judge Aldisert received his commission that same day. In addition to his Third Circuit duties, Judge Aldisert served on the board of the Federal Judicial Center from 1972 to 1979. He served as Chief Judge of the Third Circuit, and as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1984 to 1986. Judge Aldisert assumed senior status on December 31, 1986, but remained active for nearly two more decades. His book on Opinion Writing was distributed to American judges at judicial conferences, and reached a second edition. In addition to sitting on many appellate panels after taking senior status, Judge Aldisert also traveled to England, Germany, Italy, the former Czechoslovakia, and to Poland in 1980 (when that nation began to rebel against communist rule) to lecture on American legal principles. Judge Aldisert stopped hearing cases in August 2014 after 46 years on the bench. He died following a heart attack on December 28, 2014 in Santa Barbara, California, and was survived by his widow, children and grandchildren. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Aldisert wrote a memoir and several books on jurisprudence and law practice, including The Judicial Process (West 2nd. ed. 1996), Logic for Lawyers: A Guide to Clear Legal Thinking (NITA 3rd ed. 1997), Winning on Appeal (NITA 2nd ed. 2003), Opinion Writing (West 2nd. ed. 2009) and A Judge's Advice: 50 Years on the Bench (CAP Press 2011). He also published a novel, Almost the Truth, (about the OSS and buried treasure). Judge Aldisert dissented in an ABSCAM sting case, in which a Philadelphia jury had convicted city councilmen of corruption, claiming that the FBI tactics resembled those in totalitaran Nazi Germany or Italy. Aldisert wrote a dissenting opinion in FAIR v. Rumsfeld, a high-profile case challenging the Solomon Amendment, a federal law denying federal funding to colleges and universities which prohibited on-campus recruiting by the military. The majority opinion enjoined enforcement of the law on First Amendment grounds (campuses had barred military recruiters based on the military's then \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy concerning sexual orientation). The United States Supreme Court ultimately vindicated Judge Aldisert's dissenting view which found the measures constitutional; Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the unanimous opinion in Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc. . In 2005 Judge Aldisert became the first recipient of the \"Distinguished Appellate Jurist Award\", bestowed by the American Bar Association's Council of Appellate Lawyers.

In 1979 he invented online shopping to enable online transaction processing between consumers and businesses, or between one business and another, a technique known later as e-commerce. In 1980 he invented the Teleputer, a multi-purpose home infotainment centre that was a fusion of PC, TV and Telecom networking technologies. In 1981 he developed the concept of interactive broadband local loop cable TV for mass market consumer telecommunications. Aldrich had a 38-year career in the IT industry, 20 years of which were spent as CEO of an international computer company, Redifon/Rediffusion/ROCC Computers. He retired as CEO in 2000 and became non-executive Chairman (2000-2014). He also worked for Honeywell (now Groupe Bull) and Burroughs Corporation (now Unisys). Aside from his inventions and innovations, he is known for his pro bono public service. He was an IT adviser to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 1981-86, IT adviser to the Confederation of British Industry January 1982-December 1983, President of the Institute of Information Scientists 1984-85, and Chairman of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations 1989-99. He has had a long, formal association with the University of Brighton in various capacities since 1982. Michael Aldrich was born on 22 August 1941 in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England. He went to school at Clapham College in London and, in 1959, he won a scholarship to the University of Hull to study History. He became engaged to Sandy Kay Hutchings, a student at Hull Art College, originally named Hull School of Art, in 1960, and they married in 1962, just prior to his graduation. They had four children and were grandparents to eight grandchildren. Aldrich spent 15 years with Honeywell and Burroughs in the UK in various sales and marketing roles, where he became known as an innovator, before joining the Board of Redifon in 1977. In 1979, Aldrich invented online shopping by connecting a modified domestic TV to a real-time transaction processing computer via a domestic telephone line. The intellectual basis for his system was his view that videotex, the modified domestic TV technology with a very simple menu-driven human\u2013computer interface, was a 'new, universally applicable, participative communication medium-the first since the invention of the telephone. ' This enabled 'closed' corporate information systems to be opened to 'outside' correspondents not just for transaction processing but also for messaging (e-mail) and information retrieval and dissemination (later known as e-business. ) His language of 'impacts competitive trading position', 'using IT for competitive advantage', 'externalises labour costs', etc. became commonplace in the management consultancy industry later in the 1980s. These ideas fed into the Business Process Reengineering strategies of the 1990s. His concept of information technology as a mass communications medium is a driver for the contemporary IT industry. His definition of the new mass communications medium as 'participative' (interactive, many-to-many) was fundamentally different to the traditional definitions of mass communication and mass media and a precursor to the social networking on the Internet 25 years later. In March 1980 he launched Redifon's Office Revolution. The Revolution was that corporate computer information systems had hitherto been in-house. From hereon consumers, customers, agents, distributors,suppliers and service companies would be connected on-line to the corporate systems and business would be transacted electronically in real-time. During the 1980s he designed, manufactured, sold, installed, maintained and supported many online shopping systems, using videotex technology. These systems which also provided voice response and handprint processing pre-date the Internet and the World Wide Web, the IBM PC, and Microsoft MS-DOS, and were installed mainly in the UK by large corporations. In 1980 he invented a system he called the 'Teleputer' by connecting a modified 14-inch colour television to a plinth containing a Zilog Z80 microprocessor running a modified version of the CP/M operating system and a chip set containing a modem, character generator and auto-dialler. The Teleputer of 1980's operate as a stand-alone colour PC (at a time when computer screens were mainly mono-chromatic), with a full complement of application software and network with other computers via dial-up or leased lines. The system included two 360 KB floppy disks (later a 20 MB Hard disk), a keyboard and a printer. The name 'Teleputer' later became synonymous with the fusion of computers, telecommunications and television in a single device. There were plans to add video-disks which at the time, in prototype form, were 12 inches. In many ways the Teleputer was the first home media centre concept. Although the Teleputer had been conceived for mass market home use, it was put into production for business use with the TV tuner removed. There was no consumer electronics market for it (at the time the consumer electronics market was just waking up to the VCR) but it was relatively easy to cost-justify the Teleputer for business networking. It was widely used in the UK and, because a Cyrillic version was made, in the then USSR. The Teleputer was often used with the Online Shopping systems. Most computer systems by their nature are transient but many of Aldrich's systems were transformative. A number were recorded for posterity and case studies have survived. The world's first recorded Business-to-Business (B2B) Online Shopping system was Thomson Holidays[1981] The world's first recorded Business-to-Consumer (B2C) online shopping system was Gateshead SIS/Tesco[1984] The world's first recorded online home shopper was Mrs Jane Snowball, 72, of Gateshead, England in May 1984. The Gateshead system had an Online Shopping Basket [later renamed Online Shopping Trolley] invented by Aldrich's colleague John Phelan. Some of the most interesting B2B applications in the surviving case studies were in the auto industry. Peugeot-Talbot (1981), then trading as Talbot Motors, installed a system for dealers to locate and adopt both a new car from the manufacturer or a used car from other dealers. Ford (1982) installed systems with ISPs in Brentwood England and Valencia Spain that permitted dealers in many European countries to buy new cars from Ford or transfer existing new cars from other dealers' lots. General Motors[1985] used systems for selling truck spares. The Nissan[1984] systems were truly revolutionary. They combined car purchase by the dealer from the manufacturer (known in the industry as 'adoption') with car sale and financing to the consumer. The Nissan systems networked credit ratings from outside agencies (mainly UAPT Infolink 1985) and finance provision from either Nissan or other suppliers in real-time as part of the complete consumer purchasing transaction. This is the world's first recorded B2C online shopping for high value consumer durables and a model for the complex internet-based online shopping transactions for consumer durables that followed 20 years later. The Nissan system was copied by other credit rating and finance companies at the time but these systems appear to have been supplied by Aldrich's company under confidentiality agreements and no record is extant. Aldrich's systems directly changed the holiday, retail, auto, finance and credit ratings industries. Online shopping was an important development for electronic commerce. E-commerce changed the way the world does business. Both of his B2C systems in Gateshead and Bradford were shopping and information services. Bradford Centrepoint [1987] even ran a news service at one point. These systems were pioneering pre-internet systems. Aldrich's original intention had been to develop a consumer electronics market for IT systems linked to a concept for broadband interactive information processing and cable TV distribution. He had a particular schema for a wired community. He campaigned successfully to change the law in the UK to permit new cable TV technology. Aldrich articulated and broadcast the ubiquitous business and social potential of his mass communications medium concept of IT and created systems to realise that dream, sold and installed them, and created satisfied clients. Well known in the 1980s in the UK, he was all but forgotten 20 years later. His ideas were copied, plagiarised and patented in the 1990s without acknowledgement. Thomson Holidays reverse-engineered his system (the sincerest form of homage in the computer business) and in the peer-reviewed 1988 report used his language while virtually air-brushing his contribution. For online shopping he produced both the system and the business rationale for using it. The tie between his online shopping systems and the innovative information systems he created is the concept that videotex was a new, mass communications medium. That was the giant conceptual leap from the world of EDP to modern IT, emancipating computing from corporate information centres, and a precursor to the development of the Apple Mac and Microsoft Windows approaches to universal human/computer interface design for PCs and the Apple iPhone 3G. The three areas of his work in consumer electronics\u2014online shopping/Teleworking/Telebanking, Home Information Centres and broadband cable TV\u2014and his book, papers and UK Government reports represent a significant contribution to the development of contemporary IT mass communications, consumer information and transaction systems, electronic commerce and e-business. Aldrich's ideas are the basis for Internet home shopping. In June 2011 an ICM Poll in the UK voted Aldrich's date of birth as the 7th most important date in the history of the internet. In April 2012 the UK Intellectual Property Office [formerly the UK Patents Office] nominated Aldrich for a public poll to identify the UK Visionary Innovator to celebrate World IP Day on 26 April. He came 4th in the Poll. He was also an innovator in other areas of computer and information technology including large-scale data capture, mixed media scanning, minicomputer networking, voice response and handprint processing. He patented the world's first static signature recognition system in 1984. He founded ROCC Computers in 1984 after a management buy-out of Rediffusion Computers. The company traded mainly in the UK and Eastern Europe. In the 20 years from 1978 to 1998, Michael Aldrich and his team undertook many high-profile projects which in many ways created the company's reputation. A number of case studies have survived. It was not unusual for the times that there were high-profile IT projects; what was unusual was that a small UK IT company of 500\u2013700 people became involved in high profile, high value, high risk and technically difficult projects. What is even more unusual is that there is no evidence to suggest that the projects were anything but very successful. The first project for which evidence survives was to provide a system to automatically read handprinted timesheets for the nationalised railway, British Rail with over 100,000 employees, to complete the weekly payroll. [1978]. Regional centres were established throughout the UK. Scanners were used to read timesheets and for other applications. The systems were used for many years. The largest project was the Siberian Gas Pipeline for Gazprom[1981-83] where 46 computer systems with 1200 terminals and 240 Teleputers were networked to provide logistics support for the operation of the pipeline. Every aspect of the project was fraught with difficulties, including political, technical, environmental, technical support, economic and resourcing problems. Some 1500 Russian hardware and software specialists were trained. The system was the most advanced IT system then installed in the USSR. It was used for many years. The largest European project was the Ford Europe system [1981-83] for dealers to locate and adopt a car, an online shopping system for dealers in the UK and much of Europe networking to systems based in the UK and Valencia, Spain. The system was used for nearly two decades. The largest UK project, apart from the Inland Revenue [the UK IRS], was the pricing of over 334 million medical prescriptions per annum for the Prescription Pricing Authority[1981-83][now NHS Prescription Services], part of the UK's single provider health system. These systems were used throughout the UK for a decade or more. The most politically sensitive project was probably the cattle passport system for the British Cattle Movement Service to address the BSE[mad cow disease] crisis in 1998. There were hundreds of other projects. The legacy of these projects is somewhat perverse. Leading-edge technology was seen to work well and to be reasonably easy to implement. It may have encouraged others to take risks that were not always justifiable. The 1990s onwards in the UK saw a succession of big, failed IT projects. Michael Aldrich became a Fellow of the British Computer Society in 1984 and he was made a Chartered Fellow in 2004. In 1986 he was invited to become a Companion of the Chartered Management Institute, the UK's elite management leadership organization. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals. In 2002 he was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Brighton for services to Information Technology. Michael Aldrich was invited to address an invited audience including British Royalty on 23 March 1983 in Edinburgh, Scotland to mark the 25th Anniversary of the founding of the British Computer Society. The speech was titled 'Computers in the Community. ' In 1987 Michael Aldrich was made a Freeman of the City of London,England. He became a Founder Member of the Company of Information Technologists which became a Chartered City Livery in 1992. The Company's membership consists of senior IT professionals. He is a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists. In 1981, at the beginning of the IT age, the British Government assembled a team of six UK IT experts, on a pro bono basis, to provide high-level advice to the government. This team was known as the Information Technology Advisory Panel. It reported to Prime Minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher and was located in the Cabinet Office adjacent to 10 Downing Street in London, England. In its five-year existence it produced three reports for publication by the government. Little else is known about its activities. Michael Aldrich was a member of the team for the whole term of its existence. He wrote a seminal paper on re-cabling the UK with local loop broadband cable and paying for it without government subsidy by distributing cable television alongside data and telephone services. The panel then wrote a report, published it and the government subsequently changed the law to legalise such systems. By 2007, 12 million UK homes were passed by these high-speed broadband links. The second report concerned the emerging software and information business and, among other issues, identified the potential power of providers who might control both content and electronic delivery. The third report was a long-range forecast of the potential effects of IT on schools and teaching and it predicted powerful PCs on school desks. The Panel was disbanded in 1986. Michael Aldrich became a member of the Council of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations[TIHR] in 1988 and was elected Chairman in 1989, a post he held for a decade. TIHR was then located at the Tavistock Clinic hospital in Hampstead, London, England. The TIHR was spun out of the Tavistock Clinic as a charity in 1947. The Tavistock Clinic is a centre of excellence for studying and addressing the clinical behaviour of individuals. The TIHR is focussed on group behaviour. In 1988 the TIHR had an illustrious history at the forefront of the social and psychological sciences but was somewhat in the shadows of the world-famous founding fathers who had once worked there or indeed were still working there. These people were approaching retirement and the TIHR needed to renew itself. The transition of the TIHR was to take nearly two decades. The 1989-99 period was characterised by the physical relocation of the TIHR from the Tavistock Clinic in Hampstead to its own building in London's City financial district; the stabilisation of the Institute's finances;the 50th Anniversary[1997] celebration that saluted the past achievements while embracing future challenges; the publication of the Tavistock Anthology which served to draw an elegant line under the TIHR's previous achievements; and the development of new lines of research by a talented younger team. Michael Aldrich left the Council in 1999. He remains a member of the Tavistock Association. Michael Aldrich first became involved with the then Brighton Polytechnic in 1977 when he was sponsoring student employees for degrees in electronic engineering and computer science. Under the sponsorship, employees were paid to attend college full-time for degrees. In 1982 he joined the governing body of the college, became Chairman and then Founding Chairman of the University of Brighton. In all he served 17 years on the governing body of the institution, 11 years as Chairman[1987-1998]. He retired from the Board of Governors in 1999. In 1990 he was responsible for appointing Professor [later Sir] David Watson as the first Vice-Chancellor[1990-2005]. A particularly talented leadership team developed the new university and for 1999 the University was declared 'University of the Year' by the London 'Sunday Times' newspaper. In 1992, Aldrich became Founding Chairman of the University's Foundation a fundraising body. The Aldrich family has been a longtime benefactor of the University. In 1995 Michael and wife Sandy began the Aldrich Collection of Contemporary Art which, by 2009, had grown to more than 300 works dating back over 100 years. The works have been created mainly by former students and artist professors at the University's highly rated Faculty of Art. The works are also held in web-accessible digitised form to provide a permanent virtual gallery. In 1996 the University named its new business, bio-sciences, engineering and technology library the 'Aldrich Library. ' In 2002 Aldrich relinquished the chairmanship of the Foundation and remained a Trustee. In 2008, Michael Aldrich agreed to donate his IT papers for the period 1977-2000, the Aldrich Archive, to the University for teaching, learning, scholarship and research. Much of the first part of the archive which relates to technology and events has been digitised and is web-accessible. The second phase of the archive project was launched in 2010. It will gather and digitise material relating to the people who built and used the systems. In November 2010 the University of Brighton Business School announced that it would be using the Aldrich Archive for teaching and research. A Michael Aldrich Prize would be awarded to the outstanding e-commerce student on merit each year. The first awards were made in the Summer of 2011. Aldrich died on 19 May 2014.

"}, {"text": "Richard John Aldridge (16 December 1945 \u2013 4 February 2014) was a British palaeontologist and academic, who was Bennett Professor of Geology at the University of Leicester. Aldridge's career began at Southampton University before moving to a temporary lectureship at University College London. He then joined the University of Nottingham where he remained until 1989, having reached the rank of Reader in Palaeontology. Following the Oxburgh Review of Earth Sciences, he moved to the University of Leicester. He served two terms as Head of Department, and was F. W. Bennett Professor of Geology from 2002 until he retired in 2011. Aldridge's research has been focused primarily on the conodont biostratigraphy and palaeobiology and one of his seminal contributions has been to uncover the vertebrate nature of the long-enigmatic conodont animal, principally in collaboration with Derek Briggs and Euan Clarkson. This was achieved through careful analysis of skeletal remains, but also through analysis of rare soft tissue remains of conodonts. This led naturally to Aldridge's later research focus which was fossil Lagerst\u00e4tten. Aldridge was awarded the Pander Medal of the Pander society in 2006. He was President of the Palaeontological Association and of the British Micropalaeontological Society (1995-1998). "}, {"text": "TaharQa Z. Aleem (born February 14, 1946 - present) and Tunde Ra Aleem (February 14, 1946 - August 14, 2014), were formerly known as Albert and Arthur Allen. Although they wore many hats, they are most notable for being American musicians, producers, authors, and entrepreneurs originally based out of Harlem, NY, in addition to being close friends and musical collaborators with Jimi Hendrix. They are also noted for starting NIA Records to launch their groundbreaking club/dance hits Hooked on Your Love and Release Yourself. This same independent record label would also be pivotal in kick-starting the careers of several legendary hip-hop artists, namely Marley Marl and the Wu-Tang Clan. . After the death of his twin Tunde Ra in 2014, TaharQa still continues to be active in humanitarian efforts through his Hip-Hop for Humanity organization. TaharQa (Albert Raymond Allen) and Tunde Ra (Arthur Russell Allen) Aleem were born in Harlem New York on February 14, 1946 to William Austin Allen and Dorothy Phoenix album. The two twins were inseparable growing up and got a first-class musical education on the streets of Harlem, namely the world-famous Apollo theater. Those rich cultural experiences of seeing the world's greatest R&B/soul acts along with the musical talents of their mother Dorothy, propelled the Allen twins to pursue music in various singing groups. It was one of Harlem's most notorious gangsters and entrepreneurs, Jack \"Fat Man\" Taylor, who gave the twins their first break, as he signed their group, the International GTO's to his independent record label, Rojac Records. The GTO's never made it big on Rojac Records, but they had the opportunity to learn how to run an independent record label. This on the job training would prove to be most valuable later in life. During their time at Rojac Records, the twins had the opportunity to rub elbows with talented and creative people like Clarence \u201cBlowfly\u201d Reid, who was an in-house writer and producer for Rojac Records. It was also through Fat Man that the twins would meet Lithofayne (Faye) Pridgeon, a close friend and love interest of Jimi Hendrix. Originally, it was Faye's intention to use Arthur (Tunde Ra) to evict Jimi Hendrix from the apartment of her friend June Vasquenza (Maria Gurrero/Pantera) by convincing Arthur to marry June to rectify her status as an illegal alien from Mexico. Instead of kicking Jimi out, the twins bonded immediately with him over their shared passion of music. The Allen twins became lifelong friends with Jimi for the duration of his life, both before and after his rise to the top of the music world, even recording with him several times. The twins befriended Jimi Hendrix before he went to Europe and became a superstar. To keep himself grounded, Jimi always made it his business to stay connected with his friends from Harlem upon his return to the States, even as one of rock's largest luminaries. Jimi's friendship with the twins, would eventually lead to musical collaborations. The twins, musically known as the Ghetto Fighters (a name suggested by Hendrix), would record background vocals on Jimi's songs like Dolly Dagger, Freedom, Stepping Stone and Izabella. Jimi also lent his progressive electric guitar skills to a song the twins recorded in June 1969 at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama called Mojo Man. Jimi overdubbed his guitar parts later in August 1970 at Electric Lady Studios. This was all part of a larger plan for Jimi to help the twins produce the Ghetto Fighters album, which he called a \u201cstreet opera. \u201dThe twins were featured as background vocalists on at least four (not counting compilations and reissues) Jimi Hendrix posthumous albums: Cry of Love (1971 - Platinum), Rainbow Bridge (1971 - Gold), War Heroes (1972), First Rays of the New Rising Sun (1997), and People, Hell and Angels (2013). They were also featured on Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix (1997 - Double Platinum), The Jimi Hendrix Experience (Purple Box Set) (2000 - Platinum), and Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection (2001 - Gold). The twins wanted to promote a Harlem concert to showcase Jimi to the Black community. Jimi in turn, wanted to show his appreciation to the genesis of his New York musical roots. The original plan was for Jimi to do the benefit concert for the humanitarian crisis in Biafra (Nigeria) at the Apollo, but the owner, George Schiffman declined the offer. Instead, plans were made to perform an outdoor benefit concert for the United Block Association (UBA) on the corner of Lenox Avenue and 139th St. Before the concert took place on September 5th, 1969, Jimi made the big announcement at a September 3rd televised press conference at Frank's Restaurant in Harlem. Unfortunately, most of the reporters were more interested in asking questions about his legendary performance at Woodstock, which occurred less than a month earlier in August. The benefit concert was supported by artists on Fat Man's Rojac Records. Artists like Big Maybelle, Chuck-a-Luck, and LTD, with a young Jeffrey Osborne on drums, warmed the Harlem crowd up for the big finale of Jimi Hendrix, Billy Cox, Jerry Velez, Mitch Mitchell, and Larry Lee. This was the same lineup that Jimi used at Woodstock, called Gypsy, Sun and Rainbows. The concert was set to be filmed professionally, but the person that was paid to film the concert didn't realize how big of a star Jimi was and ran out of film in the process of recording the other acts. This left only a few seconds of film before Jimi began his set. All that remains of that historic night are seconds of a video of Jimi plugging into his amps, pictures taken by few professional photographers, and a horrible distorted audio recording that's barely audible. By most eyewitness accounts, the Harlem crowd was slow to warm up to Jimi, with someone even throwing an object on stage. Once Jimi got into his performance, he won the crowd over and put on a great show. In 1972, with their friend Jimi Hendrix deceased, the Ghetto Fighters changed their musical group's name to US, then Prana People. The group consisted of the twins, their sister Juliette and Tommy Lockhart. They were managed and financed by New York Knicks legend Earl \u201cThe Pearl\u201d Monroe. The group released a self-titled album on Prelude Records in 1977 After the Prana People album, the twins decided to go in a new musical direction when they utilized electronic MIDI technology along with a LINN 9000 drum machine to produce the song Hooked on Your Love in 1979. The song featured Leroy Burgess on lead vocals, formerly of the R&B group Black Ivory. Rounding out the background vocals were Jocelyn Brown, Crystal Davis, and a young Luther Vandross. The song would go on to become a club classic and usher in the early transitional phase from disco to club/dance music in NYC. The song would peak at #15 and spend 16 weeks on Billboard's Dance charts. At this point, the twins had grown weary of the traditional \u201cshop your demo\u201d approach and opted to go the independent route. They borrowed 1500 dollars from their father, pressed their own records and started NIA Records in 1979 in order to distribute their single. Author Dan Charnas recalls the early business of rap in his book, The Big Payback. The Aleems and Nia Records play a prominent role, as they were responsible for some of rap's seminal MC's. The twins were starting to get hip to the young fledgling hip-hop scene due to the prodding of Fat Man, whose Harlem World club became a rite of passage for many up and coming hip-hop artists. The Sugar Hill Gang was discovered at Harlem World by Joe and Sylvia Robinson of Sugar Hill Records. Fat Man also suggested that the twins take their instrumental for their club hit Hooked on Your Love and use it as a backing track for a group called Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde (Andre Harrell and Alonzo Brown). The demo resulted in a production deal for the Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde with Profile Records. The twins\u2019 next single on NIA Records, Release Yourself, was an even bigger hit than their first single, thanks to the hip-hop styled remix by Marley Marl in 1984. The suggestion of this remix was made by Mr. Magic, whose WBLS show, Mr. Magic's Rap Attack, was just beginning to take NY urban radio into its hip-hop era. NIA records would also distribute songs from Captain Rock, The Last Poet (Abiodun Oyewole), Sparky D\u2019s answer record to Roxanne (Sparky\u2019s Turn), Marley Marl featuring MC Shan on Marley Marl\u2019s Scratch, and the Super Kids featuring a young Craig G, Prince A. D. , and Tragedy Khadafi (The Intelligent Hoodlum). The Aleems continued to put out hot dance hits on 12-inch singles like 1985's Confusion and its subsequent remix in 1986, both featured vocals from Black Ivory lead vocalist, Leroy Burgess. The hot streak of The Fantastic Aleems and NIA Records caught the eye of Atlantic Records and they offered the twins a recording deal. This prompted a name change to Aleem. While working on their debut Top 50 R&B 1986 album for Atlantic called Casually Formal, they contracted the services of Maurice Starr, which would prove to be a fruitful relationship when his new group, New Kids on the Block suddenly took off like his former group New Edition did. Maurice allowed the twins to produce and write a song on the New Kids\u2019 fourth album, Step by Step entitled, Never Gonna Fall in Love Again. The album went triple platinum in the US and sold over 7 million copies worldwide. The twins would go on to produce one more album for Atlantic in 1987 called Shock. Both Atlantic albums would feature Leroy Burgess on lead vocals. During the 90s, the twins would step back from recording as artists and now decided to open Konkrete Recording Studios in Mid-town Manhattan and also started B. I. D. (Black Independent Distribution), to promote and distribute records. This allowed them the chance to work with an array of talented artists like Rick James, Kashif, Technotronic, and the Wu-Tang Clan. The twins helped the Wu-Tang Clan distribute their first single Protect Ya Neck in New York and helped them get signed to LOUD Records. In addition, the twins also recorded some of the songs that would appear on Wu-Tang's classic debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) at Konkrete Studios. This collaboration would also lead to the twins working with the Gravediggaz, which featured Prince Paul, Frukwan, Poetic, and Wu-Tang Clan front man and producer RZA. The twins founded the ROBC (The Reconstruction of Black Civilization), which was designed to bring attention to the royalty that exists in people of African heritage. To demonstrate their mission, the organization sponsored a trip to the U. S. for the son of Emperor Halie Selassie I of Ethiopia, along with several members of the Ethiopian Royal Family. The twins also founded Hip-Hop for Humanity on September 11th, 2001. The goal of HHFH is to assist musically inclined youth by educating them to embrace leadership roles, take responsibility as future leaders, and put this knowledge to use by engaging in positive actions in their community and the world. The Aleems have also served as advisers and directors of the Hendrix Foundation. Before their friend Jimi Hendrix died, he was planning on working with the twins on their Ghetto Fighter album. The songs Mojo Man and Jet Set were intended to be on that album. When Jimi died on Sept. 18th, 1970, the twins shelved this album for over 40 years. They finally resurrected it and polished up the song Mojo Man with additional vocals from Leroy Burgess. The original version of Mojo Man appeared on a posthumous Hendrix album called People, Hell and Angels in 2013. To go along with the twins\u2019 version of Mojo Man, they included an animated cartoon as a part of their Urban Street Tales series. The twins opened up their vault and began to make their past catalog available to the public, including a song called Sugar Daddy, featuring James Booker on piano, Buddy Miles on vocals and Jimi Hendrix on guitar. The Allen brothers wrote the song Mojo Man\" for the posthumous Jimi Hendrix album \"People, Hell and Angels. \" In addition to their musical catalog, the twins have also authored several books, including a memoir about their lives originally published in 2014. This auto-biography, Jimi Hendrix & The Ghetto Fighters: In Harlem World, traces the path of the twins from Harlem hustlers, to befriending Hendrix, to musical pioneers, to respected elders. The book is very candid in the portrayal of the many flaws and personal demons that plagued the twins throughout their lives. Other books include: The 66 Attributes of the Nigger, Sacred Formulas \u2013 To raise the Royal Mind and the soon to be released musical-mythology, Jimi Hendrix and the World of the Mu. The Aleems, known then as the Allen twins stole the show in the 1973 documentary about Jimi Hendrix (a film about Jimi Hendrix). Their memorable interviews shed light on what it was like to be friends with one of the greatest musical talents the world has ever known The Aleems were also featured as actors. As they played themselves in the 1994 comedy, Twin Sitters, starring the Barbarian Brothers (Peter and David Paul). The Aleems were also involved in two film soundtracks - 1988's I'm Gonna Git You Sucka: Two Can Play the Game (producers\u2019 credit) and 1994's Twin Sitters: Watcha Lookin' At (writers\u2019 and producers\u2019 credit) On August 14th, 2014, Tunde Ra Aleem ended his physical existence on earth, as he finally succumbed to his lengthy bout with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a rare and terminal disease that affects the lungs\u2019 bronchi, preventing oxygen from being absorbed. Defying the original prognosis in 2006, which only gave Tunde Ra 3-4 months to live, he was able to live eight more productive and lively years. During this time, he completed three books and three albums. The Aleems will always be remembered as not only friends of Jimi Hendrix, pre-fame/post-fame, but also as life-long hustlers, who made pioneering moves in the independent record business and early club/dance and hip-hop music. Their entrepreneurial spirit pre-dated the Too Short, Master P, Cash Money and hip-hop independent record label CEO era, which saw hip-hop artists control their own destiny by moving units themselves. The Aleems were privileged to witness the early beginnings of hip-hop when Jimi Hendrix, Lightnin\u2019 Rod and Buddy Miles combined to produce the proto-rap masterpiece, Doriella Du Fontaine in 1969. They parlayed these experiences and life lessons into a successful musical career that spanned two decades. Not only did they break new ground in club/dance music, but they also were involved in bridging the gap between hip-hop and R&B (Marley Marl re-mix of Release Yourself) and sponsoring, nurturing, and recording the up-and-coming rap artists of the '80s and '90s. In 2016, the Aleems had to sue Experience Hendrix L. L.

Alexie was born in Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories and lived in Inuvik. He served as Tribal chief of the Tetlit Gwich'in of Fort McPherson and also served as the vice president of the Gwich'in Tribal Council for two terms, helping achieve a land claims agreement. He was elected as President of the Gwich'in Tribal Council in July 2012. Alexie attended Chief Julius School (n\u00e9 Peter Warren Dease School) in Fort McPherson but completed his high school education in 1974 at Samuel Hearne Secondary School in Inuvik. In 1984 Alexie completed a two-year public business and administration program at Thebacha College in Fort Smith. Alexie served as band manager of the Tetlit Gwich'in Band Council and was elected Tribal chief of the Tetlit Gwich'in of Fort McPherson in 1989 and served two year. He also served as the vice president of the Gwich'in Tribal Council for two terms and was elected as President of the Gwich'in Tribal Council in July 2012. In 1990, Alexie led the Gwich'in delegation at a Territories-wide meeting of Dene and Met\u00eds groups working on a comprehensive land claim agreement between these groups and the government of Canada. When it became clear that other groups at the delegation were not ready to accept the negotiating position taken by the Gwich'in, Alexie led a walkout of the Gwich'in delegation. Alexie then became the Chief Negotiator for the Gwich'in Tribal Council as they pursued their own land claim agreement with the Government of Canada, which led to the signing in April, 1992 of the Gwich'in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement. Signed in April 1992 the Gwich'in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement provided the Gwich'in with the following rights: Ownership of approximately 22,330 square kilometres of land in the Northwest Territories, and 1,554 square kilometres in the Yukon. Subsurface (mineral) rights to 6,158 square kilometres of land in the Northwest Territories. A tax-free payment of $75 million paid over a 15-year period, a share of resource revenues from development in the Northwest Territories, and a 15-year subsidy of property taxes on certain Gwich\u2019in municipal lands. Participation in land use planning and management of renewable resources, land, water, and Gwich\u2019in heritage resources. Exclusive rights to be licensed to conduct commercial wildlife activities on Gwich\u2019in lands and preferential rights in the whole settlement area. Negotiation of self-government. In 2002 Alexie was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee Medal for exemplary contribution to his community and to Canada. His first novel, Porcupines and China Dolls (published in 2002 and reissued by Theytus Books in paperback in 2009 ) examines the lives of students forced into the Canadian Indian residential school system [2] and the ensuing intergenerational or Historical trauma for them and their families. As reviewer Jim Bartley wrote in The Globe and Mail, \"On a September day in 1962, we enter the school (now \"hostel\") with two boys, James and Jake. For the first time in their lives, they will live without family around them, captive to strange, cold adults, a militarized sense of time and no appeal for the wrongs done them. \" Bartley adds, \"[Alexie's] evocation of chronic mental anguish has a cumulative power that transcends his sentimental excess. Though the abuser is brought to justice here, the pain lives on in ever more elusive ways. Alexie offers no easy outs. Thomas King explains the novel's title in The Truth About Stories: A Native Narrative: \"the girls had been scrubbed and powdered to look like china dolls and the boys had been scrubbed and sheared to look like porcupines\" One of the lines from which the title draws its name comes from Alexie writing, \"No one heard the little china doll that night, but if she were given a voice, it would've sounded like a million porcupines screaming in the dark. \"Author of The Lesser Blessed, Richard Van Camp's review of Porcupines and China Dolls suggests, \"[t]his book will initiate more healing than any of us will ever know. It's hard but good medicine. \"King also indicates that Alexie\u2014alongside Eden Robinson, Harry Robinson and Ruby Slipperjack\u2014 creates \"fictions. . . primarily for a Native audience, making a conscious decision not so much to ignore non-Native readers as to write for the very people they write about\", suggesting that the text does not provide enough of a debriefing for a non-Native audience to understand its weight historically. CBC Radio host Shelagh Rogers wrote, \"Dramatic, raw, merciless, Porcupines and China Dolls is not a book you coast through. It is about our history and what happened to 'The People', as Alexie writes, when the Europeans arrived. \" Alexie's sophomore novel, The Pale Indian (published in 2005), offers perhaps an even less clear historical debriefing than its predecessor, confirming King's suspicions about intended audience. The Pale Indian takes place in the 1980s and surround's a young man's return to his northern community after being raised in Calgary by an adoptive white family. The novel is both a love story and a tragedy. The Pale Indian is full of energetic sex and humour that provide respite from some of the more serious issues that the novel confronts. \u2022 Porcupines and China Dolls (2002), ISBN 978-1-894778-72-5 \u2022 The Pale Indian (2005), ISBN 978-0-14-301553-6 "}, {"text": "Alhaji Roland Issifu Alhassan (September 15, 1935 \u2013 April 14, 2014) was a Ghanaian politician, lawyer and diplomat.

He also played 39 Test matches for England. Allen was first selected for England in 1959 and in 1960 was selected as the Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year. Allen toured all the then-current Test-playing nations. He was a decent bat, his Test average higher than the all-rounders Fred Titmus and Ray Illingworth, and in the 1963 Lord's Test against the West Indies, he notably played out the final two balls of Wes Hall's last over for a draw. Allen had protected Colin Cowdrey at the other end, who was pressed in to bat with his broken arm in plaster. In the 1965\u201366 Ashes series Allen made 50 not out in the Third Test at Sydney, adding 93 for the last two wickets and took 4/47 as England won by an innings and 93 runs. Allen was also famous for being taken off against Australia. In the decisive Fourth Test at Old Trafford in 1961 he took three quick wickets to have Australia nine wickets down, but Alan Davidson hit him for 20 runs in an over and Peter May took him off. Davidson added 98 for the last wicket and Australia won by 54 runs. Nevertheless, in six winters, Allen completed the set of playing against all the other Test playing nations of the time. In India and Pakistan in 1961\u201362, he bowled 482 overs in the Test series alone. A right-arm off-break bowler, using a very short run, Allen came close to developing into an all-rounder on the level of Fred Titmus. Playing fairly regularly for England throughout the first half of the 1960s, after 1966 he found it increasingly difficult to score enough runs or get enough bowling at county level as trends changed. Gloucestershire used three spin bowlers from the 1950s onwards but by the end of the 1960s Mike Bissex and Allen were effectively doing the work of one bowler. Though Bissex lost form, the advent of Sadiq Mohammad, a useful leg spinner, saw Allen fade away from the county side in 1972. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman noted that \"towards the end of his 20 summers at Bristol his relationship with skipper Tony Brown, with whom he had grown up on a cricket field, became strained. Allen even found himself left out of his own benefit match\". In later years, Allen was a member of the Gloucestershire County Cricket Club committee, and was elected club president in 2011.

He spent most of the 1954\u201355 season in the Western Hockey League with the Edmonton Flyers\u2014Detroit's farm team, whose roster included future Hockey Hall of Fame inductees Johnny Bucyk, Norm Ullman, Glenn Hall, Al Arbour, and player-coach Bud Poile. He then played one season with the Brandon Regals before being hired by the Seattle Americans as player-head coach in 1956. He retired as a player in 1957 to become a full-time coach. From 1956 to 1965, Allen was a head coach in the Western Hockey League with the Seattle Americans/Seattle Totems, with only one losing season in eight years. With the NHL expansion in 1967, Allen was hired as the first head coach of the Philadelphia Flyers, with his former coach and teammate Bud Poile as general manager. In their inaugural season, the Flyers finished first in their division with the best record among the six new teams. They fell to third place in their division in the 1968\u201369 NHL season, and Allen then became the Flyers' general manager while serving in the same capacity with the Quebec Aces at the same time. There, he would help construct the famed \"Broad Street Bullies\" that led the Flyers to consecutive Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. He would also help start the AHL's Maine Mariners, one of the most successful franchises in that league's history. Allen was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a Builder in 1992. He was the executive vice-president of the Flyers. Keith Allen was married to Joyce Webster for 65 years. Together they have a daughter, Traci, and two sons, Brad and Blake. Relocating from Seattle in the 1960s, he and his wife Joyce settled in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Due to developing dementia in his later years, Allen lived in the care of an assisted living community, along with wife Joyce, in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. He died on Tuesday, February 4, 2014. He was 90 years old.

Along with Dr. Philip Ashmore, Dr. W. G. (Bill) Trapp and Dr. Ross Robertson, he performed the first Open Heart Surgery in British Columbia on 29 October 1957 at Vancouver General Hospital, by closing an Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) in 9 year old John Evans, using Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB). Allen grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1946, he obtained a MD from the University of Toronto. In 1953, he received a Fellowship in general surgery from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and, in 1964, a Fellowship in thoracic surgery from the same institution. His post graduate training included one year of internal medicine at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands followed by 4 1/2 years at the University of Toronto in the general surgery program at the Hospital for Sick Children and the Toronto General Hospital. Returning to Vancouver, between early 1954 to mid-1956, he developed a practice in general surgery. During that period he held a research position at the British Columbia Research Institute under the direction of Dr. Kenneth Evelyn. The project tested the feasibility of replacing a diseased abdominal aorta with a mesh supported vena cava autograft In mid 1956 he began a year of training in Cardiac surgery with C. Walton Lillehei, the originator of Open-heart surgery, at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. In early 1957, he participated in the operation where the world\u2019s first artificial cardiac pacemaker was employed by Lillehei. In mid 1957 Allen returned to Vancouver and formed a cardiac team with surgeon, Philip Ashmore, anaesthetist William Dodds and paediatrician Morris Young. On October 29, 1957, at the Vancouver General Hospital, the team successfully performed the first open heart operation in British Columbia. He also performed the first Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery in Cardiff, Wales In 1977 to 1980 Allen was invited to establish a cardiac surgical certre at the Kasturba General Hospital, Bhopal, India. The Indian surgeon, Dr. Raj Bisaryia, who had trained in Vancouver continued the program between Dr. Allen\u2019s visits. In 1987 and 1989 Allen was the visiting cardiac surgeon at the Ibn-al;Bitar Hospital in Baghdad, Iraq. The Hospital was built and staffed by the Irish construction company, PARC. The doctors, nurses and technicians were Irish, the only Iraqis were the patients and interpreters. Many patients lived in remote areas with minimal access to medical care. Consequently, most of the cardiac valve replacements used bioprosthetic {porcine tissue ]that required no anticoagulant therapy post operative, compared to the mechanical artificial valve that did require anticoagulents. 1990 to 1999 Allen was a chairman of medical review panels of the British Columbia Worker\u2019s Compensation Board; he chaired 275 Panels. From 1972 to 1988 he established the annual Peter Allen Surgical Essay Award, open to senior cardio-thoracic trainees in the United Kingdom. In 1993, after 36 years of surgical practice, he retired as an Emeritus Clinical Professor of Surgery at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine. In 1995 he moved to Oakville, Ontario and joined the Medical Clinic of Dr. Sapra and Dr. Khanna as a consultant in peripheral vascular disease, until retirement in 2006. He died on November 17, 2014. 1956 - Annual research prize of the British Columbia Surgical Society for work on the diseased abdominal aorta. 1957 - McLaughlin Fellowship to study cardiac surgery under Dr. Lillehei in Minneapolis. 1964 - Nuffield Travelling Fellowship to further study cardiac surgery at the Brompton Hospital in London and the Sulley Chest Hospital in Cardiff, Wales. 1972 - Invitation to address the Society of Thoracic and Cardiac Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. 1978 - Vancouver Medical Association annual Osler Address. 1980 - Invitation to join the Pete\u2019s Club composed of United Kingdom and Western European cardiac surgeons.

Born and raised in Connah's Quay, Flintshire Vic Allen left school at fifteen with no qualifications and became an apprentice bricklayer. He worked as a bricklayer before and after service in the RAF in World War II. During this time, he became an accomplished amateur boxer competing at a national level. While working as a bricklayer, he began to be educated in Marxism and socialism by fellow workers who lent him books. He became more politicised after being sacked from a site for joining a trade union. Allen went up to the London School of Economics in 1946 and gained a BSc in Economics in 1949 followed by a PhD. His PhD thesis was published in 1954 as \"Power in Trade Unions\". Allen was appointed a Lecturer in Industrial Relations in the School of Economic Studies at the University of Leeds in 1959, becoming a Senior Lecturer in 1963, Reader in 1970 and Professor of the Sociology of Industrial Society in 1973. He retired from Leeds in 1988 with the title Emeritus Professor. Allen was the official historian of the British National Union of Mineworkers, a confidante of Arthur Scargill, Ken Gill and Mick McGahey and an adviser to British trade unionists for over 40 years.

Clark completed his primary schooling in Kenya, completed his higher education in South Africa, and obtained a BSc in Medical Science from the University of the Witwatersrand in 1947. He earned his PhD from the University of Oxford in 1950. After working at the Radcliffe Infirmary for two years, he worked as post-doctoral student to Linus Pauling in 1954. After teaching medicine for three years at Oxford, he worked at the Medical Research Council in London. In 1978 he simultaneously worked at the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) as its Director, and at the World Health Organization's (WHO) Immunology Laboratory, both in Nairobi. He later became the Vice President for Research at Syntex Corporation (1981-1994). While a graduate student at Oxford, Allison joined a vocational Oxford University Expedition to Mount Kenya in 1949. He first noticed from blood samples he collected that there was an unusually high occurrence of sickle-cell trait in its less harmful (heterozygous) condition. He conceived the idea that it could be an advantageous adaptation to people constantly exposed to malaria. After he completed his doctoral research at Oxford in 1953, he investigated further. In 1954 he discovered, confirming his preconception, that people with sickle-cell trait are resistant to the deadly falciparum malaria. In the 1970s, Allison had worked out the enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, as a key molecule of the immune response in autoimmune diseases and in organ transplantation. Based on this, he tested the otherwise abandoned antibiotic, mycophenolate mofetil, as an inhibitor of the enzyme. After experimental success, with his wife, Elsie M. Eugui, he developed a safer derivative which was eventually approved as an immunosuppressive drug called CellCept. He contributed more that 400 technical papers and edited 12 books. Allison was born in East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa. His father was a World War I British veteran and keen polo player, who left Britain in 1919 for better farming life in East Africa. His father had a chrysanthemum farm at Mawingo in upper Gilgil, Kenya, overlooking the Great Rift Valley, where he spent most of his childhood. He entered boarding school for his primary education. He returned to South Africa for higher education and obtained his BSc in Medical Science at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. In 1947 he entered Merton College, Oxford, from where he earned his DPhil with medical degree in 1952. He then found employment at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, where he worked for two years till 1954. However, most of his 1953 work was in Kenya. Receiving the George Herbert Hunt Travelling Scholarship for 1953, he joined the Nobel laureate Linus Pauling at the California Institute of Technology for post-doctoral research in 1954. He returned to England to take up teaching in medicine at University of Oxford. After three years in Oxford he was employed in the Medical Research Council in London, where he worked for twenty years. He first joined the MRC National Institute for Medical Research, and then the Clinical Research Centre. In 1978 he was appointed as Director of the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) in Nairobi, Kenya. He simultaneously worked at the World Health Organization's (WHO) Immunology Laboratory in Nairobi. In 1981, he became the Vice President for Research at Syntex Corporation at Palo Alto, California. As Syntex was acquired by Hoffman LaRoche in 1994, he was given retirement. He continued to teach human genetics at Stanford University and participated in many therapeutic programmes at Alavita Pharmaceuticals. He spent his last 30 years at his home in Belmont, California. He died on 20 February 2014 as a result of complications of the end stage of pulmonary fibrosis, which he had been suffering from. He was survived by his second wife, and two sons. Allison developed an early interest in human evolution. Growing up in Kenya, he made close contact with paleoanthropologists such as Louis Leakey, who made important fossil discoveries at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. One of his teachers at University of the Witwatersrand was Raymond Dart, the discoverer of an extinct hominid Australopithecus africanus. He was strongly influenced by Charles Darwin's books, On the Origin of Species and The Descent of Man, while still a teenager. As he put it, he \"became a convinced Darwinian. \"Allison married Helen Green (7 February 1923 \u2013 26 December 2011) while teaching at Oxford. After they had two sons, Miles and Joseph Mark, they soon divorced. By then Allison met an Argentinian biochemist, Elsie Eugui, a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the Clinical Research Centre. Allison found true partnership in profession as well as interest in Eugui, and married her. They were together for the rest of his life. They shared their passion in music, art, deep-sea fishing, hiking, bird-watching, and wine tasting. In 1949 Allison participated in a vocational Oxford University Expedition to Mount Kenya. He took up the task of collecting blood samples from Kenyans for analyses of blood groups and genetic markers such as for sickle-cell disease. At the time it was a scientific puzzle that the disease was prevalent even though it killed people before they reached puberty, before they can have children to pass on the lethal gene. He found that the prevalence of sickle-cell trait (heterozygous condition) among people inhabiting coastal areas was higher than 20%. (At the time the highest record was 8% among African-Americans. ) He was posed with the question as to why such a deadly disease (in homozygous condition) would be more prevalent in a localised area in the form of a less lethal heterozygous form. He formulated a hypothesis that it was because it had selective advantage towards malaria. Because the region was malaria endemic, acquiring a genetic mutation, but not the lethal form, could confer resistance to Plasmodium falciparum. To test his hypothesis he had to wait four years until he completed his medical course. He returned to Nairobi in 1953 to start his experiments. He selected volunteers of the Luo people, who came from malaria hyperendemic area around Lake Victoria. Under experimental infection, volunteers indicated partial resistance to malaria. Then he found children naturally infected with malaria in Buganda. He discovered that children with heterozygous trait had significantly low number of parasites in their blood. This implies further that heterozygosity in children acquired better survival rate against malaria. His final results reported in 1954 from nearly 5,000 East Africans indicated the overall picture: sickle-cell trait confers resistance to malaria. When Allison introduced the genetic theory of malaria resistance, it was largely received with scepticism. The reason was there were observations that malaria was equally found among homozygote and heterozygote patients in some East Africans. Further it was experimentally demonstrated that malaria could be induced in African-Americans having heterozygous alleles. But Allison argued that if selective pressure would operate children between six months and four years of age are most important for population study because survival is most critical to reach reproductive stage among these children. His arguments were proved right by subsequent studies among children of East, Central, and West Africa, showing 90% protection from malaria among children with heterozygous allele. In the 1970s while working at the Medical Research Council, Allison had investigated the biochemical cause of immune deficiency in children. He discovered the metabolic pathway involving an enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for undesirable immune response in autoimmune diseases, as well as for immune rejection in organ transplantation. He developed an idea that if a molecule that could block the enzyme is discovered, then, it would become an immunosuppressive drug for autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation. In 1981 he decided to go for drug discovery and approached several pharmaceutical companies, which turned him down one by one as he had no primary knowledge on drug research. However, Syntex liked his plans and asked him to join the company with his wife. He became Vice President for Research. In one of their experiments the Allisons used an antibacterial compound, mycophenolate mofetil, which was abandoned in clinical use due to its adverse effects. They discovered that the compound had immunosuppressive activity. They synthesised a chemical variant for increased activity and reduced adverse effects. They subsequently demonstrated that it was useful in organ transplantation in experimental rats. After successful clinical trials, the compound was approved for use in kidney transplant by the US Food and Drug Administration on 3 May 1995, and was commercialised under the brand name CellCept. In 1982 Allison and Eugui reported in the Christmas issue of The Lancet the discovery of immunity to malarial parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) by production of free oxygen radicals in the immune system. A quick response came from Ian Clark, former PhD student of Allison, and W. B. Cowden and G. A. Butcher, both of the University of Newcastle Medical School in New South Wales, who claimed that the scientific ideas were originally theirs, and accused Allison of stealing the idea. Clark further stated that he had developed the concept back in the spring of 1982, and submitted his report to Nature, which rejected it because it was considered \"out-of-purview\" of the journal. Clark eventually published his work in the January issue of Infection and Immunity. In August 1982, Clark had given Allison a draft copy of his manuscript; Allison's own experimental result was published in December. Reacting to the accusation, Allison explained that his experiment was independent of Clark's, and returned the accusation that while Clark was his student, he had claimed two works as his own, which were not. It was generally agreed that the original idea was that of Clark's. A reconciliation paper was published in February 1983, jointly written by all the scientists involved.

The family migrated to Mandatory Palestine when she was a child, and Aloni grew up in Tel Aviv. She was sent to boarding school during World War II while her parents served in the British Army. As a youth she was a member of the socialist Zionist Hashomer Hatzair youth movement and the Palmach. During the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, she was involved in military struggles for the Old City of Jerusalem and was captured by Jordanian forces. Following the establishment of the state of Israel, she worked with child refugees and helped establish a school for immigrant children. She taught in a school while studying law. After her marriage in 1952 to Reuven Aloni, the founder of Israel Lands Administration, she moved to Kfar Shmaryahu. Aloni joined Mapai in 1959. She also worked as an attorney and hosted a radio show Outside Working Hours that dealt with human rights and women's rights. She also wrote columns for several newspapers. In 1965, Aloni was elected to the Knesset on the list of the Alignment, an alliance of Mapai and Ahdut HaAvoda, and subsequently founded the Israel Consumers Council, which she chaired for four years. She left the Alignment in 1973 and established the Citizens Rights Movement, which became known as Ratz. The party advocated electoral reform, separation of religion and state and human rights and won three seats in the 1973 Knesset elections. Ratz initially joined the Alignment-led government with Aloni as Minister without Portfolio but she resigned immediately in protest at the appointment of Yitzhak Rafael as Minister of Religions. Ratz briefly became Ya'ad \u2013 Civil Rights Movement when independent MK Aryeh Eliav joined the party, but returned to its original status soon after. Throughout the 1970s Aloni attempted to create a dialogue with Palestinians in hopes of achieving a lasting peace settlement. During the 1982 Lebanon War she established the International Center for Peace in the Middle East. In the run-up to the 1984 elections, Ratz aligned with Peace Now and the Left Camp of Israel to increase its size in the Knesset to five seats. In 1992, she led Ratz into an alliance with Shinui and Mapam to form the new Meretz party, which won 12 seats under her leadership in the elections that year. Aloni became Minister of Education under Yitzhak Rabin but was forced to resign after a year due to her outspoken statements on matters of religion. As Education Minister, she also criticized organized tours by Israeli high school pupils to Holocaust concentration camps on grounds that such visits were turning Israeli youth into aggressive, nationalistic xenophobes, claiming that students \"march with unfurled flags, as if they've come to conquer Poland\". She was reappointed Minister of Communications and Science and Culture and served until 1996 when she retired from party politics. After the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, Aloni expressed her sentiments that the agreements were a positive turning point on an historic scale: \"I feel like on the 29th of November [the date of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]; we did not know then what we were heading for, but we knew we were heading for great days. \"After the massacre of 29 Muslims in Hebron, West Bank on February 25, 1994 perpetrated by Baruch Goldstein, Aloni called for the expulsion of Jewish settlers from Hebron. She also condemned high school trips to Holocaust sites as she considered them to be detrimental to the spirit of Israeli youth. In a 2002 interview with American journalist Amy Goodman, Aloni said that charges of antisemitism are \"a trick we use\" to suppress criticism of Israel coming from within the United States, while for criticism coming from Europe \"we bring up the Holocaust. \"Aloni was a board member of Yesh Din, an organisation founded in 2005 which focuses on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories. She defended U. S. President Jimmy Carter's use of the word \"apartheid\" in the title of his book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid. Later, Aloni said, \"I hate to cover up things that should be open to the sun. \" With her husband, Reuven Aloni, she had three sons: Dror Aloni \u2013 later mayor of Kfar Shmaryahu and head of Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium Nimrod Aloni \u2013 an education philosopher Udi Aloni \u2013 a film director, writer and artistReuven Aloni died in 1988.

She is noted for writing historical fiction and psychological thrillers. Several of her novels dealt with controversial topics such as serial killers, pedophiles, child abuse, homosexuality, murder, and suicide.

Ghost Cadet has been Mrs. Alphin's most successful book to date, going through several editions in both hardback and paperback. The book's popularity with young readers prompted her publishers to ask for a companion novel \u2013 Ghost Soldier. In Tournament of Time, one of her early novels, an American school girl living in England befriends the ghosts of two medieval princes, allegedly murdered by Richard III in the Tower of London, and battles the 500-year-old ghost of their murderer.

Her gaze shifted to art when in 1970, she and Colette Garrison opened the Jennifer Pauls Gallery in Old Sacramento. Alquilar focused on expressionistic and figurative imagery and showcased artists such as Anne Gregory, Ken Little, Joan Moment and Mary Warner. She later became the sole owner of the gallery, and took it with her when she moved to Lake of the Pines and then Roseville. She eventually returned to Sacramento, installing the Jennifer Pauls Gallery in a shared space with the Himovitz/Solomon Gallery. In 1986, Alquilar sold the Jennifer Pauls Gallery to focus on her own art. She was well known for using bright, vibrant colors and dreamy imagery. She created over a multitude of mediums. She is most well known for her ceramic murals, many of which can be seen throughout Sacramento.

Hobie Alter will be remembered for creating the process of the foam-and-fiberglass surfboard & his subsequent creation of the Hobie Cat catamaran sailing boat line. His label, Hobie, remains one of the top-selling surfboard brands of all time. He is also the creator of the Hobie 33 ultralight-displacement sailboat and a mass-produced radio-controlled glider, the Hobie Hawk. During summer vacation 1950 \"Hobie\" hit on an idea . \"\"Hobie began by building 9-foot balsawood sufboards for his friends. He asked his dad to pull the Desoto out of the family's Laguna Beach, California garage, and converted it into a wood shop for his hobby. Hobie's hobby became a business and in discussing the future with friends as a young man \"Hobie\" declared that he wanted to make a living without having to wear hard-soled shoes or work east of California's Pacific Coast Highway. By \u201cMaking people a toy and giving them a game to play with it\u201d. A couple of years later, Hobie opened up Southern California's first surf shop in Dana Point, California. 1958 Hobie and Gordon \"Grubby\" Clark began experiments making surfboards out of foam and fiberglass. The new boards were lighter, faster and more responsive than wooden ones. Several famous surfers surfed for the Hobie Team, including Joey Cabell, Phil Edwards, Corky Carroll, Gary Propper, Mickey Munoz, Joyce Hoffman and Yancy Spencer. Hobie was born and raised in Ontario, California, but his family had a summer house in Laguna Beach, where Alter got into the full array of ocean sports. Initiated into surfing by Walter Hoffman, he started shaping balsa boards in the early 1950s. When the family's front yard became cluttered with the remnants of surfboard production, his father moved him off the property by buying him a lot on Pacific Coast Highway in nearby Dana Point for $1,500. That was 1953. In February 1954, with the first stage of the shop completed, Hobie Surfboards opened its doors after a total investment of $12,000. \"People laughed at me for setting up a surf shop,\" Hobie remembers. \"They said that once I'd sold a surfboard to each of the 250 surfers on the coast, I'd be out of business. But the orders just kept coming. \"Alter began making skateboards in 1962 and by 1964 he teamed up with the Vita Pakt juice company to create Hobie Skateboards. Alter went on to sponsor the Hobie Super Surfer skateboard team. Alter hired other board-builders, including Phil Edwards and Reynolds Yater. With the introduction of foam-and-fiberglass technology, Alter brought Joe Quigg over from Hawaii to help keep up with demand. Then came the high-volume production shapers like Ralph Parker and Terry Martin, guys who have shaped hundreds of thousands of surfboards over the years. Other Hobie shapers included Dewey Weber, Mickey Munoz, Corky Carroll, Don Hansen. Bruce Jones and the Patterson brothers. After experimenting with foam for a couple of years, Hobie made a breakthrough in 1958, finally achieving the right skin hardness for shapeability with the right core density for strength. He decided to set up a separate foam-blowing operation in nearby Laguna Canyon and recruited one of his glassers, Gordon \"Grubby\" Clark, to make polyurethane surfboard blanks. Almost immediately, Gidget was released, and surfing (and the demand for surfboards) boomed. \"If that movie had come out in the balsa era,\" said Alter, \"no one could have supplied them. \"The new foam boards were called Speedo Sponges and Flexi-Fliers, and Hobie was soon manufacturing 250 a week. Clark eventually took over the foam operation, renaming it Clark Foam, and he serviced the lion's share of the world's surfboard blank market until abruptly shutting down the company in 2005. Alter was a surfing competitor in his younger days. He won the second Brooks Street contest in Laguna in 1954 and placed third and fourth at the Makaha International Surfing Championships in 1958 and 1959. He achieved success as a tandem surfer, placing second in the event at Makaha in 1962. Alter made the Guinness Book of World Records in 1964, surfing the wake of a motorboat 26 miles from Long Beach to Catalina Island. Alter's Hobie Cat became the nucleus of a very successful worldwide catamaran business. The company created 16 unique sail boats from the Hobie 10, once designed to compete with the Laser, to the Hobie 33, a 33-foot (10 m) monohull. lift-keel boat. Alter sold Hobie Cat to the Coleman Company, Inc. in 1976, and his sons Hobie Jr. and Jeff carry on the family tradition, operating Hobie Designs and overseeing the company's licensing operations. Before his death, Alter would divide his time between the mountains of Idaho (where he skied in the winter) and Orcas Island, the largest of the San Juan Islands in the Pacific Northwest, where he would anchor his 60-foot, foam-core, twin-Diesel power catamaran, that he designed and built for himself.

He was known for compositions such as \"Soul and Violin\", \"Night Whistle\", \"Go Albirroja Go\" - the most popular song dedicated to the Paraguayan football team - and several symphonic poems. In addition to his musical career, he took a Bachelor's degree in journalism at the National University of Asunci\u00f3n. He has now been playing the violin professionally for about seventy years. His parents were Turiano \u00c1lvarez and Ramona Florent\u00edn. His musical bent was evident to his parents at an early stage, since at the age of 8 he had already made himself a violin and taught himself to play it. The young Lorenzo soon decided that he wanted to become a musician, as music was a passion for him and he was aware of his talent for the violin. At the age of 11 he moved to the departmental capital, Encarnaci\u00f3n, to begin his musical studies in a culturally important centre under teachers who would help him to improve himself. It was the Molinas brothers who gave him the first impulse in the field of musical studies. He made his debut as a musician as a member of their band. He stayed for more than a decade in the region where he was born, and then in 1950 he moved to Asunci\u00f3n to try for success there, offering his talent as a violinist in any band that needed his skills while he was completing his higher-level studies with the most recognized and renowned teachers. In 1952, Leonardo Alarc\u00f3n formed a big band that bore his name and invited Lorenzo to be one of its members. Alarc\u00f3n was a musician and composer, trumpeter in the Band of Police Musicians of the capital, and a former pupil of Salvador D\u00e9ntice. From then on the young Lorenzo \u00c1lvarez had the opportunity to work professionally with true musical artists. After staying for a year in Alarc\u00f3n's ensemble, \u00c1lvarez took an important step in his career when the renowned composer and conductor Florent\u00edn Gim\u00e9nez invited him to be first violin in his \"Traditional and Modern\" group, which in the mid-fifties had a reputation hard to match. Its 14 members included well-known figures such as Oscar Escobar, Carlos Centurion, Juan Carlos Miranda, and Jorge Alonso, and the group performed at the most important social events throughout Paraguay. His priorities for continuing his musical education included improvements in his violin playing and studies of theory and sight-reading. He studied under Alfredo Kamprad at the Normal School of Music, where in 1955 he was appointed senior teacher of violin. He studied theory and sight-reading with Rodolfo Bagnati and harmony with Juan Carlos Moreno Gonz\u00e1lez, and a year later he completed his training studying composition with Florent\u00edn Gim\u00e9nez. In 1959 he won first prize in a composition contest organized by the Municipality of Asunci\u00f3n. In the early 1960s \u00c1lvarez started the \"International Rhythm Band\", refreshing the Paraguayan dance repertoire with selections of polkas and foreign hits over more than a decade. For several decades he concentrated on violin performance, joining well-known bands and later directing bands of his own. Then in 1970 he reduced his professional playing in order to deepen his violin studies and expand his knowledge of harmony and composition. He remained as a performer in the Symphony Orchestra of the City of Asunci\u00f3n (OSCA), of which he had been a member since its beginning in 1957, and stayed on until his retirement in 1992. Among his most famous works are: \"Soul and Violin\", a joyful piece whose interpretation requires great skill in violin performance, \"Night Whistle\", \"Sweet Melody\", \"Cirilo R. Zayas\u201d, and most of all the march \"La Albirroja\" composed with \u00c1ngel Peralta Arellano. Other works by him include \"Madrecita M\u00eda\", \"Che hait\u00e9ma lo mit\u00e2\", \"Purah\u00e9i\", \"Gustav\u00ed\", \"Mirtha Elizabeth\", \"Luisito\", \"Maria Victoria\" and \"Gladys Sunilda\", all with Rudi Torga, dedicated to his children, in addition to the symphonic poems: \"Jasy Ret\u00e2\", \"Sailor on the High Seas\", \"Malec\u00f3n del Puerto\", \"Journey to the Horizon\", among others. At the age of 78 he was still very active musically: at that time he was conducting the Jos\u00e9 Asunci\u00f3n Flores folk orchestra at the National Conservatory of Music. In this institution he was teaching the violin, and also giving special performances, either with his son Lu\u00eds, with Juan Cancio Barreto or with Berta Rojas.

Alves was one of the founders of liberation theology. Alves was born on September 15, 1933, in Boa Esperan\u00e7a, Minas Gerais, Brazil. He obtained his Bachelor of Theology (BTh) degree at the Presbyterian Seminary in Campinas, Brazil, in 1957. He went on to obtain a Master of Theology (ThM) from the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, United States, in 1964. After completing this degree, Alves returned to Brazil amidst a US-sponsored military coup against the democratically elected Brazilian government. At the time, the new military regime was attempting to purge Brazil of communist sympathizers. The Presbyterian Church of Brazil provided the new government with the names of six intellectuals to serve as scapegoats and to avert persecution themselves. Immediately upon his return to Brazil, Alves went into hiding. More than forty accusations were made against Alves and others, including claims that they taught that Jesus was sexually involved with a prostitute, celebrated when their children denounced Americans, and were funded by the Soviet Union. Alves reports that these accusations were ineffective, saying, \"the positive side of the document was that it was so virulent, that not even the most obtuse could believe that we were guilty of so many crimes. \" Alves continued to elude government authorities. Within two months of his arrival in Brazil, he returned to the United States covertly with assistance from Brazilian Freemasons and the Presbyterian Church in the United States, which secured an invitation from Princeton Theological Seminary for him to commence doctoral studies there. Alves did not enjoy his studies at Princeton. He sorely missed his homeland, and felt constrained by the requirements of the doctoral program. Although he ultimately wrote his dissertation according to the requirements of his professors, Alves was not pleased with it, saying, \"I wrote uglily, without smiles or poetry, for there was no other alternative: a Brazilian student, underdeveloped, in a foreign institution, must indeed submit himself, if he wants to pass. \" He completed his doctoral dissertation, Toward a Theology of Liberation, in 1968, and received \"the lowest possible grade\" needed to receive his doctorate (PhD) at Princeton in 1968. Alves later critiqued the direction some writers took liberation theology, saying \"it has little to say about the personal dimension of life. If a father or mother comes with their dead child, it's no consolation to say, 'In the future just society there will be no more deaths of this kind. ' This brings no comfort!\" However, he also described liberation theology as \"absolutely essential\", describing his own version of liberation theology with these words: \"The origin of my liberation theology is an erotic exuberance for life. We need to struggle to restore its erotic exuberance, to share this with the whole world. \" Trained as a psychoanalyst through the Brazilian Association of Psychoanalysis of S\u00e3o Paulo. Assistant Professor of Social Philosophy, Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters of Rio Claro (1969). Assistant Professor of Philosophy, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) (1974). He was promoted to professor (1979) and associate professor (1980), both at the Faculty of Education, UNICAMP. Besides his activities as a university professor and researcher, Alves was a prolific writer of books and articles in journals and newspapers on education, psychology and life in general. From 1986 he was a regular columnist in Correio Popular, the main newspaper in his hometown, Campinas, in S\u00e3o Paulo state. He published more than 40 books, several of which have been translated into German, French, English, Italian, Spanish and Romanian. During his career he collaborated with notable personalities, including Peter Maurin, Dorothy Day, and Paulo Freire. His book, The Poet, The Warrior, The Prophet, is an important text in the field of theopoetics. During the last years of his life, Alves wrote several children's books. Alves died on July 19, 2014, in Campinas, Brazil. Alves has been described as an \"unsung hero\", and is often omitted from brief descriptions of liberation theology. \u2014.

His novel Inhin Hathiyaron Se earned him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2007, and Vyas Samman in year 2009. He was awarded Jnanpith Award for the year 2009. Amarkant is considered as one of the prominent writers of the story writing tradition of Premchand but certainly is credited to add something better in that tradition by his own individuality. Amarkant was born in 1925 in Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh. He took active part in the Quit India Movement of 1942 which caused him to abandon his studies for a few years. He completed his graduation from Allahabad University and pursued a career in journalist with local Hindi newspapers. In late 2000s, the octogenarian Amarkant was fighting against penury. He died at the of 89 on 17 February 2014. He is survived by two sons and a daughter. Amarkant is best known for his short stories although he also published six novels. His short stories, such as Deputy Collectory, Dopahar ka Bhojan (The Lunch), Zindagi aur Jonk (Life and the Leech) and Hatyaare (The Assassins), are considered milestones in post-Independence fiction. He started writing in a period when the Nai Kahani (New Story) movement was heralding a big thematic and structural shift, and almost overshadowed the tradition of Premchand which used to be the mainstream fiction in Hindi. This movement focussed more on urban settings, individual characteristics, man-woman relationships, and so on, in place of people in villages and small towns. The scene was dominated by authors such as Mohan Rakesh, Kamaleshwar and Rajendra Yadav, aggressive advocates of the movement as a new metaphor for and of modern society. Amarkant was one of the few writers who stuck to the \u2018social realistic' tradition of Premchand. Literary critics like Dr Vishwanath Tripathi consider his short stories to be in the lineage of Premchand's later works, particularly his masterpiece Qafan (The Shroud), which is a compactly crafted tale of a Dalit family. The portrayal of Siddheshwari Devi in Dopahar ka Bhojan, Babu Sakaldip Singh in Deputy Collectory and Rajua in Zindagi aur Jonk are intricate and remarkable. For instance, Siddheshwari Devi in Dopahar ka Bhojan distributes a very limited quantity of food amongst her retrenched husband and unemployed children so that nobody feels half-fed, but in the end when nothing but half a roti is left for her, she cries silently. The beauty of Amarkant's writing lies in its simplicity, which the critic Pranaya Krishna described as \u201cthe most difficult pursuit\u201d. Amarkant goes deep into the sociology as well as the psychology of his characters without any cathartic drama and turns them into authentic representatives of our social margins. His short stories of the later period mark a shift to urban brutalities. In Hatyaare, he describes two young bullies who boast to each other about being close to leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and John F. Kennedy, about refusing the offer of the Prime Minister's post, and about being Presidents. They sexually exploit a poor woman, deprive her of her wages and, while running away, knife to death a man chasing them. It is a dark and cruel world profiled in a tense, mocking language. During a drinking bout, one of the bullies says: \u201cWretch! You're a coward! I was thinking that when I become Prime Minister, I'd make you the President of the Society for the Prevention of Corruption and the Society for the Abolition of Casteism. But if you can't drink this much, then how are you going to take bribes from officials? How will you make forgeries? How will you tell lies? How then are you going to serve the country, scum?\u201d Amarkant's own life has been full of struggles. At a time when a journalist's job was not a lucrative one, he worked most of his life in that profession with various newspapers, literary periodicals, and news magazines published by Mitra Prakashan in Allahabad. Born in Balia on 1 July 1925, he was, as a 17-year-old student, attracted to the Quit India movement headed by stalwarts such as Acharya Narendra Dev, Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan. Gandhiji's \u201cDo or Die\u201d call had a historic impact on Balia, along with Satara in Maharashtra and Medinipur in West Bengal. An independent government was formed for 10 days in Balia and non-violent revolutionaries took over police stations and tehsils and freed prisoners from the jail. Later, in 2003, this history surfaced in Amarkant's voluminous novel Inheen Hathiyaron Se (With These Weapons Alone), which focusses on the people rather than the leaders involved in the movement. One of the characters in the novel says: \u201cCall it Gandhi storm, old dame storm or mega storm, it is a well-known storm in human history. Yes, this is the oldest storm. It repeats itself wherever there is slavery, atrocity, injustice, and dictatorship. \u201d Amarkant's other notable novels include Kaale Ujale Din, Sukhjeevee and Sunaar Pande ki Patohu.

Although he had studied a wide range of spiritual traditions, including Kabbalah, the Fourth Way and Hindu teachings, it was his conversion to the Eastern Orthodox Church and his relationship with Mount Athos, the ancient monastic republic in Greece, that ultimately defined his life and work. Over a thirty-year period, between 1982 and 2013, he made more than 60 visits to Mount Athos, where he was recognised as a \"synergatis\", a fellow worker and equal of the monks. Amis documented the results of his research in A Different Christianity: Early Christian Esotericism and Modern Thought (SUNY, 1995), and recounted his experience on the Holy Mountain in Views from Mount Athos (Praxis 2014). As founder of Praxis Institute Press, he translated, edited and published the three volume English language edition of Gnosis by Boris Mouravieff as well as books on Hesychasm and the spiritual tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He was married to the American artist Lillian Delevoryas and in the last years of his life lived in Bristol, England. Robin Amis was born on 10 June 1932 in Finchley, London, to Henry \"Glennie\" Amis and Dorothy Amis (Beckton). His early schooling was at Frinton-on-Sea, but because of the outbreak of the Second World War he was evacuated at the age of 7 to Portmerion in North Wales. He remained there until the age of 12 and continued his education at St Bees School on the edge of the Lake District National Park. After school Amis found work in the electronics industry. His skill in writing and designing electronic manuals led him to becoming an advertising copywriter. He worked for various agencies including Arthur Wasey, J. Walter Thompson, and Riley Advertising where he became creative director. In the early 1960s, Amis expanded his writing skills and turned to poetry as a medium. In 1989, some of his early poetry was published in Who Writes the Waves (Agora Books and Two Rivers Farm Press). In the early 1960s Amis joined the Study Society in London, which was led by one of P. D. Ouspensky's former students, Francis Roles. By the late 1960s, Amis was leading study groups in various parts of England, including Bristol, Birmingham, Sussex and Gloucestershire. Amis met and married American artist Lillian Delevoryas in 1972. Together they opened Weatherall Workshops in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. The Weatherall Design Studio specialised in tapestry and applique wall-hangings and the work was supervised by Delevoryas and fellow American designer Kaffe Fassett. The Workshops won a number of national awards at Courtauld House, as well as exhibiting at the Victoria and Albert Museum and The Royal College of Art for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977. Weatherall gained its reputation as an example of using varied artistic skills to create large original works of an exceptional standard, often employing a large number of people in a non-competitive environment for periods of time as short as one weekend to residential courses lasting for a fortnight. This artistic endeavour was also a way of applying Fourth Way principles and practices of self-remembering and working with attention, as defined by P. D. Ouspensky and George Gurdjieff. The project closed in 1979. In 1979, Amis took a group of his students to meet with Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh, Bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church. This meeting, in turn, led to Amis' interest in Orthodoxy and the ancient monastic tradition that had been preserved on Mount Athos. Amis first visited Athos in 1982 and by chance met with Gerald Palmer, a former student of Ouspensky who had converted to Orthodoxy in 1950. Palmer's spiritual teacher on Athos was Father Nikon who encouraged Palmer to acquire, translate and publish the Philokalia, the compendium of teachings of the Church Fathers of the Eastern Orthodox Church. This translation was started by Gerald Palmer and E. Kadloubovsky, and continued by Palmer, Kallistos Ware and Philip Sherrard. It was begun at a time when very few Orthodox books were available in the English language. As a result of his meeting with Gerald Palmer as well as Ware and Sherrard, Amis set up Praxis Institute Press in 1985. The press published a number of works on the Orthodox tradition, including: The Eros of Repentance, The Path of Prayer, The Heart of Salvation: The Life and Teachings of Theophan the Recluse, and A Method of Prayer for Modern Times. Praxis also published an audio tape of sayings from the Philokalia on Prayer of the Heart, compiled by Palmer and read by Sergei (Kadloubovsky) Kadleigh. Amis\u2019 initial visits to Mount Athos in turn led to his own conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy in 1983. Between 1987 and 1993, Amis and a small team that included Lillian Amis, Sergei Kadleigh and his wife Leslie, translated, edited and published the three volume work, Gnosis, A Study and Commentary on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy by Mouravieff. Originally published in France between 1960 and 1963, Gnosis was based on the course entitled \"An Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\" that Mouravieff had taught at the University of Geneva. The work delineated a teaching that, unlike those of P. D. Ouspensky and G. I. Gurdjieff, was openly grounded in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The translation received funding and support by a number of former pupils of Ouspensky and Gurdjieff that included: Aubrey Wolton, and Ailsa Lenney, the secretary of Kenneth Walker. The publication of Gnosis into English aroused controversy in some Gurdjieff circles who disputed the claim made by Mouravieff and Amis that linked the origin of Gurdjieff's material and teaching to Eastern Orthodoxy. Amis outlined his position and the results of his research in an article published in Gnosis magazine, entitled, 'Mouravieff and the Secret of the Source' and at the first All and Everything Conference in England 1996. In his later years Amis concentrated on writing, lecturing and teaching. He continued to make regular bi-annual visits to Mount Athos, establishing a close relationship with Osiou Gregoriou monastery, its Abbot, Archimandrite George Kapsanis, and the brotherhood of monks there. The importance of this relationship is highlighted in A Study of English Orthodox Theological Terms published by Gregoriou Monastery in which Amis is credited with pointing out \"the confusion present in English terms\" in a number of important English language translations of key Orthodox texts as well as important observations on the condition of the Western psyche. During those visits, Amis placed himself under obedience with an elder, Saint Paisios of Mount Athos. At one of these meeting St. Paisios told him: \"You English have served man very well with your intellect, giving him many things he needs, the solutions to many problems that have made life easier for everyone. Now you should do another work \u2013 to understand and tell the world of the inner truth, the truth of the heart as well\". In many ways this instruction defined the latter part of Amis's life, which he devoted to this task. He formed Praxis Research Institute and working with a small number of associates and students around the world through video conferencing he developed his ideas for bringing Hesychasm to spiritual seekers who have to live and work in the world. Amis documented the results of his research in his book A Different Christianity, which was published by the State University of New York Press in 1995. A Different Christianity, which has remained in print for the last twenty years has been influential in making available to a wider non-Orthodox audience in the West the experiential knowledge and inner practices contained within Eastern Orthodoxy and in particular the Athonite spiritual tradition. In 2005 he published a translation of Book One of 'Triads in Defence of the Holy Hesychasts' by Gregory Palamas under the title of The Triads: Book One. Amis continued work on this text until his death, revising the translation and preparing a commentary. This work was published in 2016 under the title 'Holy Hesychia: The Stillness That Knows God'. In addition he was also working on another book Kardia, a follow up to A Different Christianity, which detailed and made accessible many aspects of monastic tradition for practical application in ordinary life, which is yet to be published.

Ben Carter was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a Baptist family. After dropping out of high school, Carter served three years in the United States Army, where he earned an equivalency degree. After Carter was discharged from the Army, he worked as a metallurgist at Chicago's Howard Foundry. In 1961, a co-worker introduced him to the idea that African Americans are descendants of the Biblical Israelites. Carter began to attend meetings of black Israelite groups, and was given a Hebrew name, Ben Ammi Ben-Israel. According to the Hebrew Israelite community, in 1966, Ben Ammi received a vision from the angel Gabriel, who told him to lead African-Americans to Israel. In the vision, he claimed he was instructed to: \"Lead the children of Israel among African Americans to the promised land, and establish the long-awaited Kingdom of God. \" In any case, Ben Ammi was one of four members of the Abeta Hebrew Israel Cultural Center to be chosen to travel to Liberia to explore the possibility of settlement there. In July 1967, a number of Abeta families began to arrive in Liberia, settling in spartan conditions on land purchased by an African American citizen of Liberia on behalf of the community. According to one account, Ben Ammi began his rise to leadership within the group around Passover in 1968. In accordance with their belief that they were the descendants of ancient Israelites, community members planned to sacrifice an lamb or kid (baby goat) as part of the observance of the holiday. When the goat acquired for the occasion was found accidentally strangled, and therefore ritually impure to be used as a sacrifice, Ben Ammi made a speech declaring that the faith and observance of the Black Hebrews was the true sacrifice that God desired. The Abeta settlers were not welcomed by the Liberian government, and suffered from economic and social difficulties. Many of them died from diseases. In 1969, Ben Ammi visited Israel to once again explore the possibility the group's relocation. Taking advantage of the ambiguous attitudes of Israeli authorities, the community was able to immigrate to Israel. According to Ben Ami, tickets were purchased for their upcoming journey with the proceeds from the sale of two ice cream shops that had been established for the group's benefit in Monrovia\u2014as well as some \"divine intelligence. \" In 1970, 48 families immigrated to Israel, claiming their right to stay there under Israel's Law of Return. Ben Ammi and more of his followers arrived in the ensuing months, settling in the Negev city of Dimona. Others settled in Arad and Mitzpe Ramon The community was eventually given permanent residency in 1990, and later were entitled to acquire Israeli citizenship by naturalization, which does not imply any Jewish status. Ben Ammi served as the community's spiritual and political leader during this time, authoring a number of books. Ben Ammi died in a hospital in Be'er Sheva, Israel on December 27, 2014. At the time of his death, Ben Ammi had four wives\u2014Tikvah, Yoninah, Baht Zion and Baht Ammi\u2014as well as 25 children, 45 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren. Ben Ammi claimed that he and the Black Hebrews from the original Liberian settlement were not Jews but Hebrews, the true descendants of the ancient Israelites. Ben Ammi originally believed that Moses and Abraham were black, and that the Black Hebrews were the only \"true\" inheritors of Israel. While rejecting the modern religious forms of both Judaism and Christianity, he maintained the divine inspiration of the Tanakh, and perceived Yeshua as one of an ongoing line of 'messiahs' sent by God to keep the people of Israel in the ways of righteousness. The core of the group's lifestyle is the Tanakh, Ben Ammi claimed that \"the Law and the Prophets. . . are the light; they are the essence of what is required to set man on the path and show him the way back to his Maker. \" However the group reject the traditions of Rabbinic Judaism including the Talmud as inauthentic to Hebrew religion. Ben Ammi claimed that Africans are the victims of \"a cruel plot to control us, an international religious plot that came about as a result of Blacks disobeying the law and commandments of God. \" In the attempt to overcome the history of slavery and the bondage in America, Ammi argues that it is essential to \"reexamine and redefine all things. . . we must question every facet of existence under Euro-gentile dominion. \" The ability to name and classify the word and social concepts Ammi calls \"The Power to Define\", which in the wrong hands is \"one of the greatest weapons that can be used to control men and nations,\" but is the key to salvation from past oppression. Ben Ammi translated his perspective of Africa's problems being \"spiritual problems\" into an expansive set of socio-political, economic, agricultural and health-related positions. He emphasized the need for African Leaders to \"learn from their history and the African Cultural Value System\", in order to combat the \"perception engineering\" which is conducted by many Western institutions. During a 2002 interview with Rob Redding of the Redding News Review, Ben Ammi expressed confidence in his community's ability to continue on in the case of his departure. When asked specifically \"What are the provisions within the community, to take care of the community, should something happen to you?\" he responded \"It is the word that I speak, the truth that I speak, that is deeply embedded in their souls. . . I am flesh, blood, and spirit - but it is the spirit I possess; the spirit the ancient prophets possess, that is of such significance to the redemption of our people. \" Defining himself to simply be a \"representative\" of this Holy Spirit, Ben Ammi carefully distinguished the community which he has presided over since the late 1960s from a \"sect\" or \"cult\" that is at risk of social or political disintegration as a result of his absence, citing the long-term implications of Daniel 2:44 for biblical reference Ben-Israel was revered as a messianic figure in the community, his picture adorning at least one wall in every apartment. In an interview, Ben Ammi described his status as a prophet and spiritual leader: My anointing did not come until after we had arrived in Israel. The Father sent a prophet to anoint me and to let me know the further off or great portion of my mission. . . At the time he anointed me. . . I received the name Nasi Hashalom [The Prince of Peace]. . . Later on this same prophet came again to tell me according to the word of God that at a later date someone would be sent to anoint me to sit on the throne of David in the spirit and to fulfill the prophecies of he that was to sit on the throne of David. The words of a true prophet, they certainly came to pass, and it took place just as he said. Afterwards, from Nasi Hashalom my name was changed to Rabbey and Adoni Rabbey [My Lord and Master]. According to the Hebrew Israelite community, singer and actress Whitney Houston claimed Ben-Israel as her spiritual father. In March 2010, Ben Ammi received a Lifetime Achievement Award in Ghana, West Africa. This award is given out by the Ghanaian Country Awards Council. At the ceremony, the Country Director of CACG (Country Awards Council Ghana) stated that Ben Ammi \"has helped bridged the gap between spirituality and development like no other leader before in global history, in the process creating new and progressive options for successfully building communities and projects based on enduring righteous, African cultural principles. \" With these achievements, BBC's \"Focus on Africa\" magazine in the year 2000 named him the \"One of the Most Influential Africans of the Last Millennium\".

His cultural work grew out of his initial teaching job, when the director of the Palacio de Bellas Artes refused to help him bring musicians to play in Monterrey. He founded the Sociedad Art\u00edstica Tecnol\u00f3gico, which he directed for thirty two years, followed by stints directing several museums and other cultural institutions. He also has written poetry, essays, books and a play. Jos\u00e9 Emilio Amores was born in Frontera, Tabasco; however, three months later, his family went to live permanently in Mexico City. He did his schooling there, obtaining a bachelors in chemistry from the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico . When he arrived to Monterrey in the 1940s, he thought the city was ugly, squat and hot, but soon found things that he felt were important, respect for human life and individuality, with little violence compared to the rest of the country. He says that people there felt that the north of the country had no culture, although he disagreed with that. He stated that they were aware that they had a \u201cculture\u201d of working and saving, distinct from the rest of the country, but did not accept that as culture as in artistic expression. Amores has been active well into his later years. As of the late 1990s, he stated he still liked to travel in Mexico, although he can no longer do long-distance driving. His house is filled with elements related to the arts including a piano, sculptures, paintings, books, records and videos. Two of his closest friends are Virgilioi Garza and Ram\u00f3n Lamadrid, with the three calling themselves the \u201cLos Memelos. \u201d Amores began his career at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies in 1944, become one of the first chemistry teachers at the institution. His father reading the paper found an announcement for the job as a chemistry teacher and mentioned it to his son. Amores walked fifteen city blocks to the office in Mexico City where he met the first director of the Tec de Monterrey Le\u00f3n \u00c1valos y Vez. The director was impressed with his references, which included those of Manuel Sandoval Vallarta and Carlos Graef Fern\u00e1ndez, two of the founders of modern physics in Mexico. Soon after, he was on a bus to Monterrey and worked in the first building to house the institution. In 1947, Amores became the director of the preparatory and began to teach algebra as well. He remained director of the preparatory until 1959, then was director of the engineering and architecture school from 1959 to 1966 and vice-rector of academics from 1966 to 1969. In 1947, Amores was asked to visit the director of the Palacio de Bellas Artes, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez to see about having some young musicians play at the Tec de Monterrey. However, he was not well-received, with the director saying \u201cLook, I will never waste my time in the provinces, but if someday I do, I will not work with a private institution; I will work with the government. \u201d However, the school was able to get a local business to sponsor a piano recital by Walter Hautzig, with Amores needing to find a piano. This was one of a number of performances to follow. The success of these events led to the creation of the Sociedad Art\u00edstica Tecnol\u00f3gico, which he directed for thirty two years. This work led him to become a major force in the development of the arts in the city. He retired from the Tec de Monterrey in 1969 and held a number of positions in organizations such as director of the Desarrollo Social del Grupo Alfa, undersecretary of culture for Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the director of the Museo de Monterrey (1988-1990), the director of the Centro Cultural Alfa, the director of the Museo de Historia Mexicana and the director of Radio Nuevo Le\u00f3n (1996-1998) . Although generally known as a \u201ccultural promoter\u201d he does not see himself that way, just one of many in the city who does what he does. In 1998 he was paid homage by the city for his cultural work. He began to write poetry five years after he retired from the Tec de Monterrey, and has written essays and books as well. Many of his essays related to efforts to save green spaces in Monterrey, such as Parque Fundida, but was not always successful. His books include Los siete d\u00edas de la creaci\u00f3n (1977), Lectura de Hoy (1978) and the chapter Monterrey: Una cultura propia in Nuevo Le\u00f3n en el Siglo XX:La Industrializaci\u00f3n Vol II (2007). He also wrote a play called Fonda Las Ilusiones, which was first presented at the Museo El Centenario in Monterrey.

In addition to directing and acting in theater, and engaging in a number of social causes, he loved photography and spent his free time sketching with pastels. He was a dear friend to many, an eloquent orator, and a sensitive human being who raised his voice to support righteous causes and denounce the ills in the Indian society. He is survived by his writer wife, Sunanda Amrapurkar, three daughters, and three sons-in-law. After his death in his memory Ahmednagar's Think Global Foundation started giving Late Sadashiv Amarapurkar Award which has become very popular in a short span. Kiran Kale, President of Think Global Foundation conceptualized this initiative. In 2016, the famous Marathi writer and IT expert Achyut Godbole and renounced social worker and writer Deepa Deshmukh honored with this award. In 2017, the famous playback Singer Suresh Wadkar was honored with this award by the auspicious hands of the veteran actor Vikram Gokhale. Amrapurkar started his career as an actor in Marathi theatre, eventually acting and directing nearly fifty plays, before transitioning to films. He made his film debut with the role of Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 22 June 1987, a Marathi historical film directed by Jayoo Patwardhan and Nachiket Patwardhan. He won a number of awards in theatre and film. His first film was Govind Nihalani's Ardha Satya (1983), for which he won a Filmfare Award.

This play was successful and Amrapurkar was noticed by director Govind Nihalani, who was searching for an actor to play the central negative character in his movie Ardh Satya. The movie went on to be a hit and Amrapurkar's acting was appreciated. His style of dialog delivery was considered unique as compared to the popular Hindi movie villains in those days. Amrapurkar won a Filmfare Award for his performance in the film. After Ardha Satya, Amarapurkar starred in Purana Mandir, Nasoor, Muddat, Jawani and Khamosh. In 1986, he starred as the villain in the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Aakhree Raasta. In 1987, he starred as the main villain in the Dharmendra-starrer Hukumat, which went on to be a blockbuster that grossed even more than Mr. India. From 1988 he increasingly appeared in villainous roles in films such as Mohre, Khatron Ke Khiladi, Kaal Chakra, Eeshwar, Elaan-E-Jung, Farishtay, Veeru Dada, Naaka Bandi and Begunaah.

He played the role of a tough, upright cop who reprimands his children for leaving an elderly widow to fend for herself on the streets. The film touched on the problems old people face with the breakdown of the joint family system. It was a subject close to Sadashiv's heart and he did the role for free.

He always had a soft spot for the rural youth and strove for their development. In March 2013, he protested water waste during the Holi festival near his residence in Mumbai. Despite playing a variety of roles in Bollywood, and winning awards for his performances, Amrapurkar's heart was somewhere else; he wanted to use his skills and resources for social causes. As a performer, he was talented and hard-working. But he was more of a social activist than an actor. Amrapurkar also lent his support to the Anna Hazare movement in 2011 and was active in engaging citizens during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections by holding several discussions to make voters aware of their rights.

He was born in Thirtahalli Taluk and is considered as one of the pioneers of the Navya movement. He is the sixth writer to be honored with the Jnanpith Award for the Kannada language, the highest literary honour conferred in India. In 1998, he received the Padma Bhushan award from the Government of India. He was the vice-chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi University in Kerala during the late 1980s. He was one of the finalists of Man Booker International Prize for the year 2013. He remained a fervent critic of nationalistic political parties until his death from renal failure and cardiac arrest on 22 August 2014. Ananthamurthy was born into Kannada-speaking Madhwa Brahmin family in Melige, in Tirthahalli taluk in the Shimoga District. His education started in a traditional Sanskrit school in Doorvasapura and continued in Tirthahalli and Mysore. After receiving a Master of Arts degree from the University of Mysore, U. R. Ananthamurthy taught in the English department at University of Mysore (pictured) for a while before embarking to England for further studies on a Commonwealth Scholarship. He earned his doctorate from the University of Birmingham in 1966 for his dissertation thesis entitled \"Politics and Fiction in the 1930s\". Ananthamurthy started his career as a professor and instructor in 1970 in English department of University of Mysore. He was the Vice-Chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi University in Kottayam, Kerala from 1987 to 1991. He served as the Chairman of National Book Trust India for the year 1992. In 1993 he was elected as the president of Sahitya Academy. He served as a visiting professor in many Indian and foreign universities including Jawaharlal Nehru University, University of T\u00fcbingen, University of Iowa, Tufts University and Shivaji University. Ananthamurthy served twice as the Chairman of the Film and Television Institute of India. In 2012 he was appointed the first Chancellor of Central University of Karnataka. Ananthamurthy has participated and delivered lectures in numerous seminars as writer and orator both in and outside the country. He was the member of the committee of Indian writers and visited countries like the Soviet Union, Hungary, France and West Germany in 1990. He visited Moscow in 1989 as board member for a Soviet newspaper. Ananthamurthy was the leader for the committee of writers who visited China in 1993. Ananthamurthy's works have been translated into several Indian and European languages and have been awarded with important literary prizes. His main works include \"Prashne\", \"Aakasha Mattu Bekku\", Samskara, Bhava, Bharathipura, and Avasthe. He has written numerous short stories as well. Several of his novels and short fictions have been made into movies. Most of Ananthamurthy's literary works deal with psychological aspects of people in different situations, times and circumstances. His writings supposedly analyse aspects ranging from challenges and changes faced by Brahmin families of Karnataka to bureaucrats dealing with politics influencing their work. Most of his novels are on reaction of individuals to situations that are unusual and artificial. Results of influences of sociopolitical and economic changes on traditional Hindu societies of India and clashes due to such influences \u2013 between a father and a son, husband and wife, father and daughter and finally, the fine love that flows beneath all such clashes are portrayed by Ananthamurthy in his works. This is evident in his stories like Sooryana Kudure (The Grasshopper)\", Mouni (Silent Man)\", \"Karthika, \"Ghatashraddha\" etc. It does not mean that Ananthamurthy is just clinging to portraying only such somewhat standard subjects of Indian literature of his period. His novelette Bara (Drought) portrays the dynamics of a drought-stricken district of Karnataka and the challenges and dilemmas a bureaucrat may face in such situations. The central figure of the novel Sooryana Kudure \u2013 Venkata is shunned by his son and wife for his easy-going attitude that does not take him anywhere. Venkata is a non-achiever who could not achieve any material or monetary success in his life. However, he is a simpleton who does not take life's suffering to his heart too much. He likes to see life as living in the love of Amma (or mother-goddess). In all sufferings of life, he has the child-like curiosity about the smallest things in life like a grasshopper (Sooryana Kudure). The evening after his son revolts and leaves the house, he would be engrossed in a sight in his yard a grasshopper shining in the sun's light. His several novels were made into films like Samskara, Bara, Avaste, Mouni, \"Ghatashraddha\" and Diksha. U. R. Ananthamurthy met his wife Esther in 1954 and they were married in 1956. They had two children, Sharath and Anuradha. He resided in Bangalore for most of his later life. His son in law Vivek Shanbhag also was a famous writer in Kannada. U. R. Ananthamurthy made an unsuccessful run for the Lok Sabha in 2004 in which he stated that his prime ideological objective in opting to contest the elections was to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Prime Minister of India H. D. Deve Gowda had made an offer for Murthy to contest for his party. However, after the Janata Dal (Secular) worked a power sharing agreement with the BJP, Murthy said: Ananthamurthy also contested for the Rajya Sabha elections from state assembly in 2006. The idea proposed by Ananthamurthy to rename ten cities in Karnataka including Bengaluru from their colonial forms to actual native forms was accepted by the Government of Karnataka and the cities were renamed on the occasion of the golden jubilee celebrations of the formation of Karnataka. In June 2007, Ananthamurthy declared that he would not take part in literary functions in future in the wake of strong criticism for his reaction on S. L. Bhyrappa's controversial novel Aavarana that appeared in a section of the media. However Murthy's comment that Bhyrappa \"does not know how to write novels\" was criticized by some section of the media. In 2013, Murthy's statement that there is a reference in the Mahabharata to Brahmin's consuming beef drew flak from Hindu religious leaders. Vishwesha Teertha Swami of Pejawar Math commented that there was no reference to Brahmins consuming beef in the conversation between Bhishma and Yudhishtira or anywhere else in the Mahabharata and Murthy's statement came as a surprise to him. A vocal critic of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)/Jan Sangh for over 50 years, Murthy said in 2013 that he would not live in the country ruled by BJP leader Narendra Modi. He later clarified that those remarks were made when he was \"overcome by emotion\" and said that he had no such plan, though he continued to oppose BJP. Murthy was given special police protection after he began receiving threatening phone calls. Later when Modi became the Prime Minister he was given a free ticket to Pakistan by a group of Modi supporters called \"NaMo Brigade\". The co-founder of \"NaMo Brigade\", Chakravarti Sulibele, publicly criticised Murthy quoting: \"The mandate after the results were out was quite clear. Mr. Ananthamurthy must respect the majority sentiment and accept it. If he does not accept the mandate and thinks Pakistan is a more secular country, then that is where he should be living. \" He also added -\u201cWe decided to send him to Pakistan because he always talks about how our relationship with Muslims should be. So we thought maybe he likes Pakistan\u2019s secularism model better and better be sent there. \"After Murthy's death was announced on 22 August 2014, several BJP and Hindu Jagarana Vedike were booked for celebrating his death by bursting crackers at four places in Mangalore and one spot in Chikkamagaluru. 1984 : Rajyothsava Award 1994 : Jnanpith Award 1998 : Padma Bhushan 2004 : Sahitya Akademi Fellowship 2008 : Nadoja Award by Kannada University 2011 : Shortlisted for The Hindu Literary Prize (Bharathipura) 2012 : D.

The denial of his admission became a Supreme Court case, In re Anastaplo, in which he insisted that the First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution protects the privacy of political affiliations; in particular, he refused to answer questions about membership in the Communist Party. Anastaplo's stand was based on Constitutional principles and consequent rejection of McCarthyism, and nobody alleged that he had membership in the Communist Party. The Supreme Court's majority upheld the lower courts' ruling in favor of the Illinois Bar, although Justice Hugo Black dissented. After his Supreme Court case and denial of admission to the Bar, Anastaplo supported his family by teaching at the University of Chicago and other universities and colleges. He wrote many articles and books on philosophy, many of which acknowledged the influence of his teacher, Leo Strauss. The son of Greek immigrants, Anastaplo served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II as a navigator of B-17s and B-29s. After the war he attended the University of Chicago where he earned his B. A. in 1948 and his J. D. in 1951. Even while a law student, Anastaplo attended the lectures and seminars of Leo Strauss. After he had passed the Bar Exam, Anastaplo was asked a series of questions typical during the age of the Red Scare. He was asked whether members of the Communist Party should be allowed to enter the Bar and so be able to practice law, to which he replied yes. This prompted a series of questions where the interviewers asked him about the nature of Communism in America to which he retorted that political dissent and even the right of revolution were part of the American constitutional heritage. When asked whether he was a Communist, Anastaplo replied that freedom of association was guaranteed by the first amendment, and that it was improper for the Bar to ask about political affiliations of applicants. He continued to refuse to answer the question and eventually sued the Bar association, after which he promptly was counter-sued. Almost a decade later the case reached the Supreme Court. In 1961 Professor Leo Strauss bolstered Anastaplo's spirits when he was petitioning for admission to the Illinois Bar by writing the two-sentence letter: \"This is only to pay you my respects for your brave and just action. If the American Bench and Bar have any sense of shame they must come on their knees to apologize to you. \" Anastaplo argued the case himself before the U. S. Supreme Court, losing the case but being praised in the dissent by Justice Hugo Black. The effect of the Court's 'balancing' here is that any State may now reject an applicant for admission to the Bar if he believes in the Declaration of Independence as strongly as Anastaplo and if he is willing to sacrifice his career and his means of livelihood in defense of the freedoms of the First Amendment. But the men who founded this country and wrote our Bill of Rights were strangers neither to a belief in the 'right of revolution' nor to the urgency of the need to be free from the control of government with regard to political beliefs and associations. Thomas Jefferson was not disclaiming a belief in the 'right of revolution' when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. And Patrick Henry was certainly not disclaiming such a belief when he declared in impassioned words that have come on down through the years: 'Give me liberty or give me death. ' This country's freedom was won by men who, whether they believed in it or not, certainly practiced revolution in the Revolutionary War. Since the beginning of history there have been governments that have engaged in practices against the people so bad, so cruel, so unjust and so destructive of the individual dignity of men and women that the 'right of revolution' was all the people had left to free themselves. As simple illustrations, one government almost 2,000 years ago burned Christians upon fiery crosses and another government, during this very century, burned Jews in crematories. I venture the suggestion that there are countless multitudes in this country, and all over the world, who would join Anastaplo's belief in the right of the people to resist by force tyrannical governments like those. In saying what I have, it is to be borne in mind that Anastaplo has not indicated, even remotely, a belief that this country is an oppressive one in which the 'right of revolution' should be exercised. Quite the contrary, the entire course of his life, as disclosed by the record, has been one of devotion and service to his country-first, in his willingness to defend its security at the risk of his own life in time of war and, later, in his willingness to defend its freedoms at the risk of his professional career in time of peace. The one and only time in which he has come into conflict with the Government is when he refused to answer the questions put to him by the Committee about his beliefs and associations. And I think the record clearly shows that conflict resulted, not from any fear on Anastaplo's part to divulge his own political activities, but from a sincere, and in my judgment correct, conviction that the preservation of this country's freedom depends upon adherence to our Bill of Rights. The very most that can fairly be said against Anastaplo's position in this entire matter is that he took too much of the responsibility of preserving that freedom upon himself. This case illustrates to me the serious consequences to the Bar itself of not affording the full protections of the First Amendment to its applicants for admission. For this record shows that Anastaplo has many of the qualities that are needed in the American Bar. It shows, not only that Anastaplo has followed a high moral, ethical and patriotic course in all of the activities of his life, but also that he combines these more common virtues with the uncommon virtue of courage to stand by his principles at any cost. It is such men as these who have most greatly honored the profession of the law-men like Malsherbes, who, at the cost of his own life and the lives of his family, sprang unafraid to the defense of Louis XVI against the fanatical leaders of the Revolutionary government of France---men like Charles Evans Hughes, Sr. , later Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, who stood up for the constitutional rights of socialists to be socialists and public officials despite the threats and clamorous protests of self-proclaimed superpatriots---men like Charles Evans Hughes, Jr. , and John W. Davis, who, while against everything for which the Communists stood, strongly advised the Congress in 1948 that it would be unconstitutional to pass the law then proposed to outlaw the Communist Party---men like Lord Erskine, James Otis, Clarence Darrow, and the multitude of others who have dared to speak in defense of causes and clients without regard to personal danger to themselves. The legal profession will lose much of its nobility and its glory if it is not constantly replenished with lawyers like these. To force the Bar to become a group of thoroughly orthodox, time-serving, government-fearing individuals is to humiliate and degrade it. But that is the present trend, not only in the legal profession but in almost every walk of life. Too many men are being driven to become government-fearing and time-serving because the Government is being permitted to strike out at those who are fearless enough to think as they please and say what they think. This trend must be halted if we are to keep faith with the Founders of our Nation and pass on to future generations of Americans the great heritage of freedom which they sacrificed so much to leave to us. The choice is clear to me. If we are to pass on that great heritage of freedom, we must return to the original language of the Bill of Rights. We must not be afraid to be free. (Footnotes removed) Justice Black's dissent In re Anastaplo would \"immortalize Anastaplo\", said Justice Brennan upon reading it. Black's dissent was read at Black's funeral, by his instructions. Although he had lost the case, he became a figure of American liberty everywhere. He was described as the 'Socrates of Chicago'. He spoke all around the country about the importance of liberties. He taught liberal arts courses for nearly sixty years at the University of Chicago's Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies. He also taught at Rosary College and the University of Dallas. He eventually became a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. He also authored a number of books that outline his experience and the impact of it. Anastaplo, a resident of Hyde Park, Chicago, died February 14, 2014 of prostate cancer. He was survived by his wife of 65 years, Sara Jacqueline Prince Anastaplo, four children (Helen Scharbach Newlin (nee Helen Margaret Anastaplo), George Malcolm Davidson Anastaplo, Miriam Irene Redleaf (nee Sara Maria Anastaplo), and Theodora McShan Anastaplo), and eight grandchildren.

Anderle graduated in June 1955 from Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, where his schoolmates included Herb Alpert, Jerry Moss, and producer Shel Talmy. In 1964 he began working in A&R at MGM Records, which also owned the Verve label, and convinced the label to sign Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention in 1965. He also worked as the manager of Van Dyke Parks, and helped the Beach Boys establish their own label, Brother Records. Anderle was the first to allege, in print, that the remark \"don't fuck with the formula\" was spoken by Beach Boy Mike Love. He moved to Elektra Records in 1968, and worked with such acts as Judy Collins, David Ackles, the Doors and Love. In 1970 he joined A&M Records, working as a staff producer and A&R person for the company set up by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss. His production credits include albums for Rita Coolidge, Amy Grant, Delaney and Bonnie, Kris Kristofferson, Aaron Neville, Chris De Burgh, Rhinoceros, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Doc Holliday and the Circle Jerks.

An expert in numerous scientific disciplines, Anderson's work combined seismology, solid state physics, geochemistry and petrology to explain how the Earth works. Anderson was best known for his contributions to the understanding of the Earth's deep interior, and more recently, for the hypothesis that hotspots are the product of plate tectonics rather than narrow plumes emanating from the deep Earth. Anderson was Professor (Emeritus) of Geophysics in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He received numerous awards from geophysical, geological and astronomical societies. In 1998 he was awarded the prestigious Crafoord Prize by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences along with Adam Dziewonski. Later that year, Anderson received the National Medal of Science. He held honorary doctorates from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (where he did his undergraduate work in geology and geophysics) and the University of Paris (Sorbonne), and served on numerous university advisory committees, including those at Harvard, Princeton, Yale, University of Chicago, Stanford, University of Paris, Purdue University, and Rice University. Anderson's wide-ranging research resulted in hundreds of published papers in the fields of planetary science, seismology, mineral physics, petrology, geochemistry, tectonics and the philosophy of science. He continued to work and publish until his death. His widely known textbooks, Theory of the Earth, and New Theory of the Earth are regarded by colleagues as compelling syntheses of the origins of the Earth and its inner workings by one of the great geophysical authorities of our time. Born in Frederick, Maryland in 1933, Anderson moved to Baltimore when he was six. He graduated from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute then attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) where he earned a Bachelor of Science in geology and geophysics in 1955. He then worked in the oil industry in California, Montana and Wyoming, and served in the Air Force in Massachusetts and Thule, Greenland before moving to California, where he received a Ph. D. in geophysics and mathematics at Caltech in 1962. He spent most of his subsequent academic career at Caltech's Seismological Laboratory, becoming its second longest serving director from 1967 to 1989. He was married to Nancy Ruth Anderson, had two children, Lynn Anderson Rodriguez and Lee Weston Anderson, and four granddaughters. Anderson began his scientific career while serving in the U. S. Air Force. In Greenland, he studied the properties of sea ice. Anderson was charged with determining whether the ice was strong enough to withstand the landing of heavy aircraft. In working with his colleague, Dr. Wilford Weeks, on scientific papers resulting from the research, it became clear to Anderson that he needed more education. He chose to attend Caltech in geophysics. Anderson's thesis focused on the anisotropic, or directionally dependent, properties of the mantle. It analyzed wave propagation in layered complex media. Prior to Anderson's work, seismologists had assumed that the Earth's interior behaved like glass, and was isotropic. After completing his Ph. D. in 1962, Anderson joined the faculty at Caltech and moved on to other areas of study, writing papers on the composition, physical state, and origin of the Earth as well as other planets. Much later in his career, he returned to the effects of anisotropy and partial melting and the presence of fluids in the upper mantle. He and his colleagues developed methods for taking into account anisotropy and the non-elastic behavior of seismic waves to explain how the Earth works. The technical terms for the subjects of his studies are anharmonicity, asphericity, anelasticity, as well as anisotrophy. In other words, the Earth is not an ideal, elastic sphere. During his more than 50-year career, Anderson published papers on the composition and origin of the Moon, Venus and Mars as well as Earth. He was a principal investigator on the Viking mission to Mars in 1971. Anderson and his collaborators investigated the relations between the behavior of mantle rock under high pressures and temperatures, phase transformations of mantle minerals, and the generation of earthquakes. They contributed significantly to the understanding of tectonic plate motions by mapping convection currents in the Earth's mantle using seismological methods. These studies led to the development of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM), which provides standard values for Earth's important properties, including seismic velocities, density, pressure, attenuation, and anisotropy as a function of planetary radius and wavelength. PREM is now the standard reference model for the Earth. This work was cited when Anderson, along with his colleague Adam Dziewonskiof Harvard University, were awarded the Crafoord Prize in 1998 in Sweden. By taking into account the physics and thermodynamics of Earth materials under the high temperature and pressure conditions in the deep interior, Anderson developed theories that depart from mainstream scientific speculations. In particular, Anderson showed that the standard geochemical and evolutionary models for the Earth are flawed because they violate the laws of thermodynamics in ways that would make Earth behave as a perpetual motion machine. Anderson likened these models to Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u201cJust-So Stories,\u201d and pointed out that these flawed theories are perpetuated when counterveiling evidence is explained away as anomalies or paradoxes. Anderson's models are based on physics and thermodynamics as well as geophysics, and stand up to observations and evidence-based tests. Anderson developed an alternative model of the mineralogical and isotopic composition of the mantle. The Earth had a high-temperature origin and has been chemically stratified since it accreted 4. 5 billion years ago. Conventional scientific wisdom is that the entire mantle is largely made up of olivine-dominated peridotite, some of it primordial material. Anderson, on the other hand, showed that the mid-mantle is composed of piclogite, a pyroxene and garnet-rick rock. Counter to prevailing scientific views, Anderson argued that the deeper layers of the mantle are dense and refractory and unable to rise to the surface or to produce basalts. Anderson suggested that all basalts are produced in the upper mantle. These ideas evolved from the integration of geochemistry, petrology, seismology, and thermodynamics, while standard models are based only on one or two of these disciplines and many assumptions. Anderson also challenged traditional scientific views on how volcanoes are formed, particularly, the theory of convective mantle plumes in the Earth, as proposed by W. Jason Morgan, Anderson argued that the so-called mantle plume hypothesis is invalid and that hotspots and oceanic islands such as Hawaii or Iceland are, instead, the normal products of plate tectonics. While many geochemists believe that volcanoes stem from narrow plumes coming up from just above the Earth's core, Anderson showed that they can be explained entirely by chemical and mineralogical anomalies in the upper mantle. Moreover, Anderson pointed out that all demonstrations of the mantle plume hypothesis violate the basic laws of thermodynamics because they rely on a constant supply of heat coming from the deep Earth or even from outside the Earth. Anderson, on the other hand, accepted the classical view that the Earth's interior is cooling and that volcanoes simply tap a layer of melted rock that exists in the upper mantle, or outer shell of the Earth. It is through the movement of the plates that the magma is allowed to reach the surface through fracture zones, rifts, volcanoes and so-called hot spots. Anderson also considered that plate tectonics is a natural result of a planet being cooled from above. Although his work was based on seismology, classical physics and thermodynamics as well as his knowledge of the Earth's interior, Anderson's theories are considered to be controversial because they depart from the prevailing ideas developed by the geochemical community and which are widely cited in influential publications such as Nature and Science. An active website, mantleplumes. org, is devoted to the challenge by Anderson and his colleagues to standard, or text-book explanations of volcanoes and Earth dynamics. Anderson's multidisciplinary approach, combined with his expertise in geophysics, geochemistry, solid-state physics, and thermodynamics, enabled him to explain the evolution and structure of the Earth in ways that challenge accepted ideas of his time. Colleague Seth Stein of Northwestern University said of Anderson's New Theory of the Earth: \u201cAn old adage says that there are no true students of the Earth because we dig our small holes and sit in them. This book is a striking counter example that synthesizes a broad range of topics dealing with the planet\u2019s structure, evolution, and dynamics. Even readers who disagree with some of the arguments will find them insightful and stimulating. \u201d Anderson died in Cambria, California on December 2, 2014 from cancer, at the age of 81. Showed that anisotropy and anelasticity were important in the propagation of seismic waves in the Earth. Introduced frequency dependent and polarization effects into modern seismology. This made it possible to resolve discrepancies between various types of seismic data (body waves, normal models; Rayleigh-Love wave discrepancy) and to combine all types of data into a single inversion. Developed theory for frequency dependence of both wavespeeds and anelasticity (Q) and applied this to the mantle and core (Absorption Band Model). Developed methods for inverting surface waves for anisotropic structures (Universal Dispersion Curves). Showed (with Minster) how microphysics could explain how short period phenomena could be related to long term rheology. With Nataf, Nakanishi, Tanimoto, Montagner, Regan developed first 3D structures of the anisotropic mantle. James B.

Originally a lock, Anderson represented Bay of Plenty at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, in 1960, playing as a prop. He played 10 matches for the All Blacks but did not make any test appearances. He later became the coach of the Bay of Plenty team, taking them to the inaugural NPC first division title in 1976. \"Photograph of Eric Anderson\". Alexander Turnbull Library. 1960. "}, {"text": "Gerald Michael \"Gerry\" Anderson (28 October 1944 \u2013 21 August 2014), was a radio and television broadcaster for BBC Northern Ireland. Renowned for his unique style and distinctive sense of humour, Anderson often referred to himself on his show, as \"Turkey Neck\", \"Puppet Chin\" or \"Golf Mike Alpha\". Anderson was born in Derry in 1944, growing up in Sackville Street in the city centre. He was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers and went to work as an apprentice tool-maker and a clerk in a shipping firm. In 1963, having taught himself the guitar, he moved to Manchester where he worked in nightclubs. A tour of Scotland, England and Canada followed, with the showband The Chessmen. In 1972, while in Canada, Anderson joined a band called Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks. He returned to Ireland where he gained a degree in sociology and social anthropology, and a postgraduate diploma in continuing education. Anderson began his radio career at BBC Radio Foyle in 1985, the local station in his home city which he usually called \"Stroke City\" to reflect the difficulty regarding broadcasting the name of Derry/Londonderry (each name is preferred by a different part of the local community, Derry by Catholics/Nationalists, Londonderry by Protestants/Unionists). Starting with Making the Tea, on with music but then also moving on to talk shows. His programme was picked up by BBC Radio Ulster and given a wider audience. The Gerry Anderson Show was broadcast daily on BBC Radio Ulster from 10:30 am to 11:55 am, and calls made to the show form the basis of BBC NI's animated TV comedy series On The Air. Show regulars included Geordie Tuft a farmer from Loughbrickland, who offered advice to listeners on matters regarding farm animals (particularly goats), using Jeyes Fluid as a shampoo for dogs, and how to \"dung out a bed\". Anderson was also instrumental in helping to launch the radio career of Paul McLoone, the frontman with the Northern Irish pop-punk group The Undertones and subsequently a radio presenter with the Irish national independent radio station, Today FM. On the BBC Radio Ulster show, referring to his earlier career in music, he claimed to have met Elvis Presley and toured with Kris Kristofferson. His co-presenter on the show was Sean Coyle who has his own Wee Show on BBC Radio Foyle. In addition, Anderson presented various television series for BBC Northern Ireland, including a documentary on hair-loss called Gerry Anderson's Losing It. In 2013, Anderson was also the \"monumental\" guest on Northern Ireland-based comedy panel show, Monumental. His contribution to solving the Derry/Londonderry name dispute was to popularise the jocular name \"Stroke City\" (from the \"/\" in the city's neutral designation), which became the title of one of his radio programmes from 1992 leading some of his friends to rename him \"Gerry/Londongerry\". The programmes were broadcast nationally on Radio 4. In 1994, BBC Radio 4 contracted the broadcaster to present an afternoon magazine programme running from 3 to 4 pm. The audience reaction to Anderson Country was polarised with listeners divided over its shift in tone from the rest of Radio 4. After a year Anderson Country was dropped, although the programme continued as The Afternoon Shift for another three years presented by Laurie Taylor and Daire Brehan. Anderson returned to Northern Ireland where he remained popular, sometimes presenting television as well as radio, and continued to make new programmes for Radio 4 such as Gerry's Bar.

The main entrance to the cathedral was directly below us and therefore out of sight. When a particular service called for the local bishop to enter in some splendour, we were required to sing the celebratory hymn 'Ecce Sacerdos', which I quickly realised was the bishop's 'signature' tune. When it was time for his glorious entry, the worker-bee priest at the altar, seemingly involved in communication with the Higher One, was, in fact, informing the organist via a series of complicated hand signals (observed through the wing mirrors on the organ) of the progress of the bishop. When the proper psychological moment arrived to give the bishop's entry maximum clout, a signal was made, the organ blared majestically, and we lustily sang our hearts out for the benefit of the fat prelate who strode airily down the aisle whilst the lumpen proletariat clamoured to clutch the hem of his raiment. In a flash I realised that this wasn't religion at all. It was show business. (extract from Surviving Stroke City by Gerry Anderson) Autobiography: Surviving Stroke City (Hutchinson, 1999).

Anderson was born near Olathe, Kansas, to John and Ora Bookout Anderson. He graduated from Olathe High School in 1935. From there he went on to Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science, and later transferred to the University of Kansas. In 1943 he graduated from the University of Kansas, and from the University of Kansas Law School the following year. He did not qualify for military service during World War II for physical reasons. Instead, he spent two years, from 1944 to 1946, on the staff of Federal Judge Walter A. Huxman. Later in 1946, Anderson opened his own law practice in Olathe. Soon after establishing his law practice, Anderson entered politics by running for county attorney of Johnson County as a Republican. Anderson won this election, as well as two following elections and served in this capacity until 1953. Beginning in 1952, Anderson sought to elevate his political career by running for a seat in the Kansas State Senate. Again he was successful, holding his office until March 1, 1956. At that time, he was appointed to fill the unexpired term as attorney general. Once in this elective office, Anderson won the two following elections in 1956 and 1958. By 1960, Anderson was ready for bigger ambitions and entered the race for the office of governor in the election of that year. He defeated the Democratic incumbent, George Docking, 511,534 to 402,261 (the Prohibition candidate received 8,727). In keeping with his tradition for winning elections in pairs, Anderson also won the 1962 Gubernatorial election. Anderson became the first governor of Kansas to occupy Cedar Crest which had just been renovated at a cost of one hundred thousand dollars. In 1964, Anderson chose not to seek re-election, but instead, went back to his law practice in Olathe. He remained active in public service after leaving the governor's office, serving as an attorney for the Board of Healing Arts and the Kansas Turnpike Authority. In addition, he served as the director of the Citizens' Conference on State Legislatures from 1965 to 1972. He was nominated for federal judgeships on a number of occasions, but was never appointed. Again, in 1972 he tried for the Republican Party nomination for governor, but was defeated by Morris Kay. After leaving the Governor's office, Anderson retired to his native Olathe.

He later attended the naval pre-flight school in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He married Lillian Anderson. They lived in Bridgehampton, Long Island, New York and owned houses in Vero Beach, Florida and Greenwich, Connecticut. He died at a nursing home in Vero Beach, Florida on September 29, 2014. The Bhopal disaster took place in a plant belonging to Union Carbide's (UCC) Indian subsidiary, Union Carbide India Limited, in the city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India during 1984. Thousands of people died and thousands more were injured in the disaster. As the UCC CEO, Anderson was charged with manslaughter by Indian authorities. He flew to India and was promptly placed in custody by Indian authorities, but was allowed to return to the United States. He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Bhopal on February 1, 1992, for failing to appear at the court hearings in a culpable homicide case. A formal extradition request was issued in 2003. The United States declined to extradite him citing a lack of evidence. The chief judicial magistrate of Bhopal issued an arrest warrant for Anderson on July 31, 2009.

Michaela Christine \"Christel\" And\u00f6rfer, the third of her parents' seven recorded children, was born at Cottbus and grew up nearby D\u00f6bern, a small but long established town a short distance to the north of Germany's frontier with Czechoslovakia. The little town had carved itself a niche as a centre for the manufacture of \"table glass\" - cut-to size sheet glass used to protect the surfaces of valuable tables. The family was a traditional Catholic one. Michaela's father, who had originally immigrated from Bohemia, worked as table glass grinder, a trade into which his daughter followed him after leaving elementary school. When she was sixteen the war ended and the family found themselves living in the Soviet occupation zone. The Polish frontier was suddenly just a couple of hours walk to the east. The And\u00f6rfers were also involved in agriculture, and during the years of reconstruction and land reform that accompanied Soviet occupation, Christel And\u00f6rfer joined in the farming work, \"driving a tractor, and able to handle horses, pigs and cows like no one else\", according to a later interview with her ninety-six-year-old mother. As she grew up she was familiar from as far back as her time in Kindergarten with the Sisters of Hedwig (\"Hedwigschwestern\") who ran a branch in D\u00f6bern. The sisters were a religious order with a particular focus on praising God, and on support for children and adolescents suffering from cognitive, emotional or social impairments. In the words of a senior member of the order, Christel And\u00f6rfer experienced for herself \"the selflessness, the willingness to provide hands-on help and the trust in God [on which the sisters prided themselves] during the war years and postwar period\". One day in 1949 she asked her family if they could imagine her becoming nun. This was interpreted as a statement of intent, masquerading unconvincingly as a tactful question. On 13 June 1950 she was admitted as a novitiate to the Hedwig sisters' principal establishment at Berlin-Wannsee. She then took her religious vows irrevocably in 1957. During her probationary period she attended a music conservatory, learning both music and Montessori teaching methods. She became known among the sisters as an organist. She also learned many of the craft skills which she would be able to apply to teaching mentally impaired children. Her inputs to the construction of the order's Sancta Maria Remedial Children's' Home and of the school attached to it in Berlin-Wannsee were decisive. In 1969 Sister Michaela was elected (Superior general \"Generaloberin\") of the Sisters of Hedwig (\"Hedwigschwestern\"). It was the first change at the top since before the Second World War, and she herself retained the post till 2005. Her predecessor, Sister Augustina Schmidt, was by this time very old, and died only two years after Sister Michaela's appointment, which got her own time as leader of the order off to a particularly challenging start. In 1986, at the request of the Berlin senate, she took on the care of a group of HIV-positive babies and infants. At the time this was considered more noteworthy at the time than subsequently, because of the hysterical insecurities and reactions unleashed by any public discussion of HIV/AIDS. After relinquishing her position as (Superior general of the Sisters of Hedwig in 2005, Sister Michaela assumed a new leadership role in 2011 when she took on the role of the Hedwigs' Provincial superior (\"Provinzialoberin \") for the Germany Province. Sister Maria Michaela was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic \"am Bande\" on 9 September 1998.

He was arrested after the 1989 overthrow of the Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu regime. Andrei was born to a very poor family in Oltenia, where the Romanian communist leader Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu was also from. While a child he was a shepherd but willing to continue his education; he eventually made his way into the leadership of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. His doctoral thesis at the university covered the subject of international communist movements and was later used as reference in the central committee. In one of his articles on socialism he had published a few days before an official visit by the General Secretary of the CP of China, Hu Yaobang, he said: \"The socialist character of one country or another cannot be denied; the socialism built in one country cannot be opposed to the socialism of other countries or to the socialism to be constructed in the future. \" Andrei was often considered a very literate and benevolent man, a famous book collector enriching his collection from his trips abroad. He was also seen as a good husband and family man. He was married to the Romanian movie actress Violeta Andrei. Andrei was first appointed Deputy Chief of the International Section of the Central Committee and encouraged to develop ties with foreign communist governments and movements around the world . Then in April 1972, he became the Secretary for Foreign Relations of the Central Committee and in November 1974, he rose to membership on the Permanent Bureau of the Political Executive Committee of Romania. On 8 March 1978 he was eventually appointed the Minister of Foreign Affairs. As a Minister, Andrei attempted to decrease dependence of Romania on Soviet Union by directing its foreign policy towards developing ASEAN countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand while also enhancing trade, economic and educational exchange with African countries of Guinea, Gabon, Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Burundi, Sudan and Zaire which also diversified Romania's energy imports. During his years in service to the Ceau\u0219escu regime, he was also a personal advisor to the younger son of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, Nicu Ceau\u0219escu. His term as the Minister of Foreign Affairs ended on 11 November 1985 when he was reportedly sacked by the First Lady Elena Ceau\u0219escu who then appointed her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Ilie V\u0103duva to take over.

From 1972 to 1996, he was the Rector of St. Thomas' Church on New York's Fifth Avenue. Andrew was born on 10 January 1931 in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England. As a boy, he was a chorister at St Peters Church, Anlaby. He was educated at Beverley Grammar School, an all-boys school in Beverley, Yorkshire. Having served in the Royal Air Force for 18 months as part of National Service, he was awarded a scholarship to the University of Oxford. He studied theology at Keble College, Oxford. He entered Cuddesdon College, an Anglican theological college in the Catholic tradition, in 1954 to train for ordination to the priesthood. He graduated from Keble College with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1955; as per tradition, this was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree in 1958. He then completed a further year of study at Cuddesdon before his ordination. On 9 March 1950, having completed officer training, Andrew was commissioned into the Secretarial Branch of the Royal Air Force as a pilot officer (national service). On 18 September 1951, after 18 months with the RAF, he was transferred to the reserve (national Service list) thereby ending his full-time service. He was promoted to flying officer on 4 June 1952. On 27 May 1956, he relinquished his commission and therefore ended his call-up liability. In 1956, Andrew was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon by Michael Ramsey, then the Archbishop of York, at York Minster. He was ordained as a priest in 1957. From 1956 to 1959, he served his curacy at St Peter's Church, Redcar. In 1959, he moved to the United States for the first time and was curate at St. George's-by-the-River, Rumson, New Jersey for approximately 18 months. In October 1960, Andrew returned to England and was appointed chaplain to Michael Ramsey, then the Archbishop of York. From 1961 to 1969, he continued to serve as chaplain to Ramsey, now the Archbishop of Canterbury. His time as chaplain to Ramsey was controversial given his unusually young age (he was 30 when Ramsey became Archbishop of Canterbury) and because he had only ever been a curate (a junior parish priest). He was promoted to Senior Chaplain in 1965. Andrew then moved back into parish ministry and from 1969 to 1972 served as Vicar of Church of St John the Evangelist, Preston, Lancashire. This appointment did not suit him; it was much less prestigious than that of chaplain to an archbishop and could be seen as a demotion. From 1970 to 1972, he was additionally Rural Dean of Preston, giving him a supervising role over 39 other priests. After three years, he sought a more prestigious appointment and made use of the influential contacts he had gained during his time as archbishop's chaplain. In March 1972, the vestry of St Thomas' Church, New York City, United States, choose Andrew as their next rector. He had been recommended by a group of wealthy American women who formed part of the influential network he had built up. On 3 December 1972, he was instituted as the 11th Rector by Paul Moore, Jr. , the Bishop of New York. His first act was to change the main Sunday service from Morning Prayer to a Eucharist and he extended this to daily Mass throughout the year. He also introduced incense to services, icons and Reservation of the Blessed Sacrament. There were attempts to lure him back to England with the offer of the appointment of Vicar of Tewkesbury Abbey, but he turned it down. On 29 January 1995, he was made an honorary canon of the Cathedral of St John the Divine, New York, by Richard F. Grein, Bishop of New York. Andrew retired in 1996 and returned for a time to England. He later returned to New York and was appointed Rector Emeritus of St Thomas' Church in 1999. On 15 October 2014, Andrew was having dinner with John O'Hara, the newly appointed Roman Catholic Auxiliary Bishop of New York, when he had a heart attack. He was taken to the New York Presbyterian Hospital but died on 17 October. His funeral was held at St. Thomas' Church, New York, on 5 November. In the 1996 New Year Honours, Andrew was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) 'for charitable and community services in New York'. In May 1996, he was awarded the Cross of St Augustine, the second highest honour for service to Anglicanism, by George Carey, the then Archbishop of Canterbury.

Andrews (first name pronounced SER CEE) was born in Lubbock to Curcy Andrews, Sr. , originally from Honey Grove in Fannin County in northeast Texas, and the former Ollie Lee Townsend (1907\u20131993), who grew up on a ranch in Plains near Brownfield in West Texas. Andrews graduated in 1958 from Monterey High School, one of his classmates having been the actor Barry Corbin. He attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock, but did not graduate. He then launched his broadcasting career at the age of 20 in October 1960. He has been affiliated with stations KSEL AM 950, KLLL AM 1460, KKAM AM 1340, KCBD AM 1590, and KFYO AM 790, where for 16 years he was both program director and music director. He spent six years as general manager and co-host of the \"Big Ed in the Morning Show\" with Edwin \"Big Ed\" Wilkes on KRFE AM 580. In addition to his morning show, Andrews also voiced many commercials carried on KDAV. Andrews and Wilkes were the first producers ever to place Clower on a record. Originally a fertilizer salesman, Andrews spotted Clower as he spoke to a luncheon group in Lubbock, and suggested that the fledgling comedian cut a record of his monologue. The result was Clower's The Coon Hunt on MCA Records, which was later awarded a platinum album for sales in excess of $1 million at the retail level. Andrews handled Clower's first five albums. In 1975, Andrews produced Phone Call from God by Jerry Jordan, a gospel singer from Brownfield, the seat of Terry County west of Lubbock. This recording subsequently received a gold record from MCA, the recognition of the sale of one million records. Jordan is also an artist; he maintains a gallery in Taos, New Mexico. Thereafter, through Southern Track Records of Atlanta, Andrews produced Robert W. \"Bob\" Murphey, an attorney and country comedian from Nacogdoches in East Texas. Murphey, a nephew of former Texas Governor Coke R. Stevenson, was also a former sergeant-at-arms of the Texas House of Representatives. After the Lubbock Tornado on May 11, 1970, Andrews, while at KFYO, was awarded a citation from U. S. President Richard M. Nixon for outstanding public service during the disaster. Radio station ownership Andrews was a partner-founder (along with Billy B. Reynolds, Charles \"Charlie\" Wilson, and DRA, Inc. , which included the Brownfield lawyer Jim Rudd), in the Brownfield FM now known as 104. 3 KTTU-FM. The application was filed in mid-1980 and granted after a hearing in 1984. The station signed on as KKTC, and the company was known as BBC Brownfield Broadcasting Company. Andrews and Reynolds had worked at KFYO (AM) and had noticed that the former news director of KLVT (AM), Del Kirby, had started a station called KHOC (FM), now KJDL-FM, in Levelland in Hockley County west of Lubbock. The two broadcasters offered to buy the station, but were unsuccessful. Other staff at KFYO (Roger Hiveley or Chuck Kinney, or perhaps David Stewart, who is known to have worked at KFYO in this time frame) made them aware of other FM outlets available in other towns, Ralls, Floydada, and Brownfield. Of those choices, Brownfield was the largest community. KKTC went on air with a country format and studio on the square in Brownfield. The initial ownership was Bud Andrews and Bill Reynolds, each with 26% interest. Charlie Wilson, an electronics teacher at Lubbock Independent School District and the founder of KLSD (FM) (now KOHM) and the engineer who combined KJAK and KHOC, held 24%. So did DRA, Inc. , which included partners of the law firm of Jim Rudd, a Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1977 to 1995. The station was not an instant success because start-up costs were much higher than expected. Partners expected to come up with necessary equipment underperformed, and the two partners who actually worked at the station disagreed on operating policy, whether to live in the town and how to sell ads on the station. Reynolds soon bought out Andrews' interest. Wilson was bought out by a man named Dennison whose son worked at the station and had a car dealership in Hobbs, New Mexico. About a year later, Dennison bought out Reynolds and then held some three-fourths of the station. Andrews returned to KFYO as program director and worked there throughout the 1980s. Andrews was formerly teamed with William Ralph \"Bill\" Clement (born 1948), on the \"Bud and Billy C. Show\" on KDAV on weekdays from 6 to 9 am. Andrews retired in October 2010 after 51 years in broadcasting and record production. On March 15, 2008, Andrews was featured on a segment of Bob Phillips's television series Texas Country Reporter, with the emphasis on the discovery of Jerry Clower and the recording of The Coon Hunt by Clower in Hollywood. Andrews received a platinum album for sales exceeding one million units. He married and later divorced the former Shirley Herndon. The couple has three children.

He is the former President of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers in the Roman Curia, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1991. When Cardinal Ersilio Tonini died on 28 July 2013, Cardinal Angelini became the oldest living cardinal until the next consistory where Pope Francis appointed 98-year-old Archbishop Loris Francesco Capovilla as a cardinal. Born in Rome, Angelini studied at the Pontifical Roman Seminary, Pontifical Lateran University, and Pontifical Theological Faculty Marianum before being ordained to the priesthood on 3 February 1940. He did pastoral work in Rome until 1956, and served as a chaplain in Azione Cattolica from 1945 to 1959. Angelini served as Master of Pontifical Ceremonies from 1947 to 1954, and for a few months he was a delegate for Roman hospitals. On 27 June 1956, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Messene by Pope Pius XII. Angelini received his episcopal consecration on 29 July from Cardinal Giuseppe Pizzardo, with Archbishop Luigi Traglia and Bishop Ismaele Castellano serving as co-consecrators. He founded, in 1959, the Italian Catholic Doctors' Association, and attended the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965). On 6 January 1977, Pope Paul VI named him an Auxiliary Bishop of Rome. Pope John Paul II raised him to the rank of Archbishop and appointed him as the first president of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers on 16 February 1985. He was created Cardinal-Deacon of Santo Spirito in Sassia by John Paul II in the consistory of 28 June 1991. Due to his responsibility for the health of the Vatican (head of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers, 1985\u20131996), which made him the leader of 3,000 institutions in Italy alone, Angelini (nicknamed Sua Sanit\u00e0) was involved in the Tangentopoli bribery scandal of the early 1990s. Accusations against him included the forced acceptance of his own people for public commissions, as well as extortion from a pharmaceutical company. Angelini was not prosecuted, due to the Vatican's extraterritorial privileges granted by the Lateran Pacts. Angelini was near to Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democracy (DC) politician who was several times Prime Minister of Italy, and whose entourage fell from power in the same period by similar scandals (Andreotti himself was put on trial for associations with the mafia). Angelini celebrated the marriage of the daughter of Paolo Cirino Pomicino, another DC politician involved in the bribery scandals; the marriage was attended, amongst others, by Andreotti, Gianni De Michelis (also put on trial in the Tangentopoli scandal) and minister Francesco De Lorenzo, who was condemned to 5 years imprisonment for bribery in the management of Italy's Public Health sector. Angelini lost his right to vote in papal conclaves when he turned 80 on 1 August 1996. He retired as President of Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers on 31 December 1996, and on 26 February 2002, he exercised the right of becoming a Cardinal Priest after ten years as a Cardinal Deacon. Angelini has called for the opening of a cause for the beatification of French geneticist J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lejeune. In 1997 Angelini formed the International Institute for Research on the Face of Christ in Rome in association with the Sisters of the Reparation of the Holy Face. On 28 July 2013, day of the death of cardinal Ersilio Tonini, he became the oldest cardinal in the world. However, Loris Francesco Capovilla, who was elevated to cardinal on 22 February 2014, was older. Angelini was a lifelong admirer of the late Pope Pius XII. In 1959, Angelini published the medical theological pronouncement of the late Pope, the only systematic compilation of the medical speeches and positions of Pope Pius XII, in Pio XII Discorsi Ai Medici and went on to champion his cause for canonization. Angelini was appointed bishop by Pius XII in 1956, but did not get the galero (red hat) until 1991. In a 1992 sermon in Saint Peter Basilica on the anniversary of the death of the pontiff, Angelini stated that his career had suffered because of his positive views of Pope Pius XII.

He was born in Norton St Philip, Somerset and died at Bath, Somerset. A right-handed opening batsman, Angell made a lot of runs in club cricket for the Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath, but his record in first-class cricket was less successful. He played for Somerset in matches at Bath in both 1947 and 1948, and in a few more games in 1949, before joining the county club's staff in 1950. Playing mostly as the opening partner to the ebullient Harold Gimblett, Angell was a restrained, neat batsman and made 933 runs in his first full season, though his average was only 20 and he passed 50 only three times. There was a very similar record in 1951, with 975 runs, again at an average of 20. In 1952, Angell made his highest score of 90 in the match against Derbyshire at Derby. But three weeks later he was dropped from the side and, as Somerset hit the bottom of the County Championship table for what would prove to be the first of four consecutive last-place finishes, he was not re-engaged at the end of the 1952 season. In 1954, however, with Gimblett retiring suddenly at the start of the season, Angell was recalled to Somerset and proceeded to have his best season in first-class cricket. He scored 1,125 runs at an average of 22. 95 and made his highest score (and only first-class century) of 114 in the match against the Pakistanis. Apart from this innings, his highest score for the season was an unbeaten 62. He was less successful again in 1955, and after seven matches in 1956 he left the staff for good. He continued to be a heavy scorer in club cricket into his late 40s. By profession, he was an engineering draughtsman for a Bath company. He died on 9 October 2014.

He was professor at the School of Byzantine Chant at the Conservatory of Athens, the founder and director of the Greek Byzantine Choir and an Archon Protopsaltes (lead protopsaltes) of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Lykourgos A. Angelopoulos was born in Pyrgos, Peloponnese, in 1941. He studied Byzantine music at the School of National Music, under the tutelage of the great musician and musicologist, Simon Karas, and Law at the University of Athens. He was the protopsaltes (first cantor) at the Church of Saint Irene in Athens (first Cathedral). He was the founder and director of the Greek Byzantine Choir and professor of Byzantine Music at the Nikos Skalkotas Conservatory and at the Philippos Nakas Conservatory in Athens. He was the director of the Children's Byzantine Choir of the Archdiocese of Athens since its foundation and the director of the School of Byzantine Music at the Diocese of Elis. Lykourgos Angelopoulos had published his own editions according to the re-introduction of signs taken from Late Byzantine notation. Simon Karas translated them within the rhythmic context of Neo-Byzantine notation as ornaments. Concerning performance practice, the choir follows Karas' innovations and his interpretation of the Byzantine modes, due to Lykourgos Angelopoulos' use of the \"extended\" neumatic notation in his own hand-written chant editions. In a contribution to a musicological conference at Delphi (1986), Lykourgos Angelopoulos explained his attitude to the living tradition and to the New Method in general, and editions based on Simon Karas' Method in particular. He died at the age of 73 on 18 May 2014. He had collaborated with the Athens Radio Broadcast on programs related to Byzantine Music and had performed contemporary music composed by M. Adamis, D. Terzakis and K. Sfetsas. He was a member of the research team headed by Marcel P\u00e9r\u00e8s in France, which studies the old Western chants and their relationship to the Byzantine ones. He had performed Byzantine, Old Roman, Ambrosian and other traditions of Western plainchant in recordings with the Ensemble Organum in France. In 1994 Lykourgos Angelopoulos was honored by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I with the Patriarchal offikion and was named Archon Protopsaltis (First Chanter) of the Holy Archdiocese of Constantinople. He had also been honored by Diodoros, Patriarch of Jerusalem, by the Orthodox Church of Finland and by the Diocese of Patras in Greece. Lykourgos had especially influenced Georgios Konstantinou, who proposed a notation for microtonal shifts (melodic attraction) and notated details, which had previously been part of oral tradition. The advantage of the oral tradition is that only those singers who had been introduced by their masters, followed a certain local tradition. The Balkans and the Orient are still rich of these local traditions. Lykourgos Angelopoulos was well known for his international collaborations, e. g. with Divna Ljubojevi\u0107, and as a charismatic singer who had a large following. He had faced strong opposition among psaltes who belong to these local traditions. Angelopoulos, Lykourgos (1986). Terzopoulos, Konstantinos (ed. ).

She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim. She became a poet and writer after a series of occupations as a young adult, including fry cook, sex worker, nightclub dancer and performer, cast member of the opera Porgy and Bess, coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and journalist in Egypt and Ghana during the decolonization of Africa. She was an actress, writer, director, and producer of plays, movies, and public television programs. In 1982, she was named the first Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was active in the Civil Rights Movement and worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Beginning in the 1990s, she made around 80 appearances a year on the lecture circuit, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" (1993) at the first inauguration of Bill Clinton, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961. With the publication of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although attempts have been made to ban her books from some U. S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family and travel. Marguerite Annie Johnson was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 4, 1928, the second child of Bailey Johnson, a doorman and navy dietitian, and Vivian (Baxter) Johnson, a nurse and card dealer. Angelou's older brother, Bailey Jr. , nicknamed Marguerite \"Maya\", derived from \"My\" or \"Mya Sister\". When Angelou was three and her brother four, their parents' \"calamitous marriage\" ended, and their father sent them to Stamps, Arkansas, alone by train, to live with their paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson. In \"an astonishing exception\" to the harsh economics of African Americans of the time, Angelou's grandmother prospered financially during the Great Depression and World War II because the general store she owned sold needed basic commodities and because \"she made wise and honest investments\". Four years later, the children's father \"came to Stamps without warning\" and returned them to their mother's care in St. Louis. At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told the rest of their family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing, as she stated, \"I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone. \" According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her. Shortly after Freeman's murder, Angelou and her brother were sent back to their grandmother. Angelou credits a teacher and friend of her family, Mrs. Bertha Flowers, with helping her speak again. Flowers introduced her to authors such as Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Douglas Johnson, and James Weldon Johnson, authors who would affect her life and career, as well as black female artists like Frances Harper, Anne Spencer, and Jessie Fauset. When Angelou was 14, she and her brother moved in with their mother once again, who had since moved to Oakland, California. During World War II, Angelou attended the California Labor School. At the age of 16, she became the first black female cable car conductor in San Francisco. She wanted the job badly, admiring the uniforms of the operators \u2014 so much so that her mother referred to it as her \"dream job. \" Her mother encouraged her to pursue the position, but warned her that she would need to arrive early and work harder than others. In 2014, Angelou received a lifetime achievement award from the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials as part of a session billed \u201cWomen Who Move the Nation. \u201dThree weeks after completing school, at the age of 17, she gave birth to her son, Clyde (who later changed his name to Guy Johnson). In 1951, Angelou married Tosh Angelos, a Greek electrician, former sailor, and aspiring musician, despite the condemnation of interracial relationships at the time and the disapproval of her mother. She took modern dance classes during this time, and met dancers and choreographers Alvin Ailey and Ruth Beckford. Ailey and Angelou formed a dance team, calling themselves \"Al and Rita\", and performed modern dance at fraternal black organizations throughout San Francisco, but never became successful. Angelou, her new husband, and her son moved to New York City so she could study African dance with Trinidadian dancer Pearl Primus, but they returned to San Francisco a year later. After Angelou's marriage ended in 1954, she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco, including the nightclub the Purple Onion, where she sang and danced to calypso music. Up to that point she went by the name of \"Marguerite Johnson\", or \"Rita\", but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at the Purple Onion, she changed her professional name to \"Maya Angelou\" (her nickname and former married surname). It was a \"distinctive name\" that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances. During 1954 and 1955, Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess. She began her practice of learning the language of every country she visited, and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages. In 1957, riding on the popularity of calypso, Angelou recorded her first album, Miss Calypso, which was reissued as a CD in 1996. She appeared in an off-Broadway review that inspired the 1957 film Calypso Heat Wave, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions. Angelou met novelist John Oliver Killens in 1959 and, at his urging, moved to New York to concentrate on her writing career. She joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met several major African-American authors, including John Henrik Clarke, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, and Julian Mayfield, and was published for the first time. In 1960, after meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and hearing him speak, she and Killens organized \"the legendary\" Cabaret for Freedom to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and she was named SCLC's Northern Coordinator. According to scholar Lyman B. Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and \"eminently effective\". Angelou also began her pro-Castro and anti-apartheid activism during this time. In 1961, Angelou performed in Jean Genet's play The Blacks, along with Abbey Lincoln, Roscoe Lee Brown, James Earl Jones, Louis Gossett, Godfrey Cambridge, and Cicely Tyson. Also in 1961, she met South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make; they never officially married. She and her son Guy moved with Make to Cairo, where Angelou worked as an associate editor at the weekly English-language newspaper The Arab Observer. In 1962, her relationship with Make ended, and she and Guy moved to Accra, Ghana so he could attend college, but he was seriously injured in an automobile accident. Angelou remained in Accra for his recovery and ended up staying there until 1965. She became an administrator at the University of Ghana, and was active in the African-American expatriate community. She was a feature editor for The African Review, a freelance writer for the Ghanaian Times, wrote and broadcast for Radio Ghana, and worked and performed for Ghana's National Theatre. She performed in a revival of The Blacks in Geneva and Berlin. In Accra, she became close friends with Malcolm X during his visit in the early 1960s. Angelou returned to the U. S. in 1965 to help him build a new civil rights organization, the Organization of Afro-American Unity; he was assassinated shortly afterward. Devastated and adrift, she joined her brother in Hawaii, where she resumed her singing career. She moved back to Los Angeles to focus on her writing career. Working as a market researcher in Watts, Angelou witnessed the riots in the summer of 1965. She acted in and wrote plays, and returned to New York in 1967. She met her lifelong friend Rosa Guy and renewed her friendship with James Baldwin, whom she had met in Paris in the 1950s and called \"my brother\", during this time. Her friend Jerry Purcell provided Angelou with a stipend to support her writing. In 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. asked Angelou to organize a march. She agreed, but \"postpones again\", and in what Gillespie calls \"a macabre twist of fate\", he was assassinated on her 40th birthday (April 4). Devastated again, she was encouraged out of her depression by her friend James Baldwin. As Gillespie states, \"If 1968 was a year of great pain, loss, and sadness, it was also the year when America first witnessed the breadth and depth of Maya Angelou's spirit and creative genius\". Despite having almost no experience, she wrote, produced, and narrated Blacks, Blues, Black!, a ten-part series of documentaries about the connection between blues music and black Americans' African heritage, and what Angelou called the \"Africanisms still current in the U. S. \" for National Educational Television, the precursor of PBS. Also in 1968, inspired at a dinner party she attended with Baldwin, cartoonist Jules Feiffer, and his wife Judy, and challenged by Random House editor Robert Loomis, she wrote her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, published in 1969. This brought her international recognition and acclaim. Angelou's Georgia, Georgia, produced by a Swedish film company and filmed in Sweden, the first screenplay written by a black woman, was released in 1972. She also wrote the film's soundtrack, despite having very little additional input in the filming of the movie. Angelou married Paul du Feu, a Welsh carpenter and ex-husband of writer Germaine Greer, in San Francisco in 1973. Over the next ten years, as Gillespie has stated, \"She [Angelou] had accomplished more than many artists hope to achieve in a lifetime. \" Angelou worked as a composer, writing for singer Roberta Flack, and composing movie scores. She wrote articles, short stories, TV scripts, documentaries, autobiographies, and poetry, produced plays, and was named visiting professor at several colleges and universities. She was \"a reluctant actor\", and was nominated for a Tony Award in 1973 for her role in Look Away. As a theater director, in 1988 she undertook a revival of Errol John's play Moon on a Rainbow Shawl at the Almeida Theatre in London. In 1977, Angelou appeared in a supporting role in the television mini-series Roots. She was given a multitude of awards during this period, including over thirty honorary degrees from colleges and universities from all over the world. In the late 1970s, Angelou met Oprah Winfrey when Winfrey was a TV anchor in Baltimore, Maryland; Angelou would later become Winfrey's close friend and mentor. In 1981, Angelou and du Feu divorced. She returned to the southern United States in 1981 because she felt she had to come to terms with her past there and, despite having no bachelor's degree, accepted the lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where she was one of a few full-time African-American professors. From that point on, she considered herself \"a teacher who writes\". Angelou taught a variety of subjects that reflected her interests, including philosophy, ethics, theology, science, theater, and writing. The Winston-Salem Journal reported that even though she made many friends on campus, \"she never quite lived down all of the criticism from people who thought she was more of a celebrity than an intellect. . . [and] an overpaid figurehead\". The last course she taught at Wake Forest was in 2011, but she was planning to teach another course in late 2014. Her final speaking engagement at the university was in late 2013. Beginning in the 1990s, Angelou actively participated in the lecture circuit in a customized tour bus, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at the presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works, and broadened her appeal \"across racial, economic, and educational boundaries\". The recording of the poem won a Grammy Award. In June 1995, she delivered what Richard Long called her \"second 'public' poem\", titled \"A Brave and Startling Truth\", which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. Angelou achieved her goal of directing a feature film in 1996, Down in the Delta, which featured actors such as Alfre Woodard and Wesley Snipes. Also in 1996, she collaborated with R&B artists Ashford & Simpson on seven of the eleven tracks of their album Been Found. The album was responsible for three of Angelou's only Billboard chart appearances. In 2000, she created a successful collection of products for Hallmark, including greeting cards and decorative household items. She responded to critics who charged her with being too commercial by stating that \"the enterprise was perfectly in keeping with her role as 'the people's poet'\". More than thirty years after Angelou began writing her life story, she completed her sixth autobiography A Song Flung Up to Heaven, in 2002. Angelou campaigned for the Democratic Party in the 2008 presidential primaries, giving her public support to Hillary Clinton. In the run-up to the January Democratic primary in South Carolina, the Clinton campaign ran ads featuring Angelou's endorsement. The ads were part of the campaign's efforts to rally support in the Black community; but Barack Obama won the South Carolina primary, finishing 29 points ahead of Clinton and taking 80% of the Black vote. When Clinton's campaign ended, Angelou put her support behind Obama, who went on to win the presidential election and became the first African-American president of the United States. After Obama's inauguration, she stated, \"We are growing up beyond the idiocies of racism and sexism. \"In late 2010, Angelou donated her personal papers and career memorabilia to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. They consisted of more than 340 boxes of documents that featured her handwritten notes on yellow legal pads for I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, a 1982 telegram from Coretta Scott King, fan mail, and personal and professional correspondence from colleagues such as her editor Robert Loomis. In 2011, Angelou served as a consultant for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Washington, D. C. She spoke out in opposition to a paraphrase of a quotation by King that appeared on the memorial, saying, \"The quote makes Dr. Martin Luther King look like an arrogant twit\", and demanded that it be changed. Eventually, the paraphrase was removed. In 2013, at the age of 85, Angelou published the seventh volume of autobiography in her series, titled Mom & Me & Mom, which focuses on her relationship with her mother. Evidence suggests that Angelou was partially descended from the Mende people of West Africa. In 2008, a DNA test revealed that among all of her African ancestors, 45 percent were from the Congo-Angola region and 55 percent were from West Africa. A 2008 PBS documentary found that Angelou's maternal great-grandmother Mary Lee, who had been emancipated after the Civil War, became pregnant by her white former owner, John Savin. Savin forced Lee to sign a false statement accusing another man of being the father of her child. After Savin was indicted for forcing Lee to commit perjury, and despite the discovery that Savin was the father, a jury found him not guilty. Lee was sent to the Clinton County poorhouse in Missouri with her daughter, Marguerite Baxter, who became Angelou's grandmother. Angelou described Lee as \"that poor little Black girl, physically and mentally bruised\". The details of Angelou's life described in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles tended to be inconsistent. Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and \"with no time chart in front of her\". For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified the number of times she had been married, \"for fear of sounding frivolous\"; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade, working as a prostitute and madame for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, \"I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, 'I never did anything wrong. Who, Moi? \u2013 never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet. ' They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn I must be a pretty bad guy. My mom or dad never did anything wrong. ' They can't forgive themselves and go on with their lives. \"Angelou had one son, Guy, whose birth she described in her first autobiography; one grandson, two great-grandchildren, and, according to Gillespie, a large group of friends and extended family. Angelou's mother Vivian Baxter died in 1991 and her brother Bailey Johnson, Jr. , died in 2000 after a series of strokes; both were important figures in her life and her books. In 1981, the mother of her grandson disappeared with him; finding him took four years. In 2009, the gossip website TMZ erroneously reported that Angelou had been hospitalized in Los Angeles when she was alive and well in St. Louis, which resulted in rumors of her death and, according to Angelou, concern among her friends and family worldwide. In 2013, Angelou told her friend Oprah Winfrey that she had studied courses offered by the Unity Church, which were spiritually significant to her. She did not earn a university degree, but according to Gillespie it was Angelou's preference to be called \"Dr. Angelou\" by people outside of her family and close friends. She owned two homes in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and a \"lordly brownstone\" in Harlem, which was purchased in 2004 and was full of her \"growing library\" of books she collected throughout her life, artwork collected over the span of many decades, and well-stocked kitchens. Guardian writer Gary Younge reported that in Angelou's Harlem home were several African wall hangings and her collection of paintings, including ones of several jazz trumpeters, a watercolor of Rosa Parks, and a Faith Ringgold work titled \"Maya's Quilt Of Life\". According to Gillespie, she hosted several celebrations per year at her main residence in Winston-Salem; \"her skill in the kitchen is the stuff of legend\u2014from haute cuisine to down-home comfort food\". The Winston-Salem Journal stated: \"Securing an invitation to one of Angelou's Thanksgiving dinners, Christmas tree decorating parties or birthday parties was among the most coveted invitations in town. \" The New York Times, describing Angelou's residence history in New York City, stated that she regularly hosted elaborate New Year's Day parties. She combined her cooking and writing skills in her 2004 book Hallelujah! The Welcome Table, which featured 73 recipes, many of which she learned from her grandmother and mother, accompanied by 28 vignettes. She followed up in 2010 with her second cookbook, Great Food, All Day Long: Cook Splendidly, Eat Smart, which focused on weight loss and portion control. Beginning with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou used the same \"writing ritual\" for many years. She would wake early in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff was instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and would leave by the early afternoon. She would average 10\u201312 pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. She went through this process to \"enchant\" herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, \"relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang\". She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even traumatic experiences such as her rape in Caged Bird, in order to \"tell the human truth\" about her life. Angelou stated that she played cards in order to get to that place of enchantment and in order to access her memories more effectively. She said, \"It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it\u2014ha! It's so delicious!\" She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in \"telling the truth\". Angelou died on the morning of May 28, 2014. She was found by her nurse. Although Angelou had reportedly been in poor health and had canceled recent scheduled appearances, she was working on another book, an autobiography about her experiences with national and world leaders. During her memorial service at Wake Forest University, her son Guy Johnson stated that despite being in constant pain due to her dancing career and respiratory failure, she wrote four books during the last ten years of her life. He said, \"She left this mortal plane with no loss of acuity and no loss in comprehension. \"Tributes to Angelou and condolences were paid by artists, entertainers, and world leaders, including Obama, whose sister was named after Angelou, and Bill Clinton. Harold Augenbraum, from the National Book Foundation, said that Angelou's \"legacy is one that all writers and readers across the world can admire and aspire to. \" The week after Angelou's death, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings rose to number 1 on Amazon. com's bestseller list. On May 29, 2014, Mount Zion Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, of which Angelou was a member for 30 years, held a public memorial service to honor her. On June 7, a private memorial service was held at Wait Chapel on the campus of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem. The memorial was shown live on local stations in the Winston-Salem/Triad area and streamed live on the university web site with speeches from her son, Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton. On June 15, a memorial was held at Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco, where Angelou was a member for many years. Rev. Cecil Williams, Mayor Ed Lee, and former mayor Willie Brown spoke. Angelou wrote a total of seven autobiographies. According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, Angelou's third autobiography Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas marked the first time a well-known African-American autobiographer had written a third volume about her life. Her books \"stretch over time and place\", from Arkansas to Africa and back to the U. S. , and take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. She published her seventh autobiography Mom & Me & Mom in 2013, at the age of 85. Critics have tended to judge Angelou's subsequent autobiographies \"in light of the first\", with Caged Bird receiving the highest praise. Angelou wrote five collections of essays, which writer Hilton Als called her \"wisdom books\" and \"homilies strung together with autobiographical texts\". Angelou used the same editor throughout her writing career, Robert Loomis, an executive editor at Random House; he retired in 2011 and has been called \"one of publishing's hall of fame editors. \" Angelou said regarding Loomis: \"We have a relationship that's kind of famous among publishers. \" Angelou's long and extensive career also included poetry, plays, screenplays for television and film, directing, acting, and public speaking. She was a prolific writer of poetry; her volume Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971) was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and she was chosen by US President Bill Clinton to recite her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" during his inauguration in 1993. Angelou's successful acting career included roles in numerous plays, films, and television programs, including her appearance in the television mini-series Roots in 1977. Her screenplay, Georgia, Georgia (1972), was the first original script by a black woman to be produced, and she was the first African-American woman to direct a major motion picture, Down in the Delta, in 1998.

According to scholar Hilton Als, up to that point, black female writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote. Linguist John McWhorter agreed, seeing Angelou's works, which he called \"tracts\", as \"apologetic writing\". He placed Angelou in the tradition of African-American literature as a defense of black culture, which he called \"a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period\". Writer Julian Mayfield, who called Caged Bird \"a work of art that eludes description\", argued that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for not only other black women writers, but also African-American autobiography as a whole. Als said that Caged Bird marked one of the first times that a black autobiographer could, as he put it, \"write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense\". Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for blacks and women. It made her \"without a doubt, . . . America's most visible black woman autobiographer\", and \"a major autobiographical voice of the time\". As writer Gary Younge said, \"Probably more than almost any other writer alive, Angelou's life literally is her work. \"Als said that Caged Bird helped increase black feminist writings in the 1970s, less through its originality than \"its resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist\", or the time in which it was written, at the end of the American Civil Rights Movement. Als also claimed that Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, have freed other female writers to \"open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world\". Angelou critic Joanne M. Braxton stated that Caged Bird was \"perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing\" autobiography written by an African-American woman in its era. Angelou's poetry has influenced the modern hip-hop music community, including artists such as Kanye West, Common, Tupac Shakur, and Nicki Minaj. Reviewer Elsie B. Washington, most likely due to President Clinton's choice of Angelou to recite her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at his 1993 inauguration, called her \"the black woman's poet laureate\". Sales of the paperback version of her books and poetry rose by 300\u2013600% the week after Angelou's recitation. Random House, which published the poem later that year, had to reprint 400,000 copies of all her books to keep up with the demand. They sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, accounting for a 1200% increase. Angelou famously said, in response to criticism regarding using the details of her life in her work, \"I agree with Balzac and 19th-century writers, black and white, who say, 'I write for money'. \" Younge, speaking after the publication of Angelou's third book of essays, Letter to My Daughter (2008), has said, \"For the last couple of decades she has merged her various talents into a kind of performance art\u2014issuing a message of personal and social uplift by blending poetry, song and conversation. \"Angelou's books, especially I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, have been criticized by many parents, causing their removal from school curricula and library shelves. According to the National Coalition Against Censorship, parents and schools have objected to Caged Bird's depictions of lesbianism, premarital cohabitation, pornography, and violence. Some have been critical of the book's sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent depictions of religion. Caged Bird appeared third on the American Library Association (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990\u20132000 and sixth on the ALA's 2000\u20132009 list. Angelou was honored by universities, literary organizations, government agencies, and special interest groups. Her honors included a Pulitzer Prize nomination for her book of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie, a Tony Award nomination for her role in the 1973 play Look Away, and three Grammys for her spoken word albums. She served on two presidential committees, and was awarded the Spingarn Medal in 1994, the National Medal of Arts in 2000, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. Angelou was awarded over fifty honorary degrees. Angelou's autobiographies have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches in teacher education. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at George Washington University, has trained teachers how to \"talk about race\" in their classrooms with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Gather Together in My Name. According to Glazier, Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony have left readers of Angelou's autobiographies unsure of what she left out and how they should respond to the events she described. Angelou's depictions of her experiences of racism have forced white readers to either explore their feelings about race and their own \"privileged status\", or to avoid the discussion as a means of keeping their privilege. Glazier found that critics have focused on the way Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and on her literary techniques, but readers have tended to react to her storytelling with \"surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography\". Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, analyzed the events in Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. He argued that Angelou's book has provided a \"useful framework\" for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya have faced and how their communities have helped them succeed. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has reported using Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He found Caged Bird a \"highly effective\" tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts. Angelou is best known for her seven autobiographies, but she was also a prolific and successful poet. She was called \"the black woman's poet laureate\", and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans. Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age, and used poetry and other great literature to cope with her rape as a young girl, as described in Caged Bird. According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout, literature also affected Angelou's sensibilities as the poet and writer she became, especially the \"liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon\". Many critics consider Angelou's autobiographies more important than her poetry. Although all her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has not been perceived to be as serious as her prose and has been understudied. Her poems were more interesting when she recited and performed them, and many critics emphasized the public aspect of her poetry. Angelou's lack of critical acclaim has been attributed to both the public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Zofia Burr has countered Angelou's critics by condemning them for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: \"to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional\". Angelou's use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and development of theme, setting, plot, and language has often resulted in the placement of her books into the genre of autobiographical fiction. Angelou made a deliberate attempt in her books to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Scholar Mary Jane Lupton argues that all of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books; Lupton agrees, stating that Angelou tended to \"diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth\", which parallels the conventions of much of African-American autobiography written during the abolitionist period of U. S. history, when as both Lupton and African-American scholar Crispin Sartwell put it, the truth was censored out of the need for self-protection. Scholar Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but claims that Angelou created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form. According to African-American literature scholar Pierre A. Walker, the challenge for much of the history of African-American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able to dare her into writing Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered \"high art\". Angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of \"speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'\". Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou's books \"tracts\" that defend African-American culture and fight negative stereotypes. According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of black culture. McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies \"as a kind of stand-in figure for the black American in Troubled Times\". McWhorter views Angelou's works as dated, but recognizes that \"she has helped to pave the way for contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves\". Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou's works to the writings of Frederick Douglass, stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences. According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can be placed within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose \"follows classic technique in nonpoetic Western forms\". O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a \"monolithic black language\", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a \"more expected ghetto expressiveness\". McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation between her and her audience. As McWhorter states, \"I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is\". McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is \"cleaned up\" for her readers. Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently. McWhorter recognizes that much of the reason for Angelou's style was the \"apologetic\" nature of her writing. When Angelou wrote Caged Bird at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature at the time was \"organic unity\", and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criterion. The events in her books were episodic and crafted like a series of short stories, but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology. Instead, they were placed to emphasize the themes of her books, which include racism, identity, family, and travel. English literature scholar Valerie Sayers has asserted that \"Angelou's poetry and prose are similar\". They both rely on her \"direct voice\", which alternates steady rhythms with syncopated patterns and uses similes and metaphors (e. g. , the caged bird). According to Hagen, Angelou's works were influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the African-American community. For example, she referenced over 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry. In addition, she used the elements of blues music, including the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Angelou, instead of depending upon plot, used personal and historical events to shape her books.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 323. The US Department of Defense reports he was born on 5 August 1973, in Roskilde, Denmark. His mother is Danish and his father is Algerian. Abderrahmane is reported to have been inspired to travel to Afghanistan in the late 1990s in a mosque in Grimh\u00f8jvej, founded by an Algerian refugee named Athme Meheri. Danish journalist Morten Skjoldager described Meheri's mosque as a \"radical mosque\" in his book \"Truslen indefra\" (\"the threat from within\"). Abderrahmane was captured, in December 2001, in Afghanistan, near the Pakistan border. He was transferred to Guantanamo on 10 February 2002. He was repatriated to Denmark on 24 February 2004. Abderrahmane's explanation for how he came to be captured was that he had traveled there to enroll in an Afghan military training camp to undergoing training so he could go fight with Muslim rebels in Chechnya. Abderrahmane was held in Guantanamo Bay for over two years. According to an article in U. S. News & World Report he was released in spite of reservations from US security officials because the Danes had threatened to withdraw their troops if he was not released. Abderrahmane was the subject of a 2004 book entitled \"Den naive terrorist\". After his release, Abderrahmane announced plans to travel to fight in Chechnya. He said he regarded the document he signed promising not to take part in terrorist activity as \"toilet paper\". Danish security officials talked him out of his trip. He has said that Denmark's role in the Occupation of Iraq meant that he thought Danish leaders were legitimate military targets. On 10 October 2007, in the Copenhagen suburb of Greve, Abderrahmane was sentenced to 10 months in jail for the theft of two passports and three credit cards which he used to withdraw more than 110,000 Danish kroner (approximately US$20,000). The items were stolen from the mail sorting office where Abderrahmane was working under a new Danish name. Police only recovered a small proportion of the stolen money and it is unknown where or how the remainder of the money was spent. During the trial, Abderrahmane refused to testify. He also refused to speak to or co-operate with his assigned lawyer. In 2013, it was reported that he had been killed after joining the Syrian Civil War against Bashar al Assad. According to the Copenhagen Post Slimane was believed to be one of a number of Danish Muslims who had traveled to Syria to volunteer to help overthrow Assad. Reason and Long War Journal wrote that Slimane's death underscored the International contribution to the Syrian opposition. On 25 August 2014, the High Court of Eastern Denmark refused to issue a legal finding of death regarding Slimane Hahj Abderrahmane.

In 1943, Abdul Razak, along with two other Malaysian students were chosen to study in Japan for a degree in education. Abdul Razak spent one year at the International Student Institute in Tokyo beginning in 1943. He then transferred to Hiroshima, where he planned to study for four years. In 1945, Abdul Razak was a 19-year-old student attending Hiroshima Bunn University, which is now part of the present-day Hiroshima University, as part of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity programme. \" He had been in Hiroshima for just seven months at the time of the atomic bombing. Abdul Razak was at a university lecture in a classroom on 6 August 1945, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima just 1. 5 km from his location. Abdul Razak lost consciousness as the building collapsed on top of him and awoke to massive destruction. He and another classmate, Yura Halim of Brunei, managed to survive the aftermath of the bombing. A third Southeast Asian student, Hasan Rahaya, who became an Indonesian politician, also survived.

Abdul Razak was forced to abandon the city and suspend his studies in the aftermath. They and other survivors waited in the open for ten days before they were found and brought to Tokyo for medical treatment. Abdul Razak became a professor of Japanese studies and strong proponent of the Japanese language and culture. In 1982, Abdul Razak was appointed the head of Malaysia's Look East Policy by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He also created the Japanese language program for the Centre of Preparatory Education at Institut Teknologi Mara, now known as the present-day Universiti Teknologi MARA in Shah Alam. Abdul Razak taught intensive courses on the Japanese language and culture to thousands of Malaysian students, including many who studied abroad in Japan. In 1995, Abdul Razak was awarded the Japan Foundation Special Prize in a ceremony attended by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. The attendance of the Emperor and Empress at the ceremony was regarded as a rare honour. In February 2013, Abdul Razak received an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Hiroshima University, for his efforts to promote positive Japan\u2013Malaysia relations and dedication to the Japanese language and culture. Two other foreign Hiroshima survivors also received honorary doctorates at the ceremony with Abdul Razak: the former Chief Minister of Brunei Pengiran Yusuf Abdul Rahim who was 91 years old at the time, and Hasan Rahaya, a former member of the People's Consultative Assembly of Indonesia, who was also 91 years old at the time of the ceremony.

Mahmoud Abdulaziz was born in Khartoum in 1967, and died in Amman in January 2013. His music was a blend of traditional music from Sudan and western popmusic with occasional other African influences. At the time of his death he had become a symbol for those wanting a more secular or less strictly religious Sudan. Abdulaziz produced more than 30 records and several of the many YouTube videos with his music have more than one million views. A token of his popularity is that in January 2017 several tens of thousands attended a commemoration gathering. During a concert, a disabled fan, who could not get as close to the stage as he would have wanted, sought to catch the attention of his idol, and started waving his hands. This worked and Abdulaziz mimicked his movements, and also at an occasion came to greet the fan. It became habitual for the artist to greet the devoted fan in this way, at every concert. Subsequently, arms in cross with index finger pointing outwards in front of him, became his symbol, and was in turn taken up by other fans. Even on his deathbed, Mahmoud was photographed in this poise.

He competed as the chief rival of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an Algerian national who had become the major commander in AQIM and later head of his own group. Both gained wealth and power by kidnapping and ransoming European nationals. After taking control of Timbuktu in 2012, Abou Zeid established sharia law and destroyed Sufi shrines. Abou Zeid was killed by French and Chadian troops on 25 February 2013 in fighting in Northern Mali. On 23 March, Zeid's death was \"definitively confirmed\" by the French president's office. Abou Zeid was born in Algeria in 1965. Abou Zeid was one of the senior members of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, (AQIM), an Islamist militant organization. He had been promoted by the emir of AQIM, Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud (a. k. a. Abdelmalek Droukdel); some commentators speculated that Wadoud wanted to have an alternative to Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an increasingly powerful commander in AQIM also operating in Mali. Abou Zeid is believed to have ordered the executions of hostages, including Edwin Dyer in 2009 and Michel Germaneau in 2010. He is believed to have been behind the kidnapping of more than 20 Westerners between 2008 and 2013. The victims were held to gain ransoms to fund the activities of AQIM. When Abou Zeid controlled Timbuktu, he ordered amputations as punishment, and his forces destroyed historic Sufi shrines. With both Abou Zeid and Belmokhtar exerting power in the Sahel region, in the fall of 2012, Wadoud appointed Djamel Okacha (also known as Yahya Abou el-Hammam) as the overall commander of AQIM in the Sahara, in an effort to keep control. According to a memo from him to Abou Zeid found in Timbuktu, Wadoud was concerned that the rapid push to establish Sharia law would provoke armed intervention. In January 2013, France and West African nations responded to the Malian government's request for help and entered with troops in northern Mali to dislodge AQIM. Leading a contingent of Islamists in central Mali, Abou Zeid attacked the small town of Diabaly in January 2013. At the request of the Malian government, the French launched a quick intervention in January to drive the radical Islamists from northern Mali. They entered the area with 1,200 French troops, 800 Chadian soldiers and some elements of the Malian army, fighting in the Adrar mountain range. Abou Zeid was reported killed along with 40 militants on 25 February 2013, by French and Chadian troops near the mountainous region of Tigargara, Northern Mali. At the time, he and his men were believed to be holding at least four French citizens who had been kidnapped in 2010 in Niger. His death was first reported by Algeria's independent Ennahar TV on 28 February 2013. On 1 March 2013, Idriss Deby, President of Chad, said his forces had killed Abou Zeid during fighting in northern Mali. His death was confirmed by an Al Qaeda member on 5 March. According to a Reuters security source, he was replaced as AQIM's leader by Algerian Djamel Okacha (a. k. a. Yahya Abu al-Humam). On 16 June 2013, AQIM officially confirmed the death of Abou Zeid in a martyrdom statement.

He joined the Palestinian Student Union (PSU). He was sentenced to 10 months in jail in 1969 for affiliation with the PSU since all Palestinian unions were banned under Israeli Law. In 1970, he became a fighter for the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah). He was with Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in South Lebanon forces fighting against Israeli forces that invaded Lebanon. He mobilized the resistance against the Israeli invasion and occupation of the West Bank. He was arrested at the end of 1975 and deported to Jordan in 1978. In Jordan, he was the assistant for Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad) and was responsible for Intifada Logistics. He returned to the West Bank at the end of 1998 and joined the Preventive Security Apparatus of the Palestinian Authority as a Colonel. After the beginning of the Second Intifada in September 2000, he was arrested and accused of responsibility for the Hamas cell in the West Bank. He was given a life sentence (99 years according to Israeli Military Law). He died, allegedly of throat cancer, while in an Israeli jail. Eight months prior to his death, Abuhamdia complained of general weakness, sore throat and pain in his joints. After examination by a doctor, according to his family, he received some shots. Abuhamdia asked again for proper examination to diagnose his illness. After four additional months, prison staff transported Abuhamdia to the hospital in Tel-Aviv. According to Abuhamdia's wife, he said, \"They transferred me to the hospital in the prisoners bus. The steel bus seats were uncomfortable. I fell many times during the 6 hour trip. I will not go again unless they bring an ambulance. \" When he went to the hospital, the doctors took samples from his throat for tissue diagnosis, but test results were never shared with him. He remained in jail with other Palestinian prisoners, after a while, his health deteriorated without any medication such as painkillers. His voice disappeared, and his neck swelled with nodes and he became very weak. He could not change his clothes nor could he go to the toilet. Despite this, the Israeli Prison Authority left him in the cell. The prisoners demanded officially from the Prison Authorities to transfer Abuhamdia to hospital, but the Prison Authority said it was too late, and Abuhamdia had only days to live. A week before his death, the Israeli Authorities transferred him to Beir-Shiva Hospital. They did another Biopsy test and declared for the first time that he had Throat Cancer. He received only two Chemotherapy sessions and died on Tuesday, April 2 at 6 am. An Autopsy was performed on his body, and Israel declared that cancer was spread throughout his body. Israel refused to release his medical records and the results of the medical tests. Most Palestinians saw Abuhamdia as a national hero who fought Israel. Abuhamdia's heroism was reflected in the clashes that spread inside the prisons and the Israeli use of force to subdue Palestinian prisoners after his death. He was promoted to General and soon after to Major General by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007. A formal military funeral was held after his death. After his death, the Palestinians became aggravated as they were following his case through the Palestinian Prisoners Club and the Palestinian Ministry of Prisoners. They were expecting him to be released or receive appropriate medical treatment.

"}, {"text": "Janet Lippman Abu-Lughod (August 3, 1928 \u2013 December 14, 2013) was an American sociologist with major contributions to World-systems theory and Urban sociology. She was married in 1951\u20131991 to Ibrahim Abu-Lughod. They had four children; Lila, Mariam, Deena, and Jawad. Raised in Newark, New Jersey, she attended Weequahic High School, where she was influenced by the works of Lewis Mumford about urbanization. Janet Abu-Lughod held graduate degrees from the University of Chicago and University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her teaching career began at the University of Illinois, took her to the American University in Cairo, Smith College, and Northwestern University, where she taught for twenty years and directed several urban studies programmes. In 1950-1952 Abu-Lughod was a director of research for the American Society of Planning Officials, in 1954-1957 \u2013 research associate at the University of Pennsylvania, consultant and author for the American Council to Improve Our Neighborhoods. In 1987 she accepted a professorship in sociology and historical studies at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, from which she retired as professor emerita in 1998. Upon retirement she has held visiting short-term teaching appointments at Bosphorous University in Istanbul and on the International Honors Program at the University of Cairo. She published over a hundred articles and thirteen books dealing with urban sociology, the history and dynamics of the World System, and Middle Eastern cities, including an urban history of Cairo that is still considered one of the classic works on that city: Cairo: 1001 Years of the City Victorious. In 1976 she was awarded a John Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for Sociology. Abu-Lughod has received over a dozen prestigious national government fellowships and grants to research in the areas of demography, urban sociology, urban planning, economic and social development, world systems, and urbanization in the United States, the Middle East and the Third World. She was especially famous for her monograph Before European Hegemony: The World System A. D. 1250-1350 where she argued that a pre-modern world system extending across Eurasia existed in the 13th Century, prior to the formation of the modern world-system identified by Immanuel Wallerstein. In addition, she argued that the \"rise of the West,\" beginning with the intrusion of armed Portuguese ships into the relatively peaceful trade networks of the Indian Ocean in the 16th century, was not a result of features internal to Europe, but was made possible by a collapse in the previous world system. Abu-Lughod in her works approaches the social and economic development of global cities with the commitment to seeing and acting on possibilities for constructive social change. The span of her works goes from micro-level studies of territoriality and social change, to the analysis of the diffusion of global cities in the Western and Arab world, to historical studies of medieval cities. She published several well-received works on American cities including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles: America's Global Cities and Race, Space, and Riots in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles.

His first novel Things Fall Apart (1958), often considered his masterpiece, is the most widely read book in modern African literature. Raised by his parents in the Igbo town of Ogidi in southeastern Nigeria, Achebe excelled at school and won a scholarship to study medicine, but changed his studies to English literature at University College (now the University of Ibadan). He became fascinated with world religions and traditional African cultures, and began writing stories as a university student. After graduation, he worked for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) and soon moved to the metropolis of Lagos. He gained worldwide attention for his novel Things Fall Apart in the late 1950s; his later novels include No Longer at Ease (1960), Arrow of God (1964), A Man of the People (1966), and Anthills of the Savannah (1987). Achebe wrote his novels in English and defended the use of English, a \"language of colonisers\", in African literature. In 1975, his lecture An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" featured a famous criticism of Joseph Conrad as \"a thoroughgoing racist\"; it was later published in The Massachusetts Review amid some controversy. When the region of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a supporter of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador for the people of the new nation. The civil war that took place over the territory, commonly known as the Nigerian Civil War, ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took its toll, he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U. S. in 1990, after a car crash left him partially disabled. A titled Igbo chief himself, Achebe's novels focus on the traditions of Igbo society, the effect of Christian influences, and the clash of Western and traditional African values during and after the colonial era. His style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories, proverbs, and oratory. He also published a large number of short stories, children's books, and essay collections. Upon Achebe's return to the United States in 1990, he began an eighteen-year tenure at Bard College as the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature. From 2009 until his death, he served as David and Marianna Fisher University Professor and Professor of Africana Studies at Brown University. Chinua Achebe was born on 16 November 1930. Achebe's parents, Isaiah Okafo Achebe and Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam, were converts to the Protestant Church Mission Society (CMS) in Nigeria. The elder Achebe stopped practicing the religion of his ancestors, but he respected its traditions. Achebe's unabbreviated name, Chinualumogu (\"May God fight on my behalf\"), was a prayer for divine protection and stability. His writings include his first novel, Things Fall Apart (1958), Anthills of Savannah(1987), and his last There Was a Country originally published in (2012). The Achebe family had five other surviving children, named in a similar fusion of traditional words relating to their new religion: Frank Okwuofu, John Chukwuemeka Ifeanyichukwu, Zinobia Uzoma, Augustine Ndubisi, and Grace Nwanneka. Achebe was born Albert Chinualumogu Achebe in the Igbo village of Ogidi on 16 November 1930. Isaiah Okafo Achebe and Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam Achebe stood at a crossroads of traditional culture and Christian influence; this made a significant impact on the children, especially Chinualumogu. After the youngest daughter was born, the family moved to Isaiah Achebe's ancestral town of Ogidi, in what is now the state of Anambra. Storytelling was a mainstay of the Igbo tradition and an integral part of the community. Achebe's mother and sister Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books \u2013 including a prose adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of The Pilgrim's Progress (1678). Chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the frequent masquerade ceremonies, which he recreated later in his novels and stories. In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, he spent a week in the religious class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills. He also attended Sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart. In 1948, in preparation for independence, Nigeria's first university opened. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine. It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After reading Joyce Cary's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons that he decided to become a writer. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist as a sign of the author's cultural ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is shot. He abandoned the study of medicine and changed to English, history, and theology. Because he switched his field, however, he lost his scholarship and had to pay tuition fees. He received a government bursary, and his family also donated money \u2013 his older brother Augustine gave up money for a trip home from his job as a civil servant so Chinua could continue his studies. From its inception, the university had a strong Arts faculty; it includes many famous writers amongst its alumni. These include Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, poet and playwright John Pepper Clark, and poet Christopher Okigbo. Elechi Amadi is also another famous writer who studied at the university in the 1950s, although he was in the faculty of sciences. In 1950 Achebe wrote a piece for the University Herald entitled \"Polar Undergraduate\", his debut as an author. It used irony and humour to celebrate the intellectual vigour of his classmates. He followed this with other essays and letters about philosophy and freedom in academia, some of which were published in another campus magazine, The Bug. He served as the Herald's editor during the 1951\u201352 school year. While at the university, Achebe wrote his first short story, \"In a Village Church\", which combines details of life in rural Nigeria with Christian institutions and icons, a style which appears in many of his later works. Other short stories he wrote during his time at Ibadan (including \"The Old Order in Conflict with the New\" and \"Dead Men's Path\") examine conflicts between tradition and modernity, with an eye toward dialogue and understanding on both sides. When a professor named Geoffrey Parrinder arrived at the university to teach comparative religion, Achebe began to explore the fields of Christian history and African traditional religions. After the final examinations at Ibadan in 1953, Achebe was awarded a second-class degree. Rattled by not receiving the highest level, he was uncertain how to proceed after graduation. He returned to his hometown of Ogidi to sort through his options. While he meditated on his possible career paths, Achebe was visited by a friend from the university, who convinced him to apply for an English teaching position at the Merchants of Light school at Oba. It was a ramshackle institution with a crumbling infrastructure and a meagre library; the school was built on what the residents called \"bad bush\" \u2013 a section of land thought to be tainted by unfriendly spirits. Later, in Things Fall Apart, Achebe describes a similar area called the \"evil forest\", where the Christian missionaries are given a place to build their church. As a teacher he urged his students to read extensively and be original in their work. The students did not have access to the newspapers he had read as a student, so Achebe made his own available in the classroom. He taught in Oba for four months, but when an opportunity arose in 1954 to work for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS), he left the school and moved to Lagos. The NBS, a radio network started in 1933 by the colonial government, assigned Achebe to the Talks Department, preparing scripts for oral delivery. This helped him master the subtle nuances between written and spoken language, a skill that helped him later to write realistic dialogue. The city of Lagos also made a significant impression on him. A huge conurbation, the city teemed with recent migrants from the rural villages. Achebe revelled in the social and political activity around him and later drew upon his experiences when describing the city in his 1960 novel No Longer at Ease. While in Lagos, Achebe started work on a novel. This was challenging, since very little African fiction had been written in English, although Amos Tutuola's Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) and Cyprian Ekwensi's People of the City (1954) were notable exceptions. While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe worked hard to develop his own style, even as he pioneered the creation of the Nigerian novel itself. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe. Also in 1956 he was selected at the Staff School run by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). His first trip outside Nigeria was an opportunity to advance his technical production skills, and to solicit feedback on his novel (which was later split into two books). In London, he met a novelist named Gilbert Phelps, to whom he offered the manuscript. Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe if he could show it to his editor and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed more work. Back in Nigeria, Achebe set to work revising and editing his novel (now titled Things Fall Apart, after a line in the poem \"The Second Coming\" by W. B. Yeats). He cut away the second and third sections of the book, leaving only the story of a yam farmer named Okonkwo who lives during the colonization of Nigeria. He added sections, improved various chapters, and restructured the prose. By 1957, he had sculpted it to his liking, and took advantage of an advertisement offering a typing service. He sent his only copy of his handwritten manuscript (along with the \u00a322 fee) to the London company. After he waited several months without receiving any communication from the typing service, Achebe began to worry. His boss at the NBS, Angela Beattie, was going to London for her annual leave; he asked her to visit the company. She did, and angrily demanded to know why the manuscript was lying ignored in the corner of the office. The company quickly sent a typed copy to Achebe. Beattie's intervention was crucial for his ability to continue as a writer. Had the novel been lost, he later said, \"I would have been so discouraged that I would probably have given up altogether. \" In 1958, Achebe sent his novel to the agent recommended by Gilbert Phelps in London. It was sent to several publishing houses; some rejected it immediately, claiming that fiction from African writers had no market potential. Finally it reached the office of Heinemann, where executives hesitated until an educational adviser, Donald MacRae, just back in England after a trip through West Africa, read the book and forced the company's hand with his succinct report: \"This is the best novel I have read since the war\". Heinemann published 2,000 hardcover copies of Things Fall Apart on 17 June 1958. According to Alan Hill, employed by the publisher at the time, the company did not \"touch a word of it\" in preparation for release. The book was received well by the British press, and received positive reviews from critic Walter Allen and novelist Angus Wilson. Three days after publication, The Times Literary Supplement wrote that the book \"genuinely succeeds in presenting tribal life from the inside\". The Observer called it \"an excellent novel\", and the literary magazine Time and Tide said that \"Mr. Achebe's style is a model for aspirants\". Initial reception in Nigeria was mixed. When Hill tried to promote the book in West Africa, he was met with scepticism and ridicule. The faculty at the University of Ibadan was amused at the thought of a worthwhile novel being written by an alumnus. Others were more supportive; one review in the magazine Black Orpheus said: \"The book as a whole creates for the reader such a vivid picture of Igbo life that the plot and characters are little more than symbols representing a way of life lost irrevocably within living memory. \"In the book Okonkwo struggles with the legacy of his father \u2013 a shiftless debtor fond of playing the flute \u2013 as well as the complications and contradictions that arise when white missionaries arrive in his village of Umuofia. Exploring the terrain of cultural conflict, particularly the encounter between Igbo tradition and Christian doctrine, Achebe returns to the themes of his earlier stories, which grew from his own background. Things Fall Apart went on to become one of the most important books in African literature. Selling over 20 million copies around the world, it was translated into 57 languages, making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time. The book, in recognition of its universality, appears in the Bokklubben World Library collection \"proposed by one hundred writers from fifty-four different countries, compiled and organized in 2002 by the Norwegian Book Club. This list endeavors to reflect world literature, with books from all countries, cultures, and time periods. \" The book is also included in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's list of \"12 Novels Considered the 'Greatest Book Ever Written'\". Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has described the work as \"the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character, rather than portraying the African as an exotic, as the white man would see him. \" In the same year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was promoted at the NBS and put in charge of the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines. Achebe and Okoli grew closer in the following years, and on 10 September 1961 they were married in the Chapel of Resurrection on the campus of the University of Ibadan. Christie Achebe has described their marriage as one of trust and mutual understanding; some tension arose early in their union, due to conflicts about attention and communication. However, as their relationship matured, husband and wife made efforts to adapt to one another. Their first child, a daughter named Chinelo, was born on 11 July 1962. They had a son, Ikechukwu, on 3 December 1964, and another boy named Chidi, on 24 May 1967. When the children began attending school in Lagos, their parents became worried about the world view \u2013 especially with regard to race \u2013 expressed at the school, especially through the mostly white teachers and books that presented a prejudiced view of African life. In 1966, Achebe published his first children's book, Chike and the River, to address some of these concerns. After the Biafran War, the Achebes had another daughter on 7 March 1970, named Nwando. In 1960, while they were still dating, Achebe dedicated to Christie Okoli his second novel, No Longer at Ease, about a civil servant who is embroiled in the corruption of Lagos. The protagonist is Obi, grandson of Things Fall Apart's main character, Okonkwo. Drawing on his time in the city, Achebe writes about Obi's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation on the threshold of Nigerian independence. Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family, its clan, his home village, and larger society. He is crushed by these forces (like his grandfather before him) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture, Achebe demonstrated in his second novel an ability to depict modern Nigerian life. Later that year, Achebe was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship for six months of travel, which he called \"the first important perk of my writing career\"; Achebe set out for a tour of East Africa. One month after Nigeria achieved its independence, he travelled to Kenya, where he was required to complete an immigration form by checking a box indicating his ethnicity: European, Asiatic, Arab, or Other. Shocked and dismayed at being forced into an \"Other\" identity, he found the situation \"almost funny\" and took an extra form as a souvenir. Continuing to Tanganyika and Zanzibar (now united in Tanzania), he was frustrated by the paternalistic attitude he observed among non-African hotel clerks and social elites. Achebe also found in his travels that Swahili was gaining prominence as a major African language. Radio programs were broadcast in Swahili, and its use was widespread in the countries he visited. Nevertheless, he also found an \"apathy\" among the people toward literature written in Swahili. He met the poet Sheikh Shaaban Robert, who complained of the difficulty he had faced in trying to publish his Swahili-language work. In Northern Rhodesia (now called Zambia), Achebe found himself sitting in a whites-only section of a bus to Victoria Falls. Interrogated by the ticket taker as to why he was sitting in the front, he replied, \"if you must know I come from Nigeria, and there we sit where we like in the bus. \" Upon reaching the waterfall, he was cheered by the black travellers from the bus, but he was saddened by their being unable to resist the policy of segregation at the time. Two years later, Achebe again left Nigeria, this time as part of a Fellowship for Creative Artists awarded by UNESCO. He travelled to the United States and Brazil. He met with a number of writers from the US, including novelists Ralph Ellison and Arthur Miller. In Brazil, he met with several other authors, with whom he discussed the complications of writing in Portuguese. Achebe worried that the vibrant literature of the nation would be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language. Once he returned to Nigeria, Achebe was promoted at the NBS to the position of Director of External Broadcasting. One of his first duties was to help create the Voice of Nigeria network. The station broadcast its first transmission on New Year's Day 1962, and worked to maintain an objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence. This objectivity was put to the test when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa declared a state of emergency in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties. Achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition. In 1962 he attended an executive conference of African writers in English at the Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda. He met with important literary figures from around the continent and the world, including Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor, Nigerian playwright and poet Wole Soyinka, and US poet-author Langston Hughes. Among the topics of discussion was an attempt to determine whether the term African literature ought to include work from the diaspora, or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself. Achebe indicated that it was not \"a very significant question\", and that scholars would do well to wait until a body of work were large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond. While at Makerere, Achebe was asked to read a novel written by a student (James Ngugi, later known as Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o) called Weep Not, Child. Impressed, he sent it to Alan Hill at Heinemann, which published it two years later to coincide with its paperback line of books from African writers. Hill indicated this was to remedy a situation where British publishers \"regarded West Africa only as a place where you sold books. \" Achebe was chosen to be General Editor of the African Writers Series, which became a significant force in bringing postcolonial literature from Africa to the rest of the world, and he continued in that role until 1972. As these works became more widely available, reviews and essays about African literature \u2013 especially from Europe \u2013 began to flourish. Bristling against the commentary flooding his home country, Achebe published an essay entitled \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\" in the December 1962 issue of Nigeria Magazine. In it, he distinguished between the hostile critic (entirely negative), the amazed critic (entirely positive), and the conscious critic (who seeks a balance). He lashed out at those who critiqued African writers from the outside, saying: \"no man can understand another whose language he does not speak (and 'language' here does not mean simply words, but a man's entire world view). \" In September 1964 he attended the Commonwealth Literature conference at the University of Leeds, presenting his essay \"The Novelist as Teacher\". Achebe's third book, Arrow of God, was published in 1964. Like its predecessors, it explores the intersections of Igbo tradition and European Christianity. Set in the village of Umuaro at the start of the twentieth century, the novel tells the story of Ezeulu, a Chief Priest of Ulu. Shocked by the power of British intervention in the area, he orders his son to learn the foreigners' secret. Ezeulu is consumed by the resulting tragedy. The idea for the novel came in 1959, when Achebe heard the story of a Chief Priest being imprisoned by a District Officer. He drew further inspiration a year later when he viewed a collection of Igbo objects excavated from the area by archaeologist Thurstan Shaw; Achebe was startled by the cultural sophistication of the artifacts. When an acquaintance showed him a series of papers from colonial officers (not unlike the fictional Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger referenced at the end of Things Fall Apart), Achebe combined these strands of history and began work on Arrow of God in earnest. Like Achebe's previous works, Arrow was roundly praised by critics. A revised edition was published in 1974 to correct what Achebe called \"certain structural weaknesses\". In a letter written to Achebe, the US writer John Updike expressed his surprised admiration for the sudden downfall of Arrow of God's protagonist. He praised the author's courage to write \"an ending few Western novelists would have contrived\". Achebe responded by suggesting that the individualistic hero was rare in African literature, given its roots in communal living and the degree to which characters are \"subject to non-human forces in the universe\". A Man of the People was published in 1966. A bleak satire set in an unnamed African state which has just attained independence, the novel follows a teacher named Odili Samalu from the village of Anata who opposes a corrupt Minister of Culture named Nanga for his Parliament seat. Upon reading an advance copy of the novel, Achebe's friend John Pepper Clark declared: \"Chinua, I know you are a prophet. Everything in this book has happened except a military coup!\"Soon afterward, Nigerian Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu seized control of the northern region of the country as part of a larger coup attempt. Commanders in other areas failed, and the plot was answered by a military crackdown. A massacre of three thousand people from the eastern region living in the north occurred soon afterwards, and stories of other attacks on Igbo Nigerians began to filter into Lagos. The ending of his novel had brought Achebe to the attention of military personnel, who suspected him of having foreknowledge of the coup. When he received word of the pursuit, he sent his wife (who was pregnant) and children on a squalid boat through a series of unseen creeks to the Igbo stronghold of Port Harcourt. They arrived safely, but Christie suffered a miscarriage at the journey's end. Chinua rejoined them soon afterwards in Ogidi. These cities were safe from military incursion because they were in the southeast, part of the region which would later secede. Once the family had resettled in Enugu, Achebe and his friend Christopher Okigbo started a publishing house called Citadel Press, to improve the quality and increase the quantity of literature available to younger readers. One of its first submissions was a story called How the Dog was Domesticated, which Achebe revised and rewrote, turning it into a complex allegory for the country's political tumult. Its final title was How the Leopard Got His Claws. Years later a Nigerian intelligence officer told Achebe, \"of all the things that came out of Biafra, that book was most important. \" In May 1967, the southeastern region of Nigeria broke away to form the Republic of Biafra; in July the Nigerian military attacked to suppress what it considered an unlawful rebellion. Achebe's colleague, Christopher Okigbo, who had become a close friend of the family (especially of Achebe's son, young Ikechukwu), volunteered to join the secessionist army while simultaneously working at the press. Achebe's house was bombed one afternoon; Christie had taken the children to visit her sick mother, so the only victims were his books and papers. The Achebe family narrowly escaped disaster several times during the war. Five days later, Christopher Okigbo was killed on the war's front line. Achebe was shaken considerably by the loss; in 1971 he wrote \"Dirge for Okigbo\", originally in the Igbo language but later translated to English. As the war intensified, the Achebe family was forced to leave Enugu for the Biafran capital of Aba. As the turmoil closed in, he continued to write, but most of his creative work during the war took the form of poetry. The shorter format was a consequence of living in a war zone. \"I can write poetry,\" he said, \"something short, intense more in keeping with my mood . . . All this is creating in the context of our struggle. \" Many of these poems were collected in his 1971 book Beware, Soul Brother. One of his most famous, \"Refugee Mother and Child\", spoke to the suffering and loss that surrounded him. Dedicated to the promise of Biafra, he accepted a request to serve as foreign ambassador, refusing an invitation from the Program of African Studies at Northwestern University in the US. Achebe traveled to many cities in Europe, including London, where he continued his work with the African Writers Series project at Heinemann. During the war, relations between writers in Nigeria and Biafra were strained. Achebe and John Pepper Clark had a tense confrontation in London over their respective support for opposing sides of the conflict. Achebe demanded that the publisher withdraw the dedication of A Man of the People he had given to Clark. Years later, their friendship healed and the dedication was restored. Meanwhile, their contemporary Wole Soyinka was imprisoned for meeting with Biafran officials, and spent two years in jail. Speaking in 1968, Achebe said: \"I find the Nigerian situation untenable. If I had been a Nigerian, I think I would have been in the same situation as Wole Soyinka is \u2013 in prison. \"The Nigerian government, under the leadership of General Yakubu Gowon, was backed by the British government; the two nations enjoyed a vigorous trade partnership. Addressing the causes of the war in 1968, Achebe lashed out at the Nigerian political and military forces that had forced Biafra to secede. He framed the conflict in terms of the country's colonial past. The writer in Nigeria, he said, \"found that the independence his country was supposed to have won was totally without content . . . The old white master was still in power. He had got himself a bunch of black stooges to do his dirty work for a commission. \" Conditions in Biafra worsened as the war continued. In September 1968, the city of Aba fell to the Nigerian military and Achebe once again moved his family, this time to Umuahia, where the Biafran government had also relocated. He was chosen to chair the newly formed National Guidance Committee, charged with the task of drafting principles and ideas for the post-war era. In 1969, the group completed a document entitled The Principles of the Biafran Revolution, later released as The Ahiara Declaration. In October of the same year, Achebe joined writers Cyprian Ekwensi and Gabriel Okara for a tour of the United States to raise awareness about the dire situation in Biafra. They visited thirty college campuses and conducted countless interviews. While in the southern US, Achebe learned for the first time of the Igbo Landing, a true story of a group of Igbo captives who drowned themselves in 1803 \u2013 rather than endure the brutality of slavery \u2013 after surviving through the Middle Passage. Although the group was well received by students and faculty, Achebe was \"shocked\" by the harsh racist attitude toward Africa he saw in the US. At the end of the tour, he said that \"world policy is absolutely ruthless and unfeeling\". The beginning of 1970 saw the end of the state of Biafra. On 12 January, the military surrendered to Nigeria, and Achebe returned with his family to Ogidi, where their home had been destroyed. He took a job at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka and immersed himself once again in academia. He was unable to accept invitations to other countries, however, because the Nigerian government revoked his passport due to his support for Biafra. After the war, Achebe helped start two magazines: the literary journal Okike, a forum for African art, fiction, and poetry; and Nsukkascope, an internal publication of the University (motto: \"Devastating, Fearless, Brutal and True\"). Achebe and the Okike committee later established another cultural magazine, Uwa Ndi Igbo, to showcase the indigenous stories and oral traditions of the Igbo community. In February 1972 he released Girls at War, a collection of short stories ranging in time from his undergraduate days to the recent bloodshed. It was the 100th book in Heinemann's African Writers Series. The University of Massachusetts Amherst offered Achebe a professorship later that year, and the family moved to the United States. Their youngest daughter was displeased with her nursery school, and the family soon learned that her frustration involved language. Achebe helped her face the \"alien experience\" (as he called it) by telling her stories during the car trips to and from school. As he presented his lessons to a wide variety of students (he taught only one class, to a large audience), he began to study the perceptions of Africa in Western scholarship: \"Africa is not like anywhere else they know . . . there are no real people in the Dark Continent, only forces operating; and people don't speak any language you can understand, they just grunt, too busy jumping up and down in a frenzy\". Achebe expanded this criticism when he presented a Chancellor's Lecture at Amherst on 18 February 1975, 'An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\"'. Decrying Joseph Conrad as \"a bloody racist\", Achebe asserted that Conrad's famous novel dehumanises Africans, rendering Africa as \"a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril. \"Achebe also discussed a quotation from Albert Schweitzer, a 1952 Nobel Peace Prize laureate: \"That extraordinary missionary, Albert Schweitzer, who sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in Europe for a life of service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about, epitomizes the ambivalence. In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother. ' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being. \" Some were surprised that Achebe would challenge a man honoured in the West for his \"reverence for life\". The lecture caused a storm of controversy, even at the reception immediately following his talk. Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: \"How dare you!\", and stormed away. Another suggested that Achebe had \"no sense of humour\", but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: \"I now realize that I had never really read Heart of Darkness although I have taught it for years. \" Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers. The first comprehensive rebuttal of Achebe's critique was published in 1983 by British critic Cedric Watts. His essay \"A Bloody Racist: About Achebe's View of Conrad\" defends Heart of Darkness as an anti-imperialist novel, suggesting that \"part of its greatness lies in the power of its criticisms of racial prejudice. \" Palestinian\u2013American theorist Edward Said agreed in his book Culture and Imperialism that Conrad criticised imperialism, but added: \"As a creature of his time, Conrad could not grant the natives their freedom, despite his severe critique of the imperialism that enslaved them\". Building on Watts and Said, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that \"underneath the first layer of straightforward opposition . . . we find an underlying mimetic continuity between Conrad's colonial image of Africa [in Heart of Darkness] and Achebe's postcolonial representation\" in Things Fall Apart. Achebe's criticism has become a mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay was included in the 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of \"the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book . . . \" Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism \"into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe. \" Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: \"It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it \u2013 with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works. \" Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled \"'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate\": \"Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And if it were not for what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction. \" When he returned to the University of Nigeria in 1976, he hoped to accomplish three goals: finish the novel he had been writing, renew the native publication of Okike, and further his study of Igbo culture. He also showed that he would not restrict his criticism to European targets. In an August 1976 interview, he lashed out at the archetypal Nigerian intellectual, who is divorced from the intellect \"but for two things: status and stomach. And if there's any danger that he might suffer official displeasure or lose his job, he would prefer to turn a blind eye to what is happening around him. \" In October 1979, Achebe was awarded the first-ever Nigerian National Merit Award. In 1980 he met James Baldwin at a conference held by the African Literature Association in Gainesville, Florida, USA. The writers \u2013 with similar political perspectives, beliefs about language, and faith in the liberating potential of literature \u2013 were eager to meet one another. Baldwin said: \"It's very important that we should meet each other, finally, if I must say so, after something like 400 years. \"In 1982, Achebe retired from the University of Nigeria. He devoted more time to editing Okike and became active with the left-leaning People's Redemption Party (PRP). In 1983, he became the party's deputy national vice-president. He published a book called The Trouble with Nigeria to coincide with the upcoming elections. On the first page, Achebe says bluntly: \"the Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility and to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership. \"The elections that followed were marked by violence and charges of fraud. Asked whether he thought Nigerian politics had changed since A Man of the People, Achebe replied: \"I think, if anything, the Nigerian politician has deteriorated. \" After the elections, he engaged in a heated argument \u2013 which almost became a fistfight \u2013 with Bakin Zuwo, the newly elected governor of Kano State. He left the PRP and afterwards kept his distance from political parties, expressing his sadness at the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved. He spent most of the 1980s delivering speeches, attending conferences, and working on his sixth novel. He also continued winning awards and collecting honorary degrees. In 1986 he was elected president-general of the Ogidi Town Union; he reluctantly accepted and began a three-year term. In the same year, he stepped down as editor of Okike. In 1987 Achebe released his fifth novel, Anthills of the Savannah, about a military coup in the fictional West African nation of Kangan. A finalist for the Booker Prize, the novel was hailed in the Financial Times: \"in a powerful fusion of myth, legend and modern styles, Achebe has written a book which is wise, exciting and essential, a powerful antidote to the cynical commentators from 'overseas' who see nothing ever new out of Africa. \" An opinion piece in the magazine West Africa said the book deserved to win the Booker Prize, and that Achebe was \"a writer who has long deserved the recognition that has already been accorded him by his sales figures. \" The prize went instead to Penelope Lively's novel Moon Tiger. On 22 March 1990, Achebe was riding in a car to Lagos when an axle collapsed and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but the weight of the vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Soon afterwards, Achebe became the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York; he held the position for more than fifteen years. In 1999, Achebe was awarded the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. In the autumn of 2009 he joined the Brown University faculty as the David and Marianna Fisher University Professor of Africana Studies. In October 2005, the London Financial Times reported that Achebe was planning to write a novella for the Canongate Myth Series, a series of short novels in which ancient myths from myriad cultures are reimagined and rewritten by contemporary authors. In June 2007, Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize. The judging panel included US critic Elaine Showalter, who said he \"illuminated the path for writers around the world seeking new words and forms for new realities and societies\"; and South African writer Nadine Gordimer, who said Achebe has achieved \"what one of his characters brilliantly defines as the writer's purpose: 'a new-found utterance' for the capture of life's complexity\". In 2010, Achebe was awarded The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize for $300,000, one of the richest prizes for the arts. In October 2012, Achebe's publishers, Penguin Books, released There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra. Publication immediately caused a stir and re-opened the discussion about the Nigerian Civil War. It would prove to be the last publication during his lifetime. Fondly called the \"father of African literature\", Achebe died after a short illness on 21 March 2013 in Boston, United States. An unidentified source close to the family said that he was ill for a while and had been hospitalised in the city. Penguin publishing director Simon Winder said: \". . . we are all desolate to hear of his death. \" The New York Times described him in his obituary as \"one of Africa's most widely read novelists and one of the continent's towering men of letters\". The BBC wrote that he was \"revered throughout the world for his depiction of life in Africa\". He was laid to rest in his hometown in Ogidi, Anambra State. The style of Achebe's fiction draws heavily on the oral tradition of the Igbo people. He weaves folk tales into the fabric of his stories, illuminating community values in both the content and the form of the storytelling. The tale about the Earth and Sky in Things Fall Apart, for example, emphasises the interdependency of the masculine and the feminine. Although Nwoye enjoys hearing his mother tell the tale, Okonkwo's dislike for it is evidence of his imbalance. Later, Nwoye avoids beatings from his father by pretending to dislike such \"women's stories\". Another hallmark of Achebe's style is the use of proverbs, which often illustrate the values of the rural Igbo tradition. He sprinkles them throughout the narratives, repeating points made in conversation. Critic Anjali Gera notes that the use of proverbs in Arrow of God \"serves to create through an echo effect the judgement of a community upon an individual violation. \" The use of such repetition in Achebe's urban novels, No Longer at Ease and A Man of the People, is less pronounced. For Achebe, however, proverbs and folk stories are not the sum total of the oral Igbo tradition. In combining philosophical thought and public performance into the use of oratory (\"Okwu Oka\" \u2013 \"speech artistry\" \u2013 in the Igbo phrase), his characters exhibit what he called \"a matter of individual excellence . . . part of Igbo culture. \" In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo's friend Obierika voices the most impassioned oratory, crystallising the events and their significance for the village. Nwaka in Arrow of God also exhibits a mastery of oratory, albeit for malicious ends. Achebe frequently includes folk songs and descriptions of dancing in his work. Obi, the protagonist of No Longer at Ease, is at one point met by women singing a \"Song of the Heart\", which Achebe gives in both Igbo and English: \"Is everyone here? / (Hele ee he ee he)\" In Things Fall Apart, ceremonial dancing and the singing of folk songs reflect the realities of Igbo tradition. The elderly Uchendu, attempting to shake Okonkwo out of his self-pity, refers to a song sung after the death of a woman: \"For whom is it well, for whom is it well? There is no one for whom it is well. \" This song contrasts with the \"gay and rollicking tunes of evangelism\" sung later by the white missionaries. Achebe's short stories are not as widely studied as his novels, and Achebe himself did not consider them a major part of his work. In the preface for Girls at War and Other Stories, he writes: \"A dozen pieces in twenty years must be accounted a pretty lean harvest by any reckoning. \" Like his novels, the short stories are heavily influenced by the oral tradition. And like the folktales they follow, the stories often have morals emphasising the importance of cultural traditions. As the decolonisation process unfolded in the 1950s, a debate about choice of language erupted and pursued authors around the world; Achebe was no exception. Indeed, because of his subject matter and insistence on a non-colonial narrative, he found his novels and decisions interrogated with extreme scrutiny \u2013 particularly with regard to his use of English. One school of thought, championed by Kenyan writer Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o, urged the use of indigenous African languages. English and other European languages, he said in 1986, were \"part of the neo-colonial structures that repress progressive ideas\". Achebe chose to write in English. In his essay \"The African Writer and the English Language\", he discusses how the process of colonialism \u2013 for all its ills \u2013 provided colonised people from varying linguistic backgrounds \"a language with which to talk to one another\". As his purpose is to communicate with readers across Nigeria, he uses \"the one central language enjoying nationwide currency\". Using English also allowed his books to be read in the colonial ruling nations. Still, Achebe recognises the shortcomings of what Audre Lorde called \"the master's tools\". In another essay he notes: For an African writing in English is not without its serious setbacks. He often finds himself describing situations or modes of thought which have no direct equivalent in the English way of life. Caught in that situation he can do one of two things. He can try and contain what he wants to say within the limits of conventional English or he can try to push back those limits to accommodate his ideas . . . I submit that those who can do the work of extending the frontiers of English so as to accommodate African thought-patterns must do it through their mastery of English and not out of innocence. In another essay, he refers to James Baldwin's struggle to use the English language to accurately represent his experience, and his realisation that he needed to take control of the language and expand it. The Nigerian poet and novelist Gabriel Okara likens the process of language-expansion to the evolution of jazz music in the United States. Achebe's novels laid a formidable groundwork for this process. By altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into a distinctly African style. In some spots this takes the form of repetition of an Igbo idea in standard English parlance; elsewhere it appears as narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences. Achebe's novels approach a variety of themes. In his early writing, a depiction of the Igbo culture itself is paramount. Critic Nahem Yousaf highlights the importance of these depictions: \"Around the tragic stories of Okonkwo and Ezeulu, Achebe sets about textualising Igbo cultural identity\". The portrayal of indigenous life is not simply a matter of literary background, he adds: \"Achebe seeks to produce the effect of a precolonial reality as an Igbo-centric response to a Eurocentrically constructed imperial 'reality' \". Certain elements of Achebe's depiction of Igbo life in Things Fall Apart match those in Olaudah Equiano's autobiographical Narrative. Responding to charges that Equiano was not actually born in Africa, Achebe wrote in 1975: \"Equiano was an Igbo, I believe, from the village of Iseke in the Orlu division of Nigeria\". A prevalent theme in Achebe's novels is the intersection of African tradition (particularly Igbo varieties) and modernity, especially as embodied by European colonialism. The village of Umuofia in Things Fall Apart, for example, is violently shaken with internal divisions when the white Christian missionaries arrive. Nigerian English professor Ernest N. Emenyonu describes the colonial experience in the novel as \"the systematic emasculation of the entire culture\". Achebe later embodied this tension between African tradition and Western influence in the figure of Sam Okoli, the president of Kangan in Anthills of the Savannah. Distanced from the myths and tales of the community by his Westernised education, he does not have the capacity for reconnection shown by the character Beatrice. The colonial impact on the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often effected by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude. The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise clash with the traditions of the Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision-making. The standard Achebean ending results in the destruction of an individual and, by synecdoche, the downfall of the community. Odili's descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in A Man of the People, for example, is symbolic of the post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere. Even with the emphasis on colonialism, however, Achebe's tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, as represented by Sophocles and Shakespeare. Still, Achebe seeks to portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability. In 1972, he said: \"I never will take the stand that the Old must win or that the New must win. The point is that no single truth satisfied me\u2014and this is well founded in the Igbo world view. No single man can be correct all the time, no single idea can be totally correct. \" His perspective is reflected in the words of Ikem, a character in Anthills of the Savannah: \"whatever you are is never enough; you must find a way to accept something, however small, from the other to make you whole and to save you from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism. \" And in a 1996 interview, Achebe said: \"Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things . . . Evil is never all evil; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness. \" The gender roles of men and women, as well as societies' conceptions of the associated concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success. As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control 'his' women is inextricably connected to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranchised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity. Womanism is \"an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women\" that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women. As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably from the work of African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe's women some agency and prominence. In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo's furious manhood overpowers everything \"feminine\" in his life, including his own conscience. For example, when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son, he asks himself: \"When did you become a shivering old woman?\" It is also argued that one's chi, or personal god, is the 'mother within'. This understanding further demonstrates how Okonkwo's hypermasculinity corrupts his conscience, as his contempt for his own mother and other women prevents him from being in harmony with his chi. He views all things feminine as distasteful, in part because they remind him of his father's laziness and cowardice. His father was considered an agbala\u2014a word that refers to a man without title, but is also synonymous with 'woman'. Thus, Okonkwo not only regrets his father's lack of success, but attributes it to a lack of masculinity. Okonkwo's feminization of all things lacking success or power is a common theme throughout the novel. His obsession with maleness is fueled by an intense fear of femaleness, which he expresses through physical and verbal abuse of his wives, his violence towards his community, his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough, and his wish that his daughter Ezinma had been born a boy. The women in the novel, meanwhile, are obedient, quiet, and absent from positions of authority \u2013 despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership. Nevertheless, the need for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani, the earth goddess, and the extended discussion of \"Nneka\" (\"Mother is supreme\") in chapter fourteen. Ekwefi's perseverance and love for Ezinma, despite her many miscarriages, is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood, which is typically defined by motherhood. Okonkwo's defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos. Some have also argued that all of Okonkwo's failures are tied to his contempt and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life\u2014his wives, his children, and his own mother. Achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point, saying that \"I want to sort of scream that Things Fall Apart is on the side of women . . . And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women; that all his problems, all the things he did wrong, can be seen as offenses against the feminine. \" Indeed, it is argued that Okonkwo's violent and vehement anti-women position is the exception, not the norm, within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society. Still, post-colonial African writing is intensely male-centred, a phenomenon that is not alleviated by the frequent trope of the African woman as the \"embodiment of the male writer's vision for the new Africa\". It is argued that even when women and their lives are more centrally depicted in literature, the male writer continues to be the visionary while the woman is the \"sign\" of changes to come. Achebe's first central female character in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although the final stages of the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities. Achebe has been called \"the father of modern African writing\" and Africa's greatest storyteller, and many books and essays have been written about his work over the past fifty years. In 1992 he became the first living writer to be represented in the Everyman's Library collection published by Alfred A. Knopf. His 60th birthday was celebrated at the University of Nigeria by \"an international Who's Who in African Literature\". One observer noted: \"Nothing like it had ever happened before in African literature anywhere on the continent. \"Achebe provided a \"blueprint\" for African writers of succeeding generations. In 1982, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Kent. At the ceremony, professor Robert Gibson said that the Nigerian writer \"is now revered as Master by the younger generation of African writers and it is to him they regularly turn for counsel and inspiration. \" Even outside of Africa, his impact resonates strongly in literary circles. Novelist Margaret Atwood called him \"a magical writer \u2013 one of the greatest of the twentieth century\". Poet Maya Angelou lauded Things Fall Apart as a book wherein \"all readers meet their brothers, sisters, parents and friends and themselves along Nigerian roads\". Nelson Mandela, recalling his time as a political prisoner, once referred to Achebe as a writer \"in whose company the prison walls fell down\", and that his work Things Fall Apart inspired him to continue the struggle to end apartheid. Nobel laureate Toni Morrison has noted that Achebe's work inspired her to become a writer and \"sparked her love affair with African literature\". Achebe was the recipient of over 30 honorary degrees from universities in England, Scotland, Canada, South Africa, Nigeria and the United States, including Dartmouth College, Harvard, and Brown University. He was awarded the Commonwealth Poetry Prize, an Honorary Fellowship of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1982), a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2002), the Nigerian National Order of Merit (Nigeria's highest honour for academic work), the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, the Man Booker International Prize 2007 and the 2010 Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize. He was appointed Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Population Fund in 1999. He twice refused the Nigerian honour Commander of the Federal Republic, in 2004 and 2011, saying: I have watched particularly the chaos in my own state of Anambra where a small clique of renegades, openly boasting its connections in high places, seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom. I am appalled by the brazenness of this clique and the silence, if not connivance, of the Presidency. Despite his scholarly achievements and the global importance of his work, Achebe never received a Nobel Prize, which some observers viewed as unjust. When Wole Soyinka was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, Achebe joined the rest of Nigeria in celebrating the first African ever to win the prize. He lauded Soyinka's \"stupendous display of energy and vitality\", and said he was \"most eminently deserving of any prize\". In 1988 Achebe was asked by a reporter for Quality Weekly how he felt about never winning a Nobel Prize; he replied: \"My position is that the Nobel Prize is important. But it is a European prize. It's not an African prize . . . Literature is not a heavyweight championship. Nigerians may think, you know, this man has been knocked out. It's nothing to do with that. \"On 16 November 2017, Google showed a Doodle in Nigeria and the U. S. for Chinua Achebe's 87th birthday.

(January 10, 1947 \u2013 February 2, 2013) was an American educator whose jobs included superintendent of the District of Columbia Public Schools, San Francisco Unified School District and Philadelphia Public Schools. Dr. Ackerman received her doctorate in Administration, Planning, & Social Policy from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Urban Superintendents Program. She held a Master of Arts in Education from Harvard University, a Master of Arts in Educational Administration and Policy from Washington University in St. Louis, and a Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education from Harris Stowe Teacher's College in St. Louis, Missouri. Dr. Ackerman's had experience as a classroom teacher at both the elementary and middle school levels; principal at the middle school level; Director, Upward Bound Program for first-generation college-bound students; Director, Basic Skills Academy for at-risk high school youth; Assistant Superintendent, Special Services; Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum, Instruction and Academic Achievement; and Deputy Superintendent/Chief Academic Officer. In August 1997, D. C. schools chief executive James W. Becton, Jr. appointed Ackerman as his deputy and chief academic officer. At the time, the federal District of Columbia Financial Control Board oversaw finances and government decisions in the District. She became superintendent of the D. C. public schools from May 1998 until July 17, 2000. In July 2000, Ackerman became the first female superintendent of San Francisco's Unified School District. She held that position until 2007. During her time, Dr. Ackerman positioned San Francisco Public schools as one of the five finalists for the 2005 Broad Prize for Urban Education, given annually to the best urban school district in the country. In spring 2005, California announced that for the second year in a row, San Francisco had the highest student achievement of any urban school system in California. While superintendent, 86% of the district's underperforming schools made continued progress after Dr. Ackerman introduced a program to target additional resources and create a new equitable funding formula for those schools. All ethnicities and all groups of students including special education, gifted and English Language Learners (ELL) demonstrated gains on state mandated exams, and all students consistently scored above the state and national averages in reading and in math. During her tenure in San Francisco, the city's public schools with, 62,000 students and 117 schools, attained five consecutive years of improved achievement for all groups of students while also holding the distinction as the highest performing large urban school district in the state of California during the last two years of her superintendence. Ackerman won national acclaim for initiatives she implemented in San Francisco's schools, including extra support for low-performing schools; the \"weighted student formula,\" in which funding followed each student in different amounts depending on the student's needs; and \"site-based budgeting,\" which gave schools (as opposed to district bureaucrats) far more control over their own budgets. In May 2007, after her departure, she sued the district, asserting that they had not paid $170,000 of her agreed-on severance compensation. She dropped the suit the following month. Dr. Ackerman joined Teachers College, Columbia University, where she served as Director of the Urban Education Leaders Program and Chairperson of the Superintendents and Scholars Symposium. The Urban Leaders Education Program is the College's largest doctoral program for public-school leaders. She joined Teachers College's Education Leadership faculty as the Christian A. Johnson Professor of Outstanding Educational Practice in 2006. Ackerman joined Philadelphia public schools as superintendent in 2008. Ackerman developed Imagine 2014, her five-year plan for school reform and strategy to secure more resources to needy schools. Under her leadership, half of all Philadelphia school children met standards on state exams, a first for the district since federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 had been enacted. Ackerman's claim to have overseen an improvement in Philadelphia students' performance on standardized tests was challenged by the emergence of evidence that students' scores were inflated by widespread teacher-assisted cheating. Arlene Ackerman was forced to resign by Mayor Michael Nutter and the School Reform Commission, after a variety of complaints from state senators, teachers, parents, and students. Rampant school violence, dictatorial policy decisions with no teacher involvement, indifference towards racial intimidation against Asian students at South Philadelphia High School and other Philadelphia schools, unethical bidding for multimillion-dollar contracts, the largest school deficit in district history, and recent allegations of test score manipulation clouded Ackerman's legacy of work for the Philadelphia school district. After three years, she reached an agreement with the Philadelphia School Reform Commission to resign her post in return for $905,000 plus $86,000 in unused vacation pay. In November 2011, she caused surprise by filing for unemployment compensation. Ackerman received numerous honors and awards including Apple for the Teacher Award-Iota Lambda Sorority, Distinguished Alumni Award-Harris Stowe Teachers College, and recognition from Harvard University's Urban Superintendents Program. Ackerman served on The President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities which advises the President and the Secretary of Education on strengthening these institutions. In 2004 she was named 'Superintendent of the Year' by the National Association of Black School Educators. In 2010, she received the Richard R. Green Award for Urban Superintendent of the Year from the Council of Great City Schools in recognition of her contributions to urban schools and students. As the winner of the Richard R. Green Award, Ackerman received a $10,000 college scholarship to give to a student. Dr. Ackerman selected Emilio Garcia, a 2011 graduate of the district, to receive the scholarship. In 2011 she received the Dr. Effie Jones Humanitarian Award which honors leadership in educational equity and excellence. She held the Christian A. Johnson Endowed Chair in Outstanding Educational Practice at Teachers College, Columbia University. Ackerman and her team earned praise from President Barack Obama and United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan for an intervention approach aimed at turning around the District of Columbia's struggling schools under the Empowerment, Renaissance and Promise Academy initiatives. Dr. Ackerman died in Albuquerque, NM on Feb 2, 2013 from pancreatic cancer. "}, {"text": "Blaster Al Ackerman (born William Hogg Greathouse, Jr. ; November 27, 1939 \u2013 March 17, 2013) was an American mail artist and writer. Ackerman had been active in various subcultures since the early 1970s. Heavily influenced by post-war pulp writers like Theodore Sturgeon, Raymond Chandler and Fredric Brown (with whom Ackerman corresponded as a young person) as well as by modernists like Ray Johnson, Francis Ponge and the Oulipo, the name Al Ackerman is a pseudonym most likely alluding to the science fiction editor and collector Forrest J. Ackerman. Al Ackerman's writing has dealt playfully, if obsessively, with themes of madness and weird phenomena. His visual work is also in the tradition of black humor, often including a trademark character, the hebephrenic, with a wide upper lip and two protruding teeth. His voluminous mail art output was anthologized in The Blaster Omnibus and given a one-man show at the Chela Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland. Other books include Let Me Eat Massive Pieces of Clay, I Taught My Dog to Shoot a Gun, and Corn and Smoke. Over the past twenty years, he has been mostly frequently published The Lost and Found Times, published by frequent collaborator John M. Bennett, and in the Shattered Wig Review published by Rupert Wondolowski, although his massive body of work is difficult to track due to his regular use of a variety of pseudonyms (which he relates to his childhood love of the pulps), including Eel Leonard, Luther Blissett (a reference to the footballer of the same name), and Swarthy Turk Sellers among many others, as well as regular anonymous and collaborative works. His influence in the 1980s was strongly felt by neoism founder Istvan Kantor, performance artist Andre Stitt, photographer Richard Kern (who published Ackerman's writing in his magazine Dumb Fucker) and musician Genesis P-Orridge who used one of Ackerman's letters as the text of Throbbing Gristle's song \"Hamburger Lady. \" Many of his stories have been made into videos by Steve \"Sleeze\" Steele, and one, about a man who gives his life over to the creation of a garment made of vienna sausages, was given feature-length film treatment by Catherine Pancake under the name The Suit. In 2005 a long playing record of his spoken performances, titled I Am Drunk, was issued. His latest book entitled Misto Peas: Tiny Special Stories, was published in 2009 by Luna Bisonte Productions. The book contains rewordings or \"hacks\" of poet John M. Bennett's writing. He read from this new book at Shattered Wig Nite hosted by Rupert Wondolowski at Baltimore's 14 Karat Cabaret in November 2009. He was a frequent contributor to the Shattered Wig series of performances and publications. He died in Austin, Texas in 2013.

As a member of the Bench, particularly in his tenure as Justice of the Supreme Court, he led the majority on the Court, in the celebrated case of the NPP v Attorney General, to outlaw the official celebration of the 31 December coup as being offensive to the letter and spirit of the democratic Constitution of the Fourth Republic of Ghana. NYB Adade's authoritative opinion in the case remains a landmark in the annals of constitutional interpretation of Ghana. He was a member of NLC legal committee from 1966 to 1967 and Chairman of NLC management agreement from 1967 to 1968. He read the decree dissolving the National Liberation Council in 1969. At the inception of the second republic he was elected as a member of parliament for the Asante Akyim district and appointed Attorney General and Minister for Justice of the republic of Ghana from 14 April 1969 to 1971. He was later appointed as Minister of the Interior from 1971 until 1972 when the Busia government was overthrown by the SMC chaired by General I. K. Acheampong. During the SMC era he joined the famous organisation set up by Akwasi Afrifa to oppose General I. K. Acheampong\u2019s UNIGOV idea \u2013 the Peoples\u2019 Movement for Freedom and Justice (PMFJ), whose General Secretary was Nana Akufo-Addo; the president of the republic of Ghana. The aftermath of the Referendum of April 1978, forced several PMFJ leaders into brief exile until General I. K. Acheampong was overthrown by Lt. General Fred Akuffo. During the third republic Adade was a founding member of the United National Convention a party that broke out of the Progress Party. He was appointed chairman of the commission appointed by the government to probe the Ghana Education Service. He had a nightclub, \"The Jamboree\", at Asafo Kumasi and also formed his own highlife band, \"The Globemasters\", which soon became one of the leading bands of the 1960s in Ghana. Nana Akufo-Addo the current president of the Republic of Ghana paid tribute to him in a speech saying: \"He belongs to a noble generation of men and women who suffered the deprivations of detention and exile to ensure that our nation was set on the path of democratic governance under the rule of law. Our generation, which is today enjoying the benefits of an open society, of free speech and free political activities under constitutional rule, owe him and the others an enormous debt of gratitude for their sense of principle and capacity for sacrifice.

She is best known for performing the first human studies demonstrating the safety of microwave radiation. Adair was born on November 28, 1926, in Arlington, Massachusetts. Adair received her undergraduate degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1948. Adair married Robert K. Adair, a physicist, in 1952. In 1955, she obtained her doctorate from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. She received her Ph. D. in a combination of two fields: sensory psychology and physics. Starting in the 1970s, Adair conducted physiology studies as a fellow at the John B. Pierce Laboratory in New Haven to learn how humans and animals react to heat. This work led her to focus on the controversial area of microwaves and their effect on human health. Experimenting first on squirrel monkeys and then on human volunteers, she concluded that microwave radiation from microwave ovens, cells phones, and power lines is harmless to humans and animals. In 1996, she joined the U. S. Air Force Research Laboratory at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, as a senior scientist studying electromagnetic radiation effects. Adair was a fellow of several scientific societies, including the Bioelectromagnetics Society and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). She served as the secretary-treasure of the former. Adair chaired several IEEE committees, including the Committee on Man and Radiation and the Standards Coordinating Committee. She was a member of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement Committee. In 2007 she was awarded the D'Arsonval Award for Bioelectromagnetics by the Bioelectromagnetics Society.

"}, {"text": "Kenneth Stanley \"Bud\" Adams, Jr. (January 3, 1923 \u2013 October 21, 2013) was the owner of the Tennessee Titans, a National Football League franchise. He was instrumental in the founding and establishment of the former American Football League. Adams became a charter AFL owner with the establishment of the current Titans franchise, which was originally known as the Houston Oilers. He was the senior owner (by time) with his team in the National Football League, a few months ahead of Buffalo Bills' owner Ralph Wilson. Adams also was one of the owners of the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association and the owner of the second Nashville Kats franchise of the Arena Football League. He was elected to the American Football League Hall of Fame, an online site, but as of 2018 is not a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, despite several nominations and an ongoing effort to make him such. Adams had many business interests in the Houston area. A member of the Cherokee Nation who originally made his fortune in the petroleum business, Adams was chairman and CEO of Adams Resources & Energy Inc. , a wholesale supplier of oil and natural gas. He also owned several Lincoln-Mercury automobile franchises. Born in Bartlesville, Oklahoma on January 3, 1923, Adams was the son of K. S. \"Boots\" Adams and Blanch Keeler Adams. He became an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation by virtue of his maternal line. Two of his great-grandmothers were Cherokee women who married European-American men: Nelson Carr and George B. Keeler, who played roles in trade and oil in early Oklahoma. Keeler drilled the first commercial oil well, near the Caney River. Adams's father succeeded the founder Frank Phillips as president of Phillips Petroleum Company in 1939. Adams's uncle William Wayne Keeler, CEO of Phillips Petroleum Company for years, was appointed Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation by President Harry S. Truman in 1949 and served through 1971, when the Cherokee were allowed to hold their own elections. Keeler was then democratically elected and served until 1975. Adams's ancestors include other prominent Cherokee leaders. Adams graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1940 after lettering in three sports. After a brief stint at Menlo College, he transferred to the University of Kansas (KU), where he played briefly on the varsity football team as he completed an engineering degree. In his lone season on the Jayhawk football team, he was a teammate of politician Bob Dole. During World War II, Adams served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater of operations, attaining the rank of Lieutenant (Junior Grade). After the war, he returned to KU for additional studies and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Shortly after his 1946 discharge, Adams was on a trip in which his plane was fogbound in Houston, Texas. He liked the area and decided to settle there. In 1947, Adams launched a wildcatting firm, ADA Oil Company, that eventually grew into Adams Resources & Energy. The company's basketball team was an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) powerhouse, finishing third nationally in 1956. Adams soon became interested in owning an NFL team. In 1959, Adams and fellow Texas oilman Lamar Hunt tried to buy the struggling Chicago Cardinals and move them to Texas. When that effort failed, he tried to get an expansion team, only to be turned down. A few days after returning to Houston, Adams got a call from Hunt proposing an entirely new football league. They met several times that spring, and Hunt convinced Adams to field a team in Houston. In Hunt's view, a regional rivalry between Hunt's Dallas Texans (now the Kansas City Chiefs) and a Houston team would be critical to the league's growth. On August 3, Adams and Hunt held a press conference in Adams's boardroom to announce formation of the new league, which was formally named the American Football League. Although less popularly associated with the formation of the AFL than Hunt, Adams was likely nearly as crucial to the league's success. Both he and Hunt were more financially stable than some of the other early owners. Adams helped establish the league by fighting and winning the battle with the NFL for LSU's All-American Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon. Particularly crucial to the league's early years was Adams's relationship with Harry Wismer, original owner of the league's New York franchise, the Titans. For their first three years, the Titans played in the deteriorating old Polo Grounds. The team was mostly derided or ignored by the New York City media. Adams's help was essential in keeping Wismer's team in business until it could be sold to more financially capable ownership and moved into Shea Stadium as the Jets. Adams's team was the best of the new teams during the early period of the AFL. It won the first two championship games behind the quarterbacking and kicking of former Bears reject George Blanda. His team played in a total of four AFL Championship games. Adams is a member of the American Football League Hall of Fame. Along with wealthy Houston businessman T. C. Morrow, Adams owned the Houston Mavericks, a franchise in the American Basketball Association, from 1967 through 1969. The team was not successful in Houston, and its attendance was among the lowest in the league. After the 1968\u20131969 season, under new ownership, the Mavericks moved to Charlotte and became the Carolina Cougars. Adams and the other AFL owners received a tremendous boost in credibility and net worth in 1966 with the merger of the AFL with and into the NFL. It was effective with the 1970 season. In 1968 Adams moved his team into the Astrodome, which since 1965 had been the home of the Houston Astros of baseball's National League. While the Astrodome ameliorated the hot, humid climate, it had several drawbacks as a venue for the Oilers. Despite being almost completely round, the Astrodome's football sight lines left much to be desired. The seats near the 50-yard line, usually the most desirable (and expensive), were the farthest from the field of play, while those nearest the action were otherwise-undesirable seats in the end zone. Additionally, the Astrodome seated only about 50,000 for football, just barely over the minimum seating capacity for an NFL stadium. By the early 1980s, it was the smallest venue in the NFL. Adams chafed at being the Astrodome's \"secondary\" tenant. He knew his position was unlikely to change as long as the Astros were playing 81 home games and his team was playing eight. Adams was initially hailed as a hero in Houston for making the city a major-league town, but his popularity tailed off during the Oilers' early NFL years. His tendency to micromanage the Oilers brought considerable scrutiny since he had no background in the sport. For instance, all expenditures over $200 required his personal approval. In the late 1970s the Oilers rose again to football prominence. Their coach, O. A. \"Bum\" Phillips, who dressed, spoke, and acted much like the popular image of a rancher, was well-known and popular. After the Oilers lost to eventual Super Bowl champions in three consecutive years, two consecutive AFC championship game losses to the Steelers, followed by a Wild Card loss to the Oakland Raiders, Adams fired Phillips. The team fell off and would not be a serious contender again until the late-1980s. Most of the Houston sporting public blamed Adams. This era of rotation between mediocrity and disaster was to last several years. In 1987, Adams threatened to move the Oilers to Jacksonville, Florida (now the home to the Jaguars) unless significant improvements were made to the Astrodome. Harris County, which owns the Astrodome, responded with a $67 million renovation that added 10,000 more seats, a new Astroturf carpet and 65 luxury boxes. Adams promised that with the new improvements, he would keep the team in Houston for 10 years. These improvements were funded by increases in property taxes and the doubling of the hotel tax, as well as bonds to be paid over 30 years. (As of 2011, Harris County and its taxpayers are still paying off the debt from the Astrodome renovations. ) That same year, the Oilers seemed to right themselves on the field. They made the AFC playoffs every year from then until 1993, but each time they fell short of making it to the Super Bowl. After Adams made good on a threat to hold a fire sale if the Oilers did not make the Super Bowl after the 1993 season, the Oilers finished with the worst record in franchise history a year later. They would be barely competitive for the rest of their stay in Houston. By the mid-1990s, several NFL teams had new stadiums built largely or entirely with public funding, and several more deals had been agreed to. These new venues featured amenities such as \"club seating\" and other potential revenue streams that were not part of the NFL's default revenue-sharing arrangements. Due to this, Adams began to lobby Mayor Bob Lanier for a new stadium. However, Lanier turned down the request almost out of hand. Lanier knew that Houstonians were not willing to spend money for a brand-new stadium less than a decade after helping pay for heavily renovating the Astrodome. Adams then began to shop the team to other cities. He had taken particular notice of the offer made by Nashville to the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League to become the primary tenant of a new arena then under construction in downtown Nashville\u2014what is now Bridgestone Arena. While this deal was never consummated (Nashville eventually received an expansion team, the Nashville Predators), Adams wondered what sort of offer he might receive for a venue for his NFL team. After Adams met several times with then-Nashville mayor Phil Bredesen, they announced a deal to bring the Oilers to Nashville for the 1998 season to a new 68,000-seat stadium (originally called Adelphia Coliseum, now known as Nissan Stadium). It was to be built largely with city and state funds, across the Cumberland River from downtown Nashville. Nashville opponents of this arrangement forced the issue to a referendum vote; it passed easily, with over 57% of those voting in favor. When the move was announced shortly after the end of the 1995 season, Adams's opponents in Houston attempted to block the move. The biggest example of this was when then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, whose district included portions of Houston and its suburbs, introduced a bill in Congress banning the move. However, it did not pass. Other opponents of the move filed their own lawsuits, but all were dismissed. By the start of the 1996 season, support for the Oilers had practically vanished. The Oilers played most of their games before crowds of fewer than 20,000, and they looked even smaller due to the spacious configuration of the Astrodome. The crowds were so quiet that some of the few in attendance, watching on television, or listening on radio could hear all of the action on the field, including play calling, collisions, and the players talking to one another. In addition, the Oilers' radio network in Texas, formerly statewide, was reduced to a single station in Houston and a few affiliates in Tennessee. Adams, the city, the county and the NFL were unwilling to let this continue for another season. As a result, Harris County agreed to let the Oilers out of their lease to enable the move to Tennessee a year earlier than planned. The new Nashville-based stadium's opening was forced back a year, due to the time necessary to get the appropriate enabling measure on the ballot in Nashville. As a result, Adams had difficulty finding a suitable temporary home for the renamed Tennessee Oilers (\"Tennessee\" was used instead of \"Nashville\" to appeal to the broader region). The largest stadium in the Nashville area at the time, Vanderbilt Stadium on the campus of Vanderbilt University, seated only 41,000\u2014too small for anything beyond preseason games. Further, the Oilers were concerned that Vanderbilt refused to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages in the college stadium, which are a source of considerable revenue for NFL teams. The closest NFL-sized stadium to Nashville at the time was the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, three hours east of Nashville. However, Adams rejected it because at 102,000 seats, it would have been nearly impossible to sell out. The league and the Oilers decided to use Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, three-and-a-half hours west of Nashville, until the new stadium in Nashville could be completed. The team would be based in Nashville and commute to Memphis for games\u2014essentially saddling the Oilers with 32 road games for the next two years. Even with the team's relocation, Adams himself continued to live in Houston up until his death, only traveling to Tennessee for games. The 1997 season in Memphis proved to be almost as disastrous as the prior years in the Astrodome, largely because the arrangement was very unpopular in both Memphis and Nashville. Whether from disappointment at their city's numerous failures to get professional football in its own right, their longtime rivalry with Nashville, mere lack of interest in professional football in general (the Canadian Football League's Memphis Mad Dogs, who had played in Memphis two years prior, was one of the worst attended teams in that league as well) or general disgust at the prospect of a team that was only there for a temporary stay, Memphians showed no interest in the Oilers. Nashvillians balked at traveling 210 miles to see \"their\" team, especially since Interstate 40 between the two cities was undergoing a major reconstruction near Memphis. As a result, the Oilers played before some of the smallest NFL crowds since the 1950s. None of the first seven games in Memphis attracted more than 27,000 fans\u2014not even half of the Liberty Bowl's capacity of 62,000. Despite the problems, Adams initially intended to stick it out. But, only one game, the finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers, attracted a larger crowd than could have been accommodated at Vanderbilt. Although 50,677 people showed up, the crowd appeared to be composed of at least half, and as many as three-fourths, Steeler fans. As a result, Adams scrapped plans to play the 1998 season at the Liberty Bowl, and opted to play at Vanderbilt instead. Only four of the eight regular-season home games at Vanderbilt sold out for the 1998 season. The move to Tennessee was beginning to be seen as a complete failure. To make matters worse, a major tornado had hit downtown Nashville area, tearing directly through the new stadium's construction site and causing two tower cranes to collapse. The completion of the new stadium would seemingly be delayed again; the contractors managed to compensate however, ultimately allowing the team to move into their new stadium. Oilers players' participation in the post-tornado cleanup proved to be a public-relations bonanza for Adams and his team, as did Adams's large charitable contribution for relief for the storm's victims. Due to this, there were public suggestions to rename the team the \"Tennessee Twisters\". With the team at its new stadium, the following year was one of major changes. During the 1998 season, Adams announced that the team would change its name to one better suited for its new home, the addition of navy blue to the team's color scheme, and that the team would be considered the continuation of the former Oilers franchise, allowing them to retain all their team records. He announced he would open a Hall of Fame at the new stadium to honor the greatest players from both the Houston era and the present Tennessee era. A blue-ribbon committee selected \"Titans\" to be the team's new name. Upon gaining their new identity and new stadium, the newly christened Tennessee Titans received a huge boost in support and excitement among the Nashville community. The Titans proceeded to finish the 1999 regular season with a 13\u20133 record, qualifying as a wild-card team. In their first-round playoff game against the Buffalo Bills, they won on a wild, controversial last-minute kickoff return play called the \"Home Run Throwback\" by the special teams coaching staff. Due to the last minute game-deciding nature of this play and the accompanying radio play call by Titans Radio's Mike Keith, it is more commonly known as the \"Music City Miracle\". The kickoff, caught by fullback Lorenzo Neal, was handed off to tight end Frank Wycheck, who made a lateral pass to wide receiver Kevin Dyson. Dyson ran the ball 75 yards down the sideline while Buffalo's defense had converged on Wycheck on the other side of the field. The officials ruled it a lateral on the field and confirmed it was a lateral after reviewing the play via officials' in-game replay review. Following their wild-card victory, the team went on to win two subsequent playoff games and appeared in its first-ever Super Bowl, in Atlanta's Georgia Dome. They lost 23\u201316 to the St. Louis Rams, having come just one yard short of a touchdown on the game's final play, creating one of the most thrilling conclusions in Super Bowl history. The unlikely run that Tennessee sustained in their first season as the Titans has proven to be the high-water mark for the Titans' on-field success since. The team won the former AFC Central Division the next year, but fell short of the Super Bowl. They then won the AFC South in the 2002 season with an 11-5 record and made it as far as the Conference Championship, falling to a high powered, hard hitting Oakland Raiders team at the McAfee Coliseum. After the 2003 season the team advanced only to the AFC Divisional Playoffs, losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. 2005 was the team's worst season since its arrival in Tennessee, and it finished with an overall record of 4\u201312. They would not return to the playoffs again until 2007, when they sealed a playoff berth on the last day of the season. 2008 would see the Titans climb to the top of the AFC with a 13-3 record, but they were then knocked out of the playoffs by the Ravens in controversial fashion. During the Ravens' game-winning drive, a 'Delay of Game' was not called after the play clock had hit 0 for several seconds, which enabled the Ravens to go on to kick the game-winning field goal. In the following season, the Titans had a woeful 0-6 start, including a 59-0 beating by the Patriots. The team then managed to finish at . 500, after a change at quarterback, likely saving the job of long-time coach Jeff Fisher. On November 15, 2009, Adams was caught on video displaying an obscene gesture towards the Buffalo bench after the Titans routed the Bills 41-14. Commissioner Roger Goodell, who happened to be attending the game, fined him $250,000. Afterwards, Adams remarked \"Oh, I knew I was going to get in trouble for that. I was just so happy we won. \" In 2001, Adams purchased the rights to operate an Arena Football League expansion franchise in Nashville for a reported $4 million. He found it impossible at first to negotiate a favorable lease for the use of the Gaylord Entertainment Center (now called Bridgestone Arena) from that facility's primary tenant and operator, the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators. A previous AFL team (the original Nashville Kats owned by Mark Bloom) had been forced by an unfavorable lease agreement to leave Nashville and move to Atlanta (with this team thus becoming known as the Georgia Force). This lease agreement resulted in sizable financial losses despite average attendance of over 10,000 per home game for the original Kats. Motivated by bitter memories of being a secondary tenant at the Astrodome, Adams briefly considered either financing the renovation of the Nashville Municipal Auditorium for use as an indoor football venue, building an entirely new facility with a seating capacity of 12,000 or so (dropped when Adams was convinced that the potential $30 million price tag for such a building he had apparently initially been quoted was wildly optimistic), or expanding the Titans' existing indoor practice facility (at \"Baptist Sports Park\", named for a local hospital) for use as an Arena venue. As negotiations with the Predators dragged on and contingency planning continued, the Arena Football League extended his option on the new Nashville franchise at least twice. By 2004, Adams and the Predators finally hammered out a mutually acceptable lease agreement. Immediately afterward, it was announced that the new Nashville Kats franchise would begin play in the Arena Football League's 2005 season. Late in 2004 it was announced that country singer Tim McGraw had bought into the Kats franchise as a minority owner. This second Kats franchise reclaimed the name, logo, and Nashville history of the earlier franchise as its own (The original Kats franchise continued to operate as the Georgia Force until folding in 2008; similarly, that franchise was reincarnated in 2011 when the existing AFL team Alabama Vipers relocated to the Atlanta area and assumed the Georgia Force identity). As a result of limited on-field success and the subsequent drop in fan support and ticket sales, Adams announced in October 2007 that the Kats would immediately cease operations. Adams was an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation. He had served on the executive committee of the Cherokee National Historical Society. He attended River Oaks Baptist Church in Houston. He and his wife Nancy Neville Adams were married for 62 years, until her death in February 2009 at the age of 84. They had two daughters, Susan and Amy, and a son, Kenneth S. Adams III, each of whom (and their children) are registered Cherokee. Their son died in June 1987 at the age of 29 from apparent suicide. Adams died of natural causes at his home in Houston at age 90 in 2013. His body was found in his River Oaks home after police were called for a welfare check. At the time of his death, Adams's 409 wins were the most of any current NFL owner. He gained his 400th career victory in the 2011 season finale when his Titans defeated the team that replaced his Oilers in Houston, the Texans. His franchise made 21 playoff appearances in 53 seasons, eighth among NFL teams since 1960. Ownership of the Titans is now controlled by the consortium of the children and grandchildren of Bud (under the banner of KSA Industries)-- daughters Susie Smith and Amy Strunk, grandsons Kenneth S. Adams IV and Barclay Adams, and their mother Susan Lewis. Strunk owns the largest share of the team, 1/3, and is the team\u2019s controlling owner.

Abdnor served in the United States Army during World War II and then graduated from the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln in 1945 where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He was a member of the South Dakota Senate from 1957 to 1969. A common, decent, plain spoken man,\" he was affectionately known as \"the people's Senator. \" He was also described as a \"nice-guy public servant\" with a \"down-home, warm and fuzzy way. His staff considered him to be a friend as well as an honorable mentor and public servant. Like his South Dakota Congressional colleague James Abourezk, he was a second-generation Lebanese-American and second U. S. Senator of Lebanese descent after Abourezk, as well. From 1946 to 1948, James Abdnor worked as a teacher and coach. Abdnor was chief clerk of the State Legislature in the early 1950s. Abdnor was the 30th Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota from 1969 to 1971, and unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the House of Representatives in 1970. In 1972, he was elected to the House of Representatives as a Republican. Abdnor ran in the 1980 election against three-term incumbent and 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern for the United States Senate. Abdnor claimed McGovern was out of touch with the state and unseated him by a large margin. During his term as a senator, Abdnor served on the Appropriations Committee and chaired three subcommittees, including the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee. In 1986, after winning by a wide margin a bruising re-election primary campaign against then Governor Bill Janklow, Abdnor narrowly lost his Senate seat to then-Representative Tom Daschle. He served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration from 1987 to 1989, and served in an advisory capacity for John Thune's successful campaign against Daschle in 2004. Abdnor's accomplishments included authorization of the Grassropes irrigation project and the Walworth, Edmunds, Brown (WEB) rural water system, reauthorization of the Belle Fourche irrigation project, and the inclusion of oats (of which South Dakota is a major producer) in the farm program. As a fiscal conservative, on April 2, 1984, he introduced S. 2516, the Deficit Reduction Act, a forerunner to the Gramm\u2013Rudman\u2013Hollings Balanced Budget Act. As chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Water Resources, he exerted leadership in passage of legislation requiring cost-sharing for Federal water development projects. His interest in chairing the subcommittee was spawned by the importance of water to South Dakota's primary industry, agriculture, and the fact the state had been promised irrigation development in trade for inundation of its Missouri River bottom land behind massive dams in order to provide flood control and navigation benefits to downstream states. John Thune had been a member of Senator Abdnor's staff. Other notable members of Abdnor's staff who went on to fill important public service roles include John Hamre, Undersecretary of Defense; Jeff Trandahl, Clerk of the House; Bruce Knight, Undersecretary, Marketing and Regulatory Programs, U.

He played Alfred Pennyworth on Birds of Prey, Justin Pitt (Elaine Benes's boss) during the sixth season of Seinfeld, Rupert Cavanaugh (Ian Hainsworth's butler) in Desperate Housewives, Professor Crumbs in Wizards of Waverly Place, and Palpatine in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Abercrombie was born on 11 September 1934 in Grays, Essex, England. He began his theatrical career during the Blitz in World War II. After his footwork years during which he earned Bronze, Silver and Gold medals in stage dancing, he performed in London, Scotland, Ireland, and the Netherlands. He moved to the United States at age 17. He made his American stage debut in 1955 in a production of Stalag 17 with Jason Robards and Jules Munshin. Many plays in summer stock, regional, and off-Broadway followed in a variety of theatrical offerings, from revues to Shakespeare (in a particularly low period, he worked as a magician's assistant for $10 a performance). In 1957, he was drafted into the United States Army and stationed in West Germany as part of Special Services, where he directed the continental premiere of Separate Tables. In the United States, he went to California for a backers' audition, which went nowhere, but he began a long film and television career. He received awards for his work in Sweet Prince with Keir Dullea; Teeth 'N'smiles; A Doll's House with Linda Purl; and The Arcata Promise, opposite Anthony Hopkins. He received acclaim for the one-man show Jean Cocteau\u2014A Mirror Image. Abercrombie was known to cult film audiences as Wiseman in the comedy horror film Army of Darkness (1993).

Supervising director Dave Filoni said that Ian was very excited that Darth Sidious finally was going to be seen in person and not as a hologram anymore; during Celebration VI, Filoni also mentioned that before his death, Ian did record for most of Season Five as the character, but did not finish, so actor Tim Curry was brought in to voice Palpatine. However, Abercrombie also voiced the character in the Clovis story arc of the Lost Missions (Season Six) since it was originally a part of the Season Four, and later the Season Five, line-up. Thus, it was finished before his death. This was his final released work both on the series and in his life, shown in 2014. He was honoured with a message of \"In memory of Ian Abercrombie\" at the beginning of Season 5, Episode 16 \"The Lawless\".

Abhayavardhana was born in Kandy where his maternal grandfather was an Anglican vicar - at a time when the Church of England was the established church. His father was a government servant and a pillar of the establishment. Abhayavardhana was educated at St Thomas' College, Mt. Lavinia. His upbringing, being anglicised in culture and religion, was typical of the colonial middle-class and hence remote from the mass of Sinhala-speaking Buddhist people. He and his fellow matriculation student were once posed the question 'Would you have been better off under your own king?' by their teacher, in response to which he began to ponder upon nationalism and British colonial rule. At fifteen he renounced Christianity and became an atheist. In 1936 he joined University College, Colombo where he read liberal arts and came under the influence of E. F. C. Ludowyk and Doric de Souza, who had Marxist sympathies. He went on to complete his colonial education at the Colombo Law College. Abhayavardhana's first exposure to radical politics was the Bracegirdle incident, in which the Colonial Government sought to deport an Australian labour activist. He attended a mass meeting at Galle Face Green on 5 May 1937 at Bracegirdle made a dramatic appearance and a stirring speech before being whisked away into hiding. At the time, his father was the Chief Clerk in the office of Governor Reginald Stubbs, who sought the deportation and against whom this meeting was directed. He organised the Mount Lavinia Debating Society, which invited such speakers as Dr. Colvin R. de Silva and J. R. Jayewardene. Abhayavardhana was recruited to the Lanka Sama Samaja Party in 1940 by Esmond Wickremasinghe (later to be father of Ranil Wickremasinghe). He became part of the clandestine section of the LSSP that was established, in anticipation of its proscription, to work underground. After the party leaders were imprisoned and escaped to India he joined them in exile there (disguised as an Anglican priest) and worked in the Independence movement. He became a member of the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI) and began his career as a writer. His two pamphlets 'The Saboteur Strategy of the Constructive Programme' and on the Quit India Movement of the Congress Party were considered to be seminal theoretical works. When the main LSSP leaders returned to Sri Lanka after the war, Abhayawardhana was among the Sama Samajists who remained in India. He worked on the fortnightly New Spark in Bombay, later moving to Chennai. He became General Secretary of the Socialist Party which was created by the fusion in 1948 of the BLPI with the Congress Socialist Party. He moved to New Delhi where he was editor of the Socialist Appeal and contributor to the Hindustan Standard. He spent two years in Hyderabad editing Mankind before returning to New Delhi where he began the critical journal Maral. In 1959 Abhayavardhana married Kusala Fernando and returned to Sri Lanka in 1960. Abhayavardhana is credited with formulating the classification of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as a petty bourgeois party, which was the ideological and theoretical foundation of the LSSP Coalition with that party in 1964. After this, he promoted an alliance with the SLFP and the Communist Party, which finally emerged with the signing of the Common Programme of the United Front in 1968. Abhayavardhana started The Nation as an English organ of the United Front, serving as its editor. When the United Front formed a government in 1970 Hector served as Chairman of the People's Bank under Dr. N. M. Perera, the Finance Minister. After the front broke up in 1975, he founded the Socialist Nation. He also served on the Educational Bureau of the LSSP and was a long-standing member of the Politburo. In August 1992 Abhayavardhana, along with Vivienne Goonewardena and Bernard Soysa was a guest of honour at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Quit India movement in New Delhi.

He played as a defender from 1985 until 2001. He spent nine years with Liverpool before moving to their city rivals Everton in 1995. He went on to win the FA Cup with Everton, having previously won an FA Cup runners-up medal in 1988 with Liverpool. He later played for Derby County, Hull City, Sheffield United, Birmingham City, Wycombe Wanderers, Blackpool and ended his playing career in the USA with Long Island Rough Riders. He moved into coaching and managed Liverpool F. C. Reserves, and then spent a year as manager of Stockport County. Ablett died on 1 January 2012, following a 16-month battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, at his home in Tarleton, Lancashire. He was 46 years old. Ablett joined hometown club Liverpool as an apprentice upon leaving St Margaret's Church of England High School in 1982. He made his Liverpool debut on 20 December 1986 in a goalless league away draw with Charlton Athletic, when regular defenders Barry Venison and Mark Lawrenson were absent due to injury. He made five more appearances that season, scoring what would be his only goal for the club on 18 April 1987 in a 3\u20130 home league victory over Nottingham Forest. Alongside experienced players in defence, such as Gary Gillespie, Steve Nicol and skipper Alan Hansen, Ablett helped Liverpool win the League championship and reach the 1988 FA Cup Final. Ablett only collected a runners-up medal in the latter competition due to Liverpool's shock 1\u20130 defeat by Wimbledon. In 1988\u201389, Liverpool made it to their second consecutive FA Cup final. This time they were successful, after a 3\u20132 victory over Merseyside rivals Everton. They lost the League title, however, to Arsenal with practically the last kick of the season. Ablett was now firmly established as the club's regular left back, missing just three league games that season. Ablett flitted in and out of the squad over the next year, relegated in the pecking order following the arrival of Glenn Hysen and the progress of Steve Staunton and David Burrows. He was used more frequently as a central defender rather than left full-back after Hansen began suffering more with injuries. Eventually, he took the central role more often following the arrival of left back Burrows from West Bromwich Albion and won the League again with Liverpool in 1990. Kenny Dalglish resigned as Liverpool manager on 22 February 1991, and his successor, Graeme Souness, decided to sell Ablett for \u00a3750,000 to Everton in January 1992, after 147 appearances for the Reds. Ironically, his departure came at a time when he was getting more first team opportunities than he had done since the 1988\u201389 season. He made his league debut for the club on 19 January 1992 in a 1\u20131 draw with Nottingham Forest at Goodison Park. Ablett won the FA Cup with Everton in 1995, becoming the only player to win the competition with both Merseyside teams. However, he lost his place at left-back to Andy Hinchcliffe in the 1995\u201396 season, who had been moved back into defence after spending most of the previous season playing left midfield with Ablett behind him. Ablett went on to make 128 league appearances and score five goals for Everton, and later went on to have a brief loan spell with Sheffield United before making a permanent move to Birmingham City for \u00a3390,000, joining them at the same time as established Premiership players Steve Bruce and Mike Newell, as new manager Trevor Francis set about building a side capable of challenging for a place in the Premier League. In three years with the Blues, he scored twice, with goals against Swindon Town in the league and Leeds United in the FA Cup. He was released by Birmingham City manager Trevor Francis in 1999, and after short spells with Blackpool (playing under former Anfield teammate Steve McMahon, scoring once against Luton Town) and Wycombe Wanderers, he signed for American A-League side Long Island Rough Riders in June 2000. In February 2002, at the age of 36, Ablett was taken on trial by Grimsby Town. In 2006, Ablett appeared as a substitute in Replay 86, a charity match staged in aid of The Marina Dalglish Appeal, which pitted the Liverpool and Everton sides that had contested the 1986 FA Cup Final against each other one more. Ablett's inclusion was curious, because although on Liverpool's books at the time of the Final, he did not actually make his debut for the club until the December of that year. Regardless, his contribution ensured Liverpool won the game 1\u20130. In the summer of 2002, Ablett moved into coaching, taking up a post as the coach of Everton's under-17 side. He worked as part of the club's youth academy for several years until the summer of 2006, when he returned to his first club, taking the vacant job of Liverpool F. C. Reserves team coach, replacing Paco Herrera. The same career opportunities were not available at Everton with Andy Holden firmly established as reserve-team manager. In April 2008, under Ablett's guidance, Liverpool's reserves were crowned champions of the Premier Reserve League North, and the following month they became national champions after a play-off final victory against Aston Villa's reserves. In July 2008 he completed his final UEFA coaching qualification by obtaining the UEFA Pro Licence. Ablett's son, Fraser (born 1991), signed for Chester City and has since played for Colwyn Bay since the demise of Chester City. He currently plays for Widnes Vikings FC in the North West Counties Football League Division 1. On 28 May 2009, Liverpool announced that Ablett would be leaving his position as reserve team manager. On 8 July 2009, Ablett was announced as the new Stockport County manager. The club was in administration for the whole of the 2009\u201310 season, during which his team managed only five league wins. The club also went on a record consecutive losing run of games. He left the club on 17 June 2010 when the 2015 Group took ownership of the club.

He studied in the class of Camil Ressu at the Academia de Belle-Arte in Bucharest, and ended up then at the Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest, as a student of Istv\u00e1n Sz\u0151nyi. He spent five years as a soldier in the Hungarian army, then as prisoner of war in Russia. He was a teacher at the Kolozsv\u00e1r Academy of Fine Arts, actually University of Art and Design Cluj-Napoca, Romania, then he worked as the head of the department and a master for generations of artists between 1949 and 1983 [2]. He has been a Kolozsv\u00e1r resident until 2008, and lives since then in Budapest. B\u00e9la Nagy Abodi is one of the most universal representatives of modern Hungarian and Romanian fine arts. He is a typically Hungarian and at the same time, a distinctively Transylvanian artist. He is a highly qualified, conscious artist, but at the same time a sensitive, true colourist, \"a painter of the soul\". His marvellous artwork bridges over several artistic periods and expressive systems of forms, though it constitutes a distinct entity: Abodi's dominant artistic character can be immediately traced in his diverse and always renewing oeuvre. He is a daring experimentalist, a persistent seeker who never strains after visual artifices or unnatural stylistic unity for his own sake. Abodi is the archetype of a professional and intellectual creator who is in possession of a complete range of professional tools and who is endowed with superior knowledge. His abundant lifework is a mine of deeply sympathizing, socially committed, objective-realist or dramatic and shockingly expressive depictions, at other times pictorial satires deploying the weapons of irony or even dead-on sarcasm, and the master-like composition of absurd and grotesque figurality. His later works are characterised by monumental pictorial architectures, genius \"full orchestra\" structures, figural-decorative compositions that are inspired by Hungarian folk art, and then geometrical-abstract or abstract-expressionist representations. The pictures he painted at a later age are staggeringly clear artistic and deeply human conclusions: they are the pictures of an age, genius clinical aspects of the period. Abodi is mostly known as an artist who is wrestling with questions of human fate and as a painter of compositions that create master-like systems of pictures. Besides his artistic activity, Abodi is a devoted public personality who has been fighting throughout his life for the survival of the Hungarian population of Transylvania \u2013 including their lawful community rights, uniquely rich culture and education at all levels. He did so as a leader of Hungarian social and professional organisations (vice-president of the Association of university and college students of Sz\u00e9kely Land \u2013 SZEFHE after 1939, honorary president of the Barab\u00e1s Mikl\u00f3s C\u00e9h (Mikl\u00f3s Barab\u00e1s Guild) after 1990, etc. ), as a university student (Bucharest, Budapest), as a university lecturer and leader, as a prestigious artist, and as a master of the written and spoken word. His work of art can be best studied by reading Andor Bajor Bajor Andor's marvellous book, the Abodi monograph that has been published by Kriterion in 1986, as well as by consulting \"Who is Who 2011\", the thick catalogue of his collection exhibited in the Museum of Transylvanian Fine Arts in Cluj-Napoca ( Kolozsv\u00e1r) (B\u00e1nffy Palace) in 2004.

He was associated with Sheikh Hossein Lankarani for many years and was very influenced by him. Abolhassani had great interest to Sheikh Fazlullah Nuri that led to his fascination with the Sheikh and had authoring several books. Abolhassani's opinion about Doctor Mosaddeq was positive but about Doctor Shariati was nasty and extremely protested about him and this led to his disciples have such views. Abolhassani was published Morteza Motahhari's notes against Ali Shariati for the first time in 1984. Abolhassani's books use as reference in books written by scholars on Islam and history of Iran. Ramin Jahanbegloo in book \"Iran: Between Tradition and Modernity\" referred to Abolhassani's book as extremist views of Shia.

Nicholas Markoro and Sohrab Behdad and Farhad Nomani in books \"Islam and public policy\", \"Islam and the Everyday World: Public policy dilemmas\" and \"Class And Labor in Iran: Did the Revolution Matter\" introduced Abolhassani's opinion about Motahhari as same as the Iran's government's point of view. Sohrab Behdad and Saeed Rahnama in book \"Iran After the Revolution: Crisis of an Islamic\" based on the abolhassani's book \"martyr Motahhari Exposer of conspiracy\" criticized the Motahhari's comments about Shariati as the views of the Islamic Seminary of Qom.

"}, {"text": "Stephen Irwin Abrams (15 July 1938 in Chicago, Illinois \u2013 21 November 2012) was an American scholar of parapsychology and a cannabis rights activist who was a long-standing resident of the United Kingdom. He is best known for sponsoring and authoring the full page advertisement petitioning for cannabis law reform which appeared in The Times on 24 July 1967. Abrams was born and raised in Chicago, and began his undergraduate studies at Shimer College, where he enrolled in 1954. Then as now, Shimer offered an early entrance program for gifted students wishing to leave high school early. Abrams subsequently transferred to the University of Chicago, where he served as head of the Parapsychology Department from 1957 to 1960. He also became a \"charter associate\" of the Parapsychological Association. Abrams was an Advanced Student at St. Catherine's College of Oxford University from 1960 to 1967. He headed a parapsychological laboratory in the University's Department of Biometry, investigating extrasensory perception. In January 1967, the content of an article by Abrams \"The Oxford Scene and the Law\", intended as a contribution to a forthcoming book The Book of Grass was republished, without his permission, in The People Sunday newspaper. The article was a balanced reasoning on the social and personal effects of cannabis use and its repression. The article observed that under current laws cannabis users were punished more severely than heroin users. Cannabis smoking was regarded as a crime but heroin addiction was treated as an illness. Doctors had the right to prescribe heroin. The Court might send a cannabis smoker to prison and send a heroin user to a doctor. Presented in the sensationalist manner for which the paper was known, the story emphasized Abrams claim that 500 of Oxford's student body were cannabis users. The story spread. Headlines like \"Smoke more pot. It's safer than beer\", appeared in the popular press. On 1 February, the same day as long clarifying letter from him was printed in The Daily Telegraph, Abrams announced, via the pages of student newspaper Cherwell, the formation of SOMA, an acronym for the Society of Mental Awareness, as a drug research project. Two weeks later, on 15 February 1967, Abrams gave evidence before the University Committee on Student Health, which agreed to pursue his suggestion that the Home Secretary be prevailed upon to institute an inquiry. After the committee's published report received national press coverage, on 7 April 1967 home secretary Roy Jenkins appointed a \"sub-committee on hallucinogens\" to be chaired by Baroness Wootton to report to the Advisory Council on Drug Dependence, itself appointed four months earlier in December 1966. Public awareness had been increased by the February arrests of Keith Richards and Mick Jagger on drug charges. In the midst of Abrams campaign in Oxford, on March 1, 1967 activist Hoppy had organized a happening in Oxford that had turned into an impromptu \"pot protest\". Swelled by rowdy participants from Oxford Polytechnic's rag week, the event gained national coverage. Hoppy himself, a member of the editorial board of the underground newspaper International Times, had been arrested for cannabis possession the previous December, after police raided his London flat. Although the amount was small, he had a previous conviction, so this was a serious matter. Out on bail, Hoppy went on to organize the massive 14 Hour Technicolor Dream multimedia event at Alexandra Palace on April 29. In his drug case - despite having no defense - he insisted on pleading 'Not Guilty', elected for trial by jury, and lectured the court on the iniquity of the law. Needless to say he was found guilty. On June 1, 1967 he was sentenced to 9 months in prison by a judge who called him a \"pest to society\". He rapidly became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre and a 'Free Hoppy' movement was born. On 2 June, at a gathering of Hoppy supporters, Abrams launched the idea of a SOMA advertisement in The Times petitioning for reform. The idea was that this could serve the double purpose of raising awareness of Hoppy's case and to influence the Wootton Committee, who everyone thought was going to legalise cannabis use. Barry Miles introduced Abrams to Paul McCartney who was persuaded to anonymously donate the \u20a41,800 cost. McCartney had recently blurted to the press about his LSD use. Controversy raged over lyrics suggestive of drug use on the Sgt. Pepper's album, released on 1 June . After word got out of his backing of the advertisement his support wavered. Abrams was able to convince McCartney that associating The Beatles with the cannabis cause could serve to direct all the attention in a positive direction. The space was booked for The Times of Monday 24 July 1967, and Abrams set about recruiting signatories. He was helped by circumstances. On 29 June 1967, the sentencing of Richards and Jagger to lengthy jail sentences precipitated spontaneous protests on Fleet Street outside the offices of the News of the World, widely seen as having instigated the police action after Jagger had threatened them with a libel action over drug allegations earlier in the year. The protests met with violent police responses, including the use of dogs. Jagger and Richards were freed on bail the next day, Friday 30 June. At midnight that day the entire crowd at underground club UFO and many others, including Abrams, again marched to the News of the World to demonstrate. After a third night of protests, again met with police violence, Abrams was among those whose picture appeared on the News of the World's front page on 2 July. The next big event was a \"Legalize Pot Rally\" at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park on Sunday 16 July. A permit having been refused for a larger event, the protesters led by Abrams \u2013 and including speakers Allen Ginsberg, Caroline Coon, Stokely Carmichael, Alexis Korner, Spike Hawkins, Clive Goodwin and Adrian Mitchell \u2013 split into small groups in this famous haven of free speech. Again wide publicity was gained, and International Times commented \"Vast publicity for legalize pot rally. Steve Abrams appears on television with amazing regularity\" The Times advertising department were still apprehensive. Abrams speculated around 1988 that, if it were not for the furor over the Rolling Stones case \u2013 which included the famous William Rees-Mogg editorial Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel? on July 1 \u2013 they would have balked. As it was, at the last moment they demanded payment in advance. Abrams called The Beatles office Apple and assistant Pete Brown came up with a personal cheque to save the day. A week after the advertisement appeared, on 31 July 1967, Keith Richards' cannabis conviction was quashed, and Mick Jagger's prison sentence (for possession of amphetamine tablets) reduced to a conditional discharge. The advertisement appeared in The Times on 24 July 1967. A full page, it stated: 'The law against marijuana is immoral in principle and unworkable in practice. ' The advertisement went on to present medical sources asserting the harmlessness of cannabis, and recommended a five-point plan: The government should permit and encourage research into all aspects of cannabis use, including its medical applications. Allowing the smoking of cannabis on private premises should no longer constitute an offence. Cannabis should be taken off the dangerous drugs list and controlled, rather than prohibited, by a new ad hoc instrument. Possession of cannabis should either be legally permitted or at most be considered a misdemeanour, punishable by a fine of not more than \u00a310 for a first offence and not more than \u00a325 for any subsequent offence. All persons now imprisoned for possession of cannabis or for allowing cannabis to be smoked on private premises should have their sentences commuted. The sixty-five signatories comprised leading names in British society, including Nobel Laureate Francis Crick, novelist Graham Greene, Members of Parliament Tom Driberg and Brian Walden, photographer David Bailey, directors Peter Brook and Jonathan Miller, broadcaster David Dimbleby, psychiatrists R. D. Laing, David Cooper, and David Stafford-Clark, the critic Kenneth Tynan, scientist Francis Huxley, activist Tariq Ali, and The Beatles, along with their manager Brian Epstein. The advertisement was controversial, receiving both public support and establishment condemnation. It was discussed in Parliament. At the 1967 Tory party conference, the Shadow Home Secretary, Quintin Hogg said he was \"profoundly shocked by the irresponsibility of those who wanted to change the law\", describing their arguments as \"casuistic, confused, sophistical and immature. \" The Wootton Committee's Report, when submitted in November 1968, specifically cited the advertisement's influence on its proceedings, noting that the advertisement's claim that \"the long-asserted dangers of cannabis are exaggerated and that the related law is socially damaging, if not unworkable', had caused the committee to \"give greater attention to the legal aspects of the problem\" and \"give first priority to presenting our views on cannabis. \" The Report vindicated much of the advertisement's position, stating \"the long-term consumption of cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful effects. \", that cannabis was \"no more dangerous than alcohol\" and that prison only be recommended for cases of \"organised large-scale trafficking\" and all other offenders be given, at the worst, suspended sentences. The Home Secretary of the day, James Callaghan denounced the Report, claiming its authors had been \"overinfluenced\" by the \"lobby\" responsible for \"that notorious advertisement. \" However he later quietly reversed his position, and many of the Report's recommendations became law in 1971 - ironically enacted by Hogg who, after a change of government, had taken over as Home Secretary. SOMA was an informal organization when the advertisement appeared. Later, it was incorporated as the Soma Research Association, Ltd. Apart from Abrams, directors included Francis Crick, four psychiatrists: Professor Norman Zinberg of Harvard, Dr. Anthony Storr, Dr. R. D. Laing, and Dr. David Cooper. Other directors were The Revd. Kenneth Leech, of the Church of England; and anthropologist Francis Huxley. SOMA had five employees, and premises in Fulham and Camden. SOMA had active research and medical programs, the latter in collaboration with the doctors at an affiliated NHS surgery in Notting Hill. Dr. Ian Dunbar was Medical Director of Soma and Dr. Sam Hutt was Medical Correspondent. Research efforts included compiling a bibliography of cannabis, and the first human experiments with the active principle of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), synthesized in their laboratory. They compared the action of the isomers of THC and tried to distinguish euphoria from intoxication by measuring the apparent tridimensionality of visual perception, the extent to which the world appeared, as it were, \"spaced-out. \" These activities attracted the attention of the News of the World, which printed a sensationalist expos\u00e9 on the front page of its July 7, 1968 issue with the headline \"This dangerous man MUST be stopped!\" next to a photograph of Abrams laughing. The caption quotes him as saying \"My own view, which goes beyond what many members of SOMA want, is for cannabis to eventually replace tobacco. \" Abrams shuttered SOMA in 1970. In 1987 Abrams appeared in the video for the song 'The Body' by Public Image Limited. Abrams died of emphysema after a lengthy illness. In his last days, against his doctor's wishes, he eschewed oxygen for doses of vaporised cannabis tincture, which he felt showed promising benefits. He died on 21 November 2012. There was no funeral. Abrams was remembered at the 'Abrams Picnic,' an outdoor event in the grounds of Greenwich University, London, during Breaking Convention - the 2nd Multidisciplinary Conference on Psychedelic Consciousness, on Sunday 14 July 2013.

Aburish was born in al-Eizariya (also known as \"Bethany\") in 1935, and he and his family moved to Beirut in 1948 upon the creation of the state of Israel. Aburish attended school in Jerusalem and Beirut. He returned to Beirut in the 1950s as a reporter for Radio Free Europe and the London Daily Mail. He returned to al-Eizariya in 2009, passing away there in 2012. Over the years, Aburish has written extensively about the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and his works on the subject include Cry Palestine, Children of Bethany and The Forgotten Faithful: The Christians of the Holy Land. Aburish has written a trio of biographies regarding three of the most prominent Arab presidents, Nasser: The Last Arab, Arafat: From Defender to Dictator and Saddam Hussein: The Politics of Revenge. Aburish has also been a strong critic of the Saudi royal family, most notably in the book The Rise, Corruption and Coming Fall of the House of Saud. Aburish garnered both praise and criticism for his style, with critics accusing him of \"hyperbole. \" Aburish considered his work \"revisionist history\"; according to Douglas Martin of The New York Times, however, Aburish \"reported facts and interpretations that were essentially truisms in the Arab world\"\u2014but \"novel to Western readers. \" In The Guardian, Andrew Lycett wrote that Aburish \"did much to illuminate the relationship between the Middle East and the west. \" Reviewing Aburish's A Brutal Friendship for Commentary, Daniel Pipes remarked that Aburish's analysis of Arab society was \"brief and superficial,\" arguing that Aburish's primary goal was to attribute the problems of the Arab world \"to a vast British and American conspiracy. \" Despite this, Pipes concluded \"outlandish as it may be, the book represents a main line of Arab thinking\" and therefore \"cannot be so easily dismissed. \" By contrast, Kathy Evans praised A Brutal Friendship in The Observer: \"For several decades now, [Aburish] has been making Arab governments wince with pain and embarrassment. Why? Because among Arab authors, he is almost alone in speaking the truth. \" In a favorable review, Publishers Weekly opined that while some of the material in Aburish's Saddam Hussein was \"controversial,\" Aburish's account was \"detailed, balanced,\" and \"credible\" given \"Aburish's extensive contacts in the Arab world. \" Publishers Weekly called Aburish's prose \"appropriately dramatic but not sensational. \" Elie Podeh, reviewing Aburish's Nasser for the International Journal of Middle East Studies, criticized Aburish for \"factual mistakes\" and \"misuse of sources,\" stating that \"Aburish has ignored new sources . . . based on declassified archival material\" in favor of \"outdated studies as well as several biased interviews, which he accepts at face value. \" While acknowledging that Nasser \"may be a good introduction to readers unfamiliar with the subject,\" Podeh commented \"serious students . . . will have to wait for another biography. \" Aburish, Said K. : Children of Bethany: The Story of a Palestinian Family, Indiana University Press 1988.

Achterberg was originally influenced by her collaboration with O. Carl Simonton, a specialist in radiology and oncology, and a pioneer of psycho-oncology. Simonton worked with cancer patients to develop strategies by which they could reduce the stress and distress precipitated by diagnosis and treatment, and enhance the capacity to perceive therapeutic interventions, including radiotherapy, as a progressive process toward a successful outcome. Among Simonton's methods was the use of creative visualization, guided imagery and guided meditation; and he observed an alleged correlation between patients' positive images of and thoughts about treatment, and its successful course and outcome. Influenced by her early collaboration with Simonton, Achterberg subsequently researched the similarities and differences between the potential use of imagery as an intervention adjuvant to contemporary medicine, and its use in ancient indigenous healing rituals, particularly those she identified as part of a shamanic tradition, which she described in her book Imagery in Healing.

Acosta was also accused of 143\u2013500 disappearances during Mexico's \"Dirty War\" in the 1970s. Acosta Chaparro, son of the Mexican Army general Francisco Acosta Chaparro, was \"one of the most controversial military men in Mexico's modern history. \" He was also one of the most \"ferocious\" persecutors of guerrilla groups during the presidencies of Luis Echeverr\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo. In the year 2000, Acosta was accused for allegedly having ties with the drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes of the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel. According to El Universal, Acosta and another Army general, Francisco Quir\u00f3s Hermosillo, were accused for having ties with Carrillo Fuentes, who allegedly gave large sums of money and gifts to the two generals for protection. All of this information was attained after a protected witness, Gustavo Tar\u00edn Ch\u00e1vez\u2014who was even sent to the United States to be interrogated\u2014declared against several members of the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel, naming Acosta and Quir\u00f3s along with them.

Tar\u00edn Ch\u00e1vez's court testimonyTar\u00edn Ch\u00e1vez's testimony was read aloud through a microphone in court on the first days of November 2002. According to his declarations, one day Acosta Chaparro answered a phone call and heard the voice from the other line say: \"Son! How are you? Son!\" Tar\u00edn Ch\u00e1vez said that they only person that called him that was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, also known as El Se\u00f1or de los Cielos (Lord of the Skies), the leader of the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel. During the phone call, Carrillo Fuentes reportedly told Acosta that he had spoken with Rub\u00e9n Figueroa Alcocer, the former governor of Guerrero, and that \"everything was settled. \" Acosta Chaparro was given the orders to pick up over fifty AK-47s assault rifles, thirty pistols, twenty two-way radios, ten cartridges and a SUV from the drug lord and hand them over to the governor. There were declarations that Acosta planned the arrival of Colombian aircraft loaded with narcotics. Acosta's logistic work allegedly involved the delivery of cars, money, and communication accessories to military officers who worked for Carrillo Fuentes. The regional military commanders of Sinaloa, Durango, and Chihuahua were also accused of being on the payroll of the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel. In the year 2002, Acosta was accused of homicide after the disappearances of leftist activists and revolutionaries during Mexico's Dirty War between the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and left-wing student and guerrilla groups in the 1960s and 1970s, largely under the presidencies of Luis Echeverr\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo. A judge declared that Acosta was not responsible for the disappearances and dismissed the charges. El Informador newspaper reported that Acosta was accused in 2002 for the death of 22 peasants in the 1970s, but that the charges were dropped in February 2006 after there were no juridical elements to keep him in prison. In 1968, Acosta Chaparro was part of the Batall\u00f3n Olimpia, a military-led agency that was organized to suppress the student uprisings; in the 1970s, he was promoted to the rank of colonel and was entitled to form part of a counterinsurgency group. According to the newspaper La Cr\u00f3nica de Hoy, there is a legend that Acosta Chaparro liberated senator Rub\u00e9n Figueroa Figueroa from the Guerrero-based guerrilla group that was led by Lucio Caba\u00f1as in 1974. Acosta was also in charge of a prison in Guerrero, where he reportedly tortured inmates who were involved in the guerrilla campaign. All of them were later released during the presidency of Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo, after he granted them amnesty. On 30 June 2007, La Jornada newspaper published an article of an incident where ex-guerrilla members and their families complained about Acosta's release from jail and condemned the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n for doing so. In addition, Andr\u00e9s N\u00e1jera, the president of the Eureka Committee in the state of Guerrero, linked Acosta to 30% of the disappearances during the \"dirty war\" in the 1970s. He said: \"Out of the 600 that are currently disappeared, more than 200 of them had to do with general Acosta. \" The activists then said that Acosta was one of the most \"ruthless\" criminals in the country, because he allegedly persecuted Eloy Cisneros Guill\u00e9n and Octaviano Santiago Dionisio, former members of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and social activists. In addition, Aurora Mu\u00f1oz Mart\u00ednez, the secretary of the Human Rights State Executive Committee (Spanish: Derechos Humanos del Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo Estatal, CEE) of the PRD, said that she lamented the liberation of Acosta and recognized that no evidence was found against him; nonetheless, she said that Acosta's participation in the \"dirty war\" left hundreds disappeared. Proceso magazine reported on 20 April 2012 that Acosta was allegedly involved in torture and flying airplanes and throwing the bodies of guerrilla members at the ocean. Francisco Quir\u00f3s Hermosillo, who was accused of drug trafficking with Acosta, was believed to be involved in the disappearances too. International organizations like Amnesty International blamed Acosta Chaparro for the disappearances of the opposition groups of the government of that time. During the 1970s, Acosta was in charge of the counterinsurgency operations in the state of Guerrero. Witness' testimonyOn 7 November 2002, El Universal published an article with the confessions of Margarito Monroy Candia, a former mechanic at a military base in Pie de la Cuesta, Guerrero, who declared that Mario Acosta and Humberto Quir\u00f3s would kill people extrajudicially. In fact, Monroy was the mechanic of the airplane that Acosta allegedly flew to throw the bodies of the activists and guerrilla members in the ocean. According to the testimonies, military officers would make two or three plane \"trips\" a day, where they would throw the bodies in the ocean; the bodies were reportedly placed in sack bags and filled with rocks before being thrown. One of the pilots who was to serve as a witness is now dead\u2014allegedly shot for confessing against Acosta's supposed involvement in drug trafficking. Monroy Candia is now a retired military officer; he is approximately 60 years old. When a number of Mexican soldiers appeared at his door on his home in a Mexico City neighborhood, Monroy did not want to speak. Nonetheless, he later accepted to do so and reportedly \"spoke for more than 12 hours\" on what he had seen in the \"Dirty War. \" During the presidential administration of Ernesto Zedillo, 17 peasants were killed on 28 June 1995 in the village of Aguas Blancas, Guerrero. According to the villagers, they had led a march of over 40 people, asking the government for \"fertilizers\" and a better lifestyle; then, 17 members of the march were ambushed and gunned down by police officers. 23 others were found injured. Acosta Chaparro was allegedly involved in this massacre. A letter written by the incarcerated drug baron Edgar Valdez Villarreal, alias \"La Barbie,\" was published in the Reforma newspaper on November 28, 2012, after being shown to the journalist Anabel Hernandez. In the letter, which alleges systematic corruption among all levels of Mexico's police forces, Valdez claims that General Acosta Chaparro was sent on a mission in 2009 by President Felipe Calderon's government to persuade Mexico's various rival drug cartels\u2014the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas, La Familia Michoacana, the Beltran-Leyvas, La Barbie, and the Juarez Cartel\u2014to agree to a peace treaty. According to Valdez, Acosta Chaparro visited the leaders of all of these groups. Hernandez had interviewed the General two years earlier with the condition of anonymity, and he told her the same story. On 19 May 2010, in Mexico City's La Roma neighborhood, Acosta was injured after being shot four times in the thorax. During the attack, Acosta wrestled with the aggressor, while Rodolfo Chumacero Galindo\u2014a former military officer and friend of Acosta\u2014searched for the gun Acosta \"always hid\" under the seat. According to police reports, the general and his chauffeur where inside a vehicle when a gunman who reportedly wanted to steal Acosta's wristwatch shot him multiple times. Acosta was on the wheel when the aggressor assaulted him, and shot him four times while Acosta accelerated. Acosta was reportedly inside his Mercedes Benz near his home at early hours in the morning when incident occurred. Later investigations mentioned that this assault was probably due to the Rolex Acosta had on him; nonetheless, the authorities did not discard other motives. The Mexico City police carried out an operation in the area to find the gunman; they were able to detain Joel Figueroa Cortez, a man with similar characteristics to those provided by the witnesses of the armed assault. He was later released after there were no elements that linked him to the assault. The attorney general of Mexico City informed on 20 May 2010 that the gunman that attempted to kill Acosta was under the age of 30, and that he acted on his own. Following the day of the shooting, the authorities were not able to produce a portrait of the criminal to facilitate his capture. A woman and friend of Acosta, Minerva Vanesa Karim Demichelis, was able to describe what the gunman was wearing, but claimed that she was \"not able to see [the criminal's] face. \" Rodolfo Chumacero Galindo, a friend of Acosta, was outside of the vehicle was not aware of the confrontation until he saw Acosta injured. For more than two years following the attacks, the investigations of this incident were never publicized. The reasons for the attacks were never clarified, although Acosta's ties with Mexican drug cartels or an assassination attempt done by guerrilla groups have not been discarded. On 20 April 2012 at An\u00e1huac neighborhood in Mexico City, a witness told the authorities that Acosta had arrived at an auto shop to drop off his car when a lone gunman approached him and shot him three times in the head. The assailant used a 9 mm handgun and then ran away to a motocycle where an accomplice was awaiting for him. The two of them then drove away. According to reports, Acosta was standing nearby a Ford Explorer and talking with two people at around 18:00 in An\u00e1huac neighborhood right before he was shot. Medical help arrived 9 minutes after he was wounded. When the paramedics arrived, they indicated that Acosta was alive despite having visible shots in the head and thorax. They gave him first aid care and took him on the ambulance. Acosta was identified by the ID he carried. Acosta, however, died on his way to the Red Cross Central Hospital in the Polanco neighborhood. Soon after the shootout, the Federal Police and the SSP guarded the area. The Secretariat of National Defense (Sedena) said that Acosta was simply picking up his vehicle, but it refused to give more information because Acosta was already retired at the time of the incident. Acosta Chaparro had served for more than 45 years in the Mexican Army. Two hours after the death of Acosta Chaparro, the Red Cross officially informed through a communiqu\u00e9 that he had died. The attorney general of Mexico City, Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Almeida, reported on 20 April 2012 that Acosta Chaparro's death was a \"direct aggression\" apparently by someone who had followed him all the way to the auto shop. He discarded that Acosta's assassination was simply an armed robbery. According to the authorities, when Acosta was speaking with two people, the killer\u2014a short-size man of approximately 25 years of age, who was wearing jeans and a white-colored shirt at the moment of execution\u2014got close. He then walked past Acosta, turned around and looked at him, and then returned while pulling out a 9 mm pistol, shooting him at close distance as he conversed with a person. There were only three known witnesses during Acosta's execution. 3 bullet casings were found on the scene. The security videocameras of the SSP contain the exact footage when general Acosta was gunned down. The video was finally posted and released on YouTube by several media outlets on 3 June 2012. The body was taken to the medical examiner's office at night on 20 April 2012 to determine Acosta's cause of death. After the end of the autopsy at the Servicio M\u00e9dico Forense (SEMEFO), the corpse of Acosta Chaparro was handed over to his family members early in the morning on 21 April 2012. The family members asked the media and authorities to not release the location the funeral home where Acosta will be taken. On 4 June 2012, a man allegedly named Jonathan Javier Arechega Zaraz\u00faa was detained in connection with the assassination of Acosta Chaparro. The supposed suspected was detained after an anonymous call alerted the police of a man with similar features to the facial composite created by the Mexican authorities with the help of several eyewitnesses in the assassination. In a press conference, the Attorney General of Mexico City stated that there are several witnesses that recognize the 22-year-old Arechega Zaraz\u00faa as the assassin. Nonetheless, the detainee has a clean record and declared himself innocent, but will remain under custody for 30 days. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in January 2013. Acosta Chaparro's grandson, Horacio Barqu\u00edn Cevallos, was killed in his house on 28 April 2012 in Taxco, Guerrero. He was serving as a substitute deputy for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) after Manuel Saidi Prats renounced his party and went over to the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). According to government reports, heavily armed men interrupted his house in Taxco at around 17:40 hours, shooting Barqu\u00edn Cevallos to death.

At the Hall Institute he initially worked on the viruses that cause influenza and Murray Valley encephalitis. He was the first to establish that influenza is an RNA virus and was awarded his DSc by the University of Sydney in 1959. From 1962 he focused on immune reactions, demonstrating that antigens are not present in antibody-producing cells, in support of Burnet's clonal selection theory. In 1968 Ada was appointed head of the Microbiology Department at the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University, taking over from Frank Fenner. He held the position for 20 years; during his period of leadership the school became an international centre for the analysis of T cell-mediated immunity.

Charlie Arehart, pastor of MCC of the Rockies in Denver and Frank Zerilli, Rev. Troy Perry's long-time assistant. In 1975, the couple applied with the Immigration and Naturalization Service for Sullivan to be granted permanent residency as a citizen's spouse. The petition was initially denied, with a letter stating that \"[Adams and Sullivan] have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots. \" A revised letter was later sent after they filed a formal protest, explaining that \"[a] marriage between two males is invalid for immigration purposes and cannot be considered a bona fide marital relationship since neither party to the marriage can perform the female functions in marriage. \"They sued the INS in 1979, but a federal district judge upheld the INS decision. They also lost their appeals. They later filed a second suit arguing that Sullivan's deportation after the couple had been together for 8 years constituted an \"extreme hardship. \" The U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected their claims, making it possible for Sullivan to be deported. Following that loss, they traveled in Europe for a year, but they eventually returned to the US and stopped doing high-profile activism to avoid attention from immigration authorities. Adams worked as an administrator for a law firm until his retirement in 2010. After retirement, Adams and Sullivan made some appearances at events supporting gay marriage. They are featured in the documentary Limited Partnership, which was released by Tesseract Films in 2014. Adams died of cancer in Los Angeles in December 2012. On April 21, 2014, on their 39th wedding anniversary, Sullivan filed a motion with the Los Angeles Field Office of U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to reopen and reconsider Adams' petition for a marriage-based green card. On January 5, 2014, the USCIS approved Adams' immigrant visa petition filed in 1975 on behalf of his husband. Sullivan received his green card in April 21, 2016.

He was a Liberal member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1964 to 1972, representing the seat of Denison. Tasmania's first Minister for Road Safety, he resigned from the Liberal Party to stand as an independent after failing to get his road safety measures approved by the party. Abbott was born in the town of Clunes, near Ballarat in Victoria. He moved to Tasmania with his family when his father, a doctor, started a medical practice in the Huon Valley. He was educated at a public high school in Geeveston, then at the Anglican private school Hutchins in Hobart, and completing his secondary education at St Peter's College, Adelaide in 1937. Following his father into a medical career, Abbott studied the first year of a medical degree at the University of Tasmania before moving to the University of Adelaide in South Australia, from where he graduated MBBS in 1944. During his studies, he played six games of Australian rules football for South Adelaide in the SANFL. In January 1942 in Adelaide, Abbott enlisted in the Australian Army and served as a Private in the 6th Cavalry Ambulance unit. In July 1945 in Brighton, Tasmania, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and saw service with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in post-war Japan. Upon his discharge with the rank of Captain in July 1948, he joined the Citizen Military Forces and was commanding officer of the 10th Field Ambulance. As a Lieutenant Colonel, Abbott served for three months in 1968 as head of a military aid mission during the Vietnam War. He implemented a new malaria prophylaxis regimen, which was later adopted across all Australian and American forces in Vietnam. Following his military service, Abbott returned to Tasmania where he resumed his medical career, working as a consulting physician at the Royal Hobart Hospital and later Queenstown Hospital. He then worked as a general practitioner at Zeehan before returning to Hobart to operate a GP practice at Kingston. Abbott entered politics at a local government level, serving as an alderman on the Hobart City Council from 1962 to 1964. At the Tasmanian state election in 1964, Abbott was elected as a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, representing the electorate of Denison for the Liberal Party. When the Liberal Party led by Angus Bethune formed an alliance with Kevin Lyons' Centre Party in 1969, the Labor government of Eric Reece lost its majority in the House of Assembly, and Bethune became Premier of Tasmania. Abbott was appointed to Bethune's cabinet, serving as Minister for Health and taking on a new portfolio of Road Safety. On 27 September 1971, Abbott announced he had resigned as road safety minister after the Tasmanian Legislative Council voted down what he saw as vital legislation on road safety, introducing on-the-spot fines for traffic offences and a demerit point system. He had previously promised to resign if he could not successfully lower the state's road toll, which by September had already exceeded the number of road deaths in 1970. Bethune's cabinet met the next day, and after a two-and-a-half hour meeting, convinced Abbott to withdraw his resignation and return to work. Five months later, the Liberal\u2013Centre coalition collapsed when Lyons resigned as Deputy Premier and withdrew his support for the Liberals, triggering the 1972 election. In the week after Lyons' resignation, Abbott also resigned as a minister after not getting the assurance of support he sought from the party for his road safety reforms. Abbott's portfolios were assigned to the state attorney-general Max Bingham until the election. Abbott announced he would not contest the 1972 election, but ended up contesting Denison as an ungrouped independent candidate, however he was not elected. He returned to local government in 1988, serving as an alderman on Kingborough Council until 1996. In the Queen's Birthday Honours in 1994, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for service to the community, particularly through local government and to the Tasmanian Parliament. Abbott's father, also named Dr Nigel Abbott, was a medical doctor who was involved with the conservative Nationalist Party (a precursor to the Liberal Party)\u2014Abbott senior was an endorsed Nationalist candidate for the seat of Franklin at the 1934 Tasmanian state election, but failed to nominate by the deadline. On 27 August 1948, Abbott married Jocelyn Ruth Butler at South Yarra, Melbourne. They had six children: Tony, Deb, Clive, Geoff, Rick and Felicity. Felicity was killed in a road accident in 1952, which inspired Abbott's commitment to road safety as a campaigner and later as a government minister.

Abbott was born in Birkenhead, England; at age 7, he and his family moved to Montreal. While attending Loyola High School, he met Don Ferguson, who would become a co-star of Royal Canadian Air Farce. After graduation in 1963, he attended Loyola College (now Concordia University). Abbott began his career in behind-the-scene jobs in radio. In 1970, comedians John Morgan and Martin Bronstein, who were looking for non-actors who could write and perform their own material, convinced Abbott to join the cast of an improvisational theatre revue called The Jest Society (a pun on then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's famous goal of making Canada a \"Just Society\"). After a number of personnel changes, the troupe \u2014 now consisting of Abbott, Morgan, Bronstein, Don Ferguson, Luba Goy and Dave Broadfoot\u2014 became known as the Royal Canadian Air Farce. On December 9, 1973, they began a weekly broadcast on CBC radio in front of a live audience at the CBC's Parliament Street studio in Toronto. Abbott quickly showed his organizational abilities \u2014 Don Ferguson called him \"the guiding light of Royal Canadian Air Farce\" and \"a combination of artistic, organizational and business talent\". Abbott also became the \"warm-up man\" for the weekly broadcasts, chatting to the audience before introducing the rest of the cast. Abbott said the greatest influences on his style of comedy were Dave Broadfoot and the British comedy troupe Monty Python. Bronstein left the troupe the following year -- the remaining members would be the ongoing cast of Royal Canadian Air Farce for many years. Air Farce branched into television in 1980 with a 10-week series of television shows for CBC, although they continued to produce their weekly radio show. About the same time, the producers of the American sitcom Taxi offered Abbott and Ferguson a chance to be writers on the show, but they turned the offer down. In 1989, Abbott directed Huge Jumbo Comedy Thing, a show starring a troupe called the Maroons that CHOM-FM described as \"Canada's answer to Monty Python\". For many years, Abbott and Don Ferguson co-hosted the annual televised Easter Seals Telethon. In 1992, Royal Canadian Air Farce returned to television, this time as a weekly series, although the weekly radio series also continued to be produced until 1997. Abbott became well known for many roles on the television show, including parodies of Jean Chr\u00e9tien, The Queen Mother, Yasser Arafat, Leonard Cohen, George W. Bush, Brian Williams, Peter Mansbridge, Don Newman, Craig Oliver, and \"Native Persons Spokesman\" Billy Two-Willies. The title of the television show changed several times, first shortened to Air Farce, then to Air Farce Live, and in its final season (2008\u20132009), Air Farce Live\u2014The Final Flight. Air Farce continued to produce occasional specials for CBC, and Abbott's last appearance on Air Farce was their New Year's Eve special that aired on December 31, 2010. Abbott was diagnosed with the progressive disease chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 1997, but only shared this fact with family and close friends. After a 14-year battle, he succumbed to leukemia on March 26, 2011 at Toronto General Hospital at the age of 64. A video tribute to Abbott from his friends and colleagues at Royal Canadian Air Farce was posted on YouTube on March 27, 2011. An hour-long tribute to Abbott, featuring many of his memorable sketches, aired on CBC Television on March 29, 2011. A memorial service entitled \"Roger's Wrap Party\" was held in Toronto on April 11, 2011. Speakers included Jessica Holmes, Dave Broadfoot, Vicki Gabereau, Luba Goy, and Don Ferguson. The Air Farce New Years Day special was dedicated to the memory of Roger Abbott. A small segment was shown with the donut foursome sitting at the table with the also late John Morgan.

A veterinarian by profession, he held various positions in the government of Cameroon from 1970 to 1983, ultimately serving as Minister of State for the Armed Forces. Later, he was the Government Delegate to the Urban Commune of Garoua from 1996 to 2009, and in 2009 he was appointed as Roving Ambassador. Maikano was born in Gaschiga, located in the Garoua arrondissement of Benoue Department. He received his primary education at Garoua's regional school and attended secondary school at Bongor in Chad from 1947 to 1948. As a Muslim, he learned to recite the Koran as a child, although he did so without any knowledge of Arabic. He was included in the first group of students from northern Cameroon to be sent to France in 1950; the group was sent by Ahmadou Ahidjo, who was a delegate in the Representative Assembly of Cameroon. After completing veterinary studies in France, he returned to Cameroon in July 1964; by that point Cameroon had obtained its independence, with Ahidjo as its President. From 27 July 1964 to January 1966, Maikano was deputy head of the northern sector of animal husbandry at Maroua. He was appointed as Director of Animal Husbandry and Animal Industries at East Cameroon's Secretariat of State for Animal Husbandry in 1966. Maikano was first appointed to the government of Cameroon as Minister of the Civil Service on 12 June 1970. He was instead appointed as Minister of Planning and Urban and Regional Planning (Am\u00e9nagement du territoire) on 3 July 1972, and then as Minister of Animal Husbandry and Animal Industries on 30 June 1975. Three years later, on 2 May 1978, he was moved back to his former post as Minister of the Civil Service. His name was officially changed from Abdoulaye Maikano to Maikano Abdoulaye on 9 March 1979. He was appointed as Minister of the Armed Forces on 17 July 1980, and he was promoted to the rank of Minister of State on 7 January 1982, while retaining the armed forces portfolio. He was Acting Prime Minister for a time in 1982. Maikano was viewed as a loyalist of Ahidjo, who was President until resigning on 4 November 1982; after he resigned, Ahidjo was succeeded by Prime Minister Paul Biya. According to Maikano, he was not informed of Ahidjo's resignation in advance and learned of it along with the rest of the country; he also said that Ahidjo called him and other members of the northern elite into a meeting and asked them to \"work with [Biya] as you have with me\". Maikano initially retained his post as Minister of State for the Armed Forces under President Biya, but a political feud soon developed between Ahidjo and Biya. Biya dismissed some Ahidjo loyalists from the government on 18 June 1983, although Maikano still kept his post; Ahidjo reacted angrily to the changes and called the ministers from northern Cameroon to a meeting at his home later on the same day. At that meeting, he told the northern ministers that they should resign from the government, hoping that by doing so they would undermine Biya. Maikano also held a meeting in Yaound\u00e9 at the home of Ibrahim Wadjiri, the Delegate-General of the Gendarmerie, at which he explained Ahidjo's plan to top military officers from the north, while also telling the officers that they should stay out of the situation due to its political nature. Ahidjo did not go forward with his plan, however, and he went into exile on 19 July 1983. A month later, on 22 August 1983, Biya publicly accused Ahidjo of plotting a coup d'\u00e9tat; on the same occasion, he dismissed Maikano and another Ahidjo loyalist, Prime Minister Bello Bouba Maigari, from the government. Gilbert Andze Tsoungui was appointed to replace Maikano. When dismissing Maikano and Bello Bouba, Biya did not explicitly accuse them of involvement in the coup plot, but the timing of their dismissal nevertheless implied that they were suspected of involvement. Ahidjo was tried in absentia for the 1983 coup plot and was sentenced to death by a tribunal on 28 February 1984; on that occasion, the tribunal proposed that Maikano and Bello Bouba should also be placed on trial. However, Biya halted the legal proceedings against them. Although Maikano was suspected of involvement in the April 1984 coup attempt, which failed after heavy fighting in Yaound\u00e9, he was subsequently appointed as Director of the National Veterinary Laboratory (LANAVET), located near Garoua, on 14 September 1985. Maikano retired on 31 December 1993, but Biya called him out of retirement to serve as Government Delegate to the Urban Commune of Garoua in 1996. Biya appointed Maikano to that post following the victory of the opposition National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP) in Garoua's municipal election; the atmosphere in the city was tense and Maikano, as the representative of the government, was greeted with hostility from the UNDP. According to Maikano, however, he was not interested in confrontation and intended only to improve the situation in Garoua through dialogue and his experience. During his tenure as Government Delegate, Maikano said that he remained on good terms with President Biya, although they rarely met. He credited Biya with helping him when he went to France for medical treatment. In his capacity as Government Delegate, Maikano was present for the inauguration of the American Corner at the Garoua Municipal Library on 13 December 2006 and expressed gratitude for the donation of materials and resources by the United States Embassy. Maikano remained in his post as Government Delegate until a successor took office on 1 March 2009; on that occasion, he was praised and credited with restoring calm to the city.

He was appointed to this position (vacant since the death of Shamil Basayev) on 19 March 2007, by the President of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Dokka Umarov. He was considered the most senior figure after Umarov in the ranks of the Caucasian Emirate and a possible successor. Abdullayev was commander of the Jundullah Brigade, linked to the Vedeno-based wing of the Chechen resistance movement which was close to Basayev. He was primarily a religious figure rather than a military man, alike Abdul-Halim Sadulayev. Abdullayev was born in the Kazakh SSR. He was a member of the Chechen teip of Tsadakharoy. In the late 1980s, together with the Chechen Islamist leader, Movladi Udugov, he was a founder member of the Islamic Renaissance Party, established in the Soviet Union. After the First Chechen War, Supyan Abdullayev held the rank of Colonel and the deputy of Islam Khalimov, following Khalimov's appointment to the post of the interior minister in 1997. Both of the men left the ministry following the gun battle in Gudermes between the Salafis and the supporters of then-president Aslan Maskhadov on 15 July 1998. In the aftermath, Abdullayev grew distant from politics and became known as a \"second stringer. \" During the Second Chechen War, Abdullayev entered the ranks of the resistance in the very beginning, started out as a leader of a jamaat and eventually became the commander of a front and member of the Maskhadov government, reaching the rank of Brigadier General. Even though he was a jamaat member, he remained loyal to Aslan Maskhadov until the death of the latter. Supyan Abdullayev developed into one of the most senior ranking field commanders of the Caucasus Emirate, and the chief ideologue of the whole movement. He was named as Dokka Umarov's deputy emir. On 28 March 2011, Abdullayev was killed in a Russian airstrike on a rebel camp in Ingushetia.

Born in Takatsuki, Osaka, Seiseki Abe was introduced to the art of calligraphy by his father in 1934 and became a shodo teacher in 1948, teaching in his hometown of Osaka. Finding himself in a sort of spiritual crisis early in his calligraphy career, he started training in misogi under Kenzo Futaki, director of the Misogi no Renseikai (\"Misogi Training Society\"), who happened to be a former student of Morihei Ueshiba. Futaki advised him to learn aikido. Abe met Morihei Ueshiba at the inauguration of the aikido dojo of Bansen Tanaka in Osaka in 1952 and began training immediately. He was particularly struck by the similarity between the breathing technique used in aikido, misogi and shodo and arrived to the conclusion that the three arts are pursuing the same ultimate goal - the comprehension of the concept of ki. He studied aikido under Ueshiba for many years while perfecting his shodo technique. Ueshiba gradually took interest in calligraphy and one day asked Abe to teach him shodo (around 1954). A very special relationship developed between the two men and from 1959 until his death, Ueshiba would regularly come to stay at Abe's home in Osaka to learn calligraphy and teach aikido at the traditional dojo Abe built for him just next to his house (the Ameno Takemusu Juku Dojo). Abe was verbally awarded the grade of 10th dan by Ueshiba, although the Aikikai only recognized him as 8th dan. After the death of Ueshiba in 1969, Abe continued to teach both shodo and aikido at his dojo in Osaka. He had formed over 200 shodo shihan and had about 3000 students in the Kansai region as well as in the United States (New York, Los Angeles) and in Australia. He was an active member of the Nitten, the most important art organization in Japan. In aikido, one of his most notable former students is the movie actor and martial artist Steven Seagal.

During the 1949 VFL season he played reserves football with Hawthorn Football Club but turned his back on a possible career with the club in the seniors when he moved to Adelaide, South Australia. When Abley moved to Adelaide it initially looked like he would be playing for Glenelg (as his younger brother Kevin did) instead of Port as after the area he planned on residing in was part of Glenelg's recruiting zone. Port Adelaide officials, at the suggestion of Bob McLean, hastily arranged alternate accommodation in the hope of acquiring his services and Abley debuted for Port Adelaide in 1950. A fullback, Abley first played in that position for Port in a \"Challenge match\" in Broken Hill at the end of his debut season and after impressing was kept there for the remainder of his career. He was a member of the famed Port team which won six premierships in succession from 1954 to 1959, an Australian record.

He was governor of Giza from 2000 till 2004, and Kafr-El-Sheikh from 1996 till 2000. Abouelleil was born in the city of El-Minia, governorate of El-Minia on 24 December 1935 to a father engaged in journalism. He moved to Cairo in the early fifties and after completing his high school education at Al-Ibrahimiyya school, he enrolled in 1954 into the faculty of Law, Cairo University, graduating in 1958. He was appointed assistant to the public prosecutor and along the years ascended the career ladder to the become head of the Cairo Appeal's court and the Cairo and Giza Criminal and National Security court. He was subsequently appointed Chief Justice of the Giza Primary Court from 1992 till 1996. During his years as a governor Mahmoud Abouelleil was a keen supporter of projects to improve infrastructure and public services and the development of industrial areas, as well as encouragement of investment opportunities in Kafr-el-Sheikh and Giza. Also notable during this period, was shedding the spotlight on the Bahariya Oasis region. These efforts culminated in the presidential decision to allocate 20,000 feddan for agricultural, industrial and tourism development in accordance with environmental considerations in this promising area. Several important events occurred during Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil's years as minister of justice. Presidential elections took place for the first time in the history of Egypt. This occurred in the midst of several changes to the constitution and other fundamental political laws. In particular, the \"Judiciary Power Law\" which had been demanded by judges for over twenty years, finally saw the light in the form of several amendments in favour of judiciary independence. There was also a modification to the current law that deals with regulation of the media to provide new guarantees for freedom of speech and expression. This was law no. 47, 15 July 2006. Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil oversaw the parliamentary elections in 2005 by heading the electoral committee in which in the first stage the elections witnessed an unprecedented success of independent candidates. Before the elections Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil issued a statement in his capacity as head of the electoral committee guaranteeing that the judiciary observation of the elections would be comprehensive and impartial. This however was not allowed to occur in the second and third stages of the elections which resulted in a crisis forming between the judges group and the state. The judges made their demands clear in terms of independence of the judiciary from the state, and the guarantee of fair and impartial elections. Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil sided with the judges and in an historic publication from the ministry of justice he indicated his support of independent judiciary. This was published on June 8, 2005 and was sent to Egypt's highest judiciary board. During this time, the ministry continued to support the different judges groups across the country, providing subsidised health care and financial support to the groups in Cairo, Alexandria and surrounding districts. The crisis between the judges group and the state continued, and it cast its shadow over the two years during which Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil was in this position. The continuation of the crisis made it difficult for Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil to continue his other political and administrative duties. He presented his resignation while indicating his continued vision and support for judiciary independence, and while making clear that his vision is one that cannot be realised in the current climate. His resignation was accepted ten days after it was presented and was followed by the presidential decision to honour him with the Republican Medal of the First Degree, one of Egypt's highest state honours. Counsellor Abouelleil died on 27 September 2011. Mahmoud Abouelleil married Nadia Abdelaziz in 1968. They had three children and six grandchildren.

First recognized for his remarkable contribution at age 19 as senior artist with the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in New York City, he is among the most respected Washington DC artists of the past century. Abramowitz was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1917 to Russian immigrants. As a young child he craved the artistry of signs, posters and illustrations, and was enraptured by the art in museums. Walking hours to study life drawing at the Brooklyn Museum School, at 16 the Brooklyn Museum honored him with his first solo exhibition. He attended the National Academy of Design, absorbing the models of the avant-garde and social-realists, studying the masters. In 1936 he joined the Work Projects Administration (W. P. A. ) using the name of Ben Hoffman and moved through the ranks, as teacher, mural assistant, senior printmaker and painter. He was 19 years old. The Metropolitan Museum in New York holds eleven lithographs from the young artist. In 1941, with the world at war, Abramowitz moved to Washington, DC taking on U. S. government graphic assignments. He chose to make Greenbelt his base for both home and studio for more than half a century. The postwar years were a time of critical personal and artistic evolution for him. Two young children complicated his daily struggle for time and energy. By day a lithographer, each and every night driven by discipline, he drew and painted. By the time he was in his early 30s, Abramowitz had become a celebrated star in the growing Washington, DC-Baltimore regional art scene. From the 1940s on, critics, curators and collectors enthusiastically sought out his work. His work began to be purchased for major regional collections among them, the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Phillips Collection. The Corcoran Gallery of Art selected his work annually for its biennial exhibitions. By the mid-20th century, Abramowitz, was recognized not only as a painter, but also as a teacher and \"art coach\" throughout the Washington metropolitan area. Among his students was the D. C. painter and sculptor Lilian Thomas Burwell. The Ford Foundation singled him out and sent him throughout the country, lecturing, conducting seminars and critiques as artist-in-residence. All the while, he kept journals and maintained an active correspondence with critics, curators and students. By the 1970s, he moved beyond the canvas, and turned to making elegant and iconic wall works and freestanding sculptures, some black, some white, filling book after book with ideas for more. He designed four books illustrating the basic principles of the creative experience. Until his mid-80s, when diminishing vision essentially prevented him from continuing to work, he created steadily and with the same discipline and vigor that marked his earlier years. By 2008, his early work in the WPA became increasingly valuable and recognized, and is currently featured in a touring exhibition. Abramowitz' distinguished lifework has been cited in numerous prestigious biographical volumes. The National Archives of American Art holds hundreds of papers, letters and other materials. The modern art movement in the Washington region started mid-century, and the first was the work of Ben Abramowitz,\" said Walter Hopps, museum director and curator, at a memorial service for artist Gene Davis at the National Gallery of Art in 1985. The prolific and complex achievements of master artist Benjamin Abramowitz in painting, sculpture, works on paper in drawing and watercolor span almost eight decades. Noted for his compelling aesthetic vision, Abramowitz has been hailed by critics, curators and collectors as one of the most important artists of the 20th century.

Born in Jersey City, Abramson graduated from Columbia High School in nearby Maplewood. He earned a bachelor's degree from the Wharton School of Business, but his life took a different turn when he was accepted at the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, where he earned a master's degree in 1977. His thesis, \"Black Night Clubs of Chicago's South Side,\" was a reflection and analysis of the photographs he took of patrons and performers in multiple nightclubs on Chicago's south side during the mid-1970s. Abramson's images of night life have often been compared to the 1920s Paris photographer Brassa\u00ef (1899-1984). Abramson decided to stay in Chicago, where for two years following graduation he taught photography as a part-time instructor. He quickly realized that teaching was not his calling, but subsequently found satisfaction in freelance photographery. Throughout his long career, his assignments increasingly came from national news publications, such as Time, Forbes, Newsweek, Business Week, Fortune, & Bloomberg. Notable subjects included Steven Spielberg, Michael Jordan, Ron Howard, Oprah Winfrey, Donald Rumsfeld, Louis Farrakhan, Bill Clinton, and Steve Jobs. Today his commercial work is managed by Getty Images. Abramson had two brief marriages, both ending in divorce within two years. In 1999, he began dating DePaul Professor Midge Wilson, and the two continued their relationship until Abramson's death from cancer on March 21, 2011. Abramson stipulated in his will that Wilson preserve his vintage photographs and act to insure his legacy. Abramson's south side prints were first published by the Chicago-based music recording company Numero Group. Their 2 LP/photography book package was entitled Light on the South (2009), and included over 100 of Abramson's South side photographs, along with two LPs of blues songs specifically selected to reflect what was likely playing on the jukeboxes in the clubs where Michael worked. To promote the package, Numero Group produced a multimedia slideshow on YouTube (https://www. youtube. com/watch?reload=9&v=ZoKdiKz9yWY). This unique release, Light on the South Side, was nominated in 2010 for a Grammy in the category of Best Boxed Or Special Limited Edition Package. Light on the South Side was also a nominee for the English MOJO Awards. Light on the South Side was not the first time Abramson's work could be found in book form. Following graduation, he and former classmate and business partner, Kathleen Aguilar, were hired to take photos of the The Thorne Rooms, one of the most popular exhibits at the Art Institute of Chicago. The book, The Thorne Miniature Rooms of the Art Institute of Chicago was released in 1984, with a second edition in 2005. Several postmortem books showcasing Abramson's south side images followed, including the solo-artist publication Gotta Go Gotta Flow: Life, Love, and Lust From Chicago's South Side (2015), with accompanying slam poetry by acclaimed author Patricia Smith. Collected works A Lasting Vision: Photographs From the Institute of Design 1970-2001 (2015), and Chicago Classic Photographers (2017), featured Abramson's south side images, as well. A lesser known portfolio is Camera Night, so named for the semi-monthly events held during the 1970s at strip clubs during which amateur photographers would be invited in before evening shows began to take shots of the performers getting ready. Michael took a different tack by turning his lens on the gobsmacked photographers. These provocative images can be found in Men Looking at Women in the 70s, released by Hoxton Mini-Press in 2017. Since 2011, Abramson's South side images have been displayed at multiple galleries and museums, including the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago (2014), Fotographie Forum in Frankfurt, Germany (2017), Benhadj-Djilali Gallerie in Berlin (2018), MMX Gallery in London (2018), Blue Sky Gallery in Portland, Oregon (2018), Candela Unbound! Gallery in Richmond, Virginia (2018), and at The Rangefinder Gallery in Chicago (2019) Today Abramson's photographs are archived in permanent collections at the Smithsonian, Art Institute of Chicago, California Museum of Photography, Chicago History Museum, and the Milwaukee Art Museum.

Dr. Abrosimov was born in 1948 in the city of Kuibyshev (now Samara). In 1971, he graduated from the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics of State University of Gorky (now Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod). Dr. Abrosimov undertook graduate studies in the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics of Lomonosov Moscow State University under the supervision of Professor Boris Shabat. In 1984 he defended his Ph. D. dissertation \u201cComplex Differential Systems and the Tangential Cauchy\u2013Riemann Equations\u201d. Dr. Abrosimov was Associate Professor in the Theory of Functions Subdepartment in the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics and Invited Lecturer in the Advanced School of General and Applied Physics (the base department of the Institute of Applied Physics and the Institute for Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences). Beginning from his first works in 1971\u20133, Dr. Abrosimov studied overdetermined systems of partial differential equations where he successfully applied an original approach developed. A bright mathematical work in 1988 was devoted to an explicit procedure enabling one to decide whether two given smooth real hypersurfaces are locally CR-diffeomorphic. Subsequently, Dr. Abrosimov applied his original technique to describe CR-automorphisms of real quadrics of higher codimension. In this direction, he obtained important results and elaborated methods nowadays well known to CR-geometry specialists. First, Dr. Abrosimov proved that holomorphic automorphisms of a quadric of codimension two are furnished by birational transformations of degree two. Secondly, he convincingly demonstrated the power of the machinery of differential algebra in CR-geometry. In particular, he proved that under mild conditions the stabilizer of a point in the group of automorphisms of a quadric in Cn is a linear group. Thirdly, he was amongst the first researchers to look into scrutinizing a class of CR-manifolds of codimension one. To date, the class has remained a focus of active attention and efforts of research. Overall, Dr. Abrosimov published more than 25 scientific works on complex analysis. Some of the works of Dr. Abrosimov in CR-geometry and adjacent fields in complex analysis are deemed pioneering and his contribution important. 1. A. V. Abrosimov and L. G. Mikhailov (1971).

She became the first female cabinet minister in Egypt in 1962. Her tenure as minister of social affairs set a precedent. Afterwards, it became common for women to head that ministry. An avowed advocate of Nasserism, Abu Zayd has had a major impact on Egyptian law and policy in the areas of social affairs and insurance. Born in the village of Shaykh Daud, located near the city of al-Qusiyya in Asyut Governorate, Abu Zayd grew up in a nationalist household. Her father's job at the Egyptian State Railways meant that he was assigned to many stations and was constantly on the move. Although her mother was illiterate, Abu Zayd was encouraged to read and was given access to her father's large library. Abu Zayd received an advanced education. After completing her secondary education at the Helwan Girls School, she obtained a licence in history from Cairo University (then named Fuad I University) in 1940. She progressed further in her academic studies by receiving a teaching certificate in 1941, a Master of Arts in education in 1950 from the University of St Andrews, and finally a doctorate in educational psychology from the University of London in 1957. She taught in the Women's College of Ain Shams University from 1955 to 1964, before being promoted to the rank of professor at Cairo University in 1965. In 1962, Abu Zayd sat on the preparatory committee for the National Congress of Popular Forces. During her membership of the committee, she expressed her disagreement with President Gamal Abdel Nasser over some sections in the Charter of National Action. Impressed, Nasser decided to appoint her as a minister. On 29 September 1962, Abu Zayd was named minister of social affairs in Ali Sabri's first government. She retained her role when the cabinet was reshuffled in March 1964, and served until 1965. Abu Zayd was part of a new female leadership that shared the same lower middle class background of Nasser and his fellow Free Officers. Her appointment by Nasser was made in the context of his new socialist program, which put emphasis on broadening access to education and employment for all people, regardless of gender or social class. The 1950s and especially the 1960s were a time of increased female emancipation in Egypt. Polygyny was on the decline, and women were increasingly holding key posts in government, industry and academia. The country's first two female parliamentarians, Rawya Ateya and Amina Shukri, were elected in 1957. Karimah al-Sa'id became the deputy minister of education in the 1960s. Such high-level appointments of a few well-qualified women were showcased by the government, while the majority of Egyptian women remained stuck in the lower echelons of society. Nasser's appointment of Abu Zayd was a politically significant move. Including a woman in the cabinet was a way for him to co-opt female-run charitable organizations into the Arab Socialist Union (ASU), the country's newly formed sole political party. Many of these associations were headed by women from prominent families and were protective of their independence, which Nasser found objectionable. His regime targeted women's organizations in the early 1960s and moved to take over most of their functions as state responsibilities, thereby depriving the associations of their momentum and autonomy. Abu Zayd implemented these policies, which were aimed at benefiting female workers and peasants. The Ministry of Social Affairs which she headed was increasingly specializing in women's issues. In 1963, it organized a general and wide-ranging women's conference to discuss, among other things, ways to increase female economic productivity, working women's leading role in spreading family planning, as well as the rise of family income through the employment of female members. Abu Zayd was named to preside over the conference, thereby cementing her status as leader of the women's movement in Egypt. She became coordinator for women's activities within the Arab Socialist Union in 1963, at a time when the party had nearly 250,000 female members. During her time in office, Abu Zayd worked on several different social issues. She strongly supported a law that prohibited Islamic oral repudiation and made it mandatory for a husband to go to court to be able to divorce his wife. In order to combat mendicity, she imposed prison terms on recidivist beggars who returned to begging after they had received state-sponsored training in handicrafts. In addition to registering NGOs and expanding their development activities, she launched projects aimed at improving the status of rural women. One of the most sensitive tasks assigned to Abu Zayd was the relocation of thousands of Nubians, displaced by the construction of the Aswan Dam, to newly built villages. Her management of the resettlement process led to her being nicknamed the \"Merciful Heart of the Revolution\" by Nasser. Nevertheless, the Nubians' forced displacement remains controversial in Egypt to this day, with some blaming Nasser for the neglectful conditions in which the relocated Nubians have been living since then. On a personal level, Abu Zayd faced domestic problems during her tenure as minister. Her husband was resentful of her responsibility-laden role and of the amount of time she spent outside the house. Their previously modest lifestyle changed considerably as she hired a 12-year-old houseboy and was provided a chauffeur-driven car by the government. Following Nasser's death in 1970 and Anwar Sadat's ascension to the presidency, Abu Zayd's career progression was blocked. She moved to Libya with her husband in 1974. Her Nasserist convictions were in line with the anti-colonialism, anti-Zionism and pan-Arabism of Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi. Abu Zayd spent nearly two decades in Libya, during which time she taught political science at Al Fateh University in Tripoli. She also penned articles and made speeches denouncing the Egyptian government. Abu Zayd began criticizing President Sadat in the mid-1970s. She became a leader of the Egyptian National Front, which was set up in Damascus in 1980 by General Saad El Shazly. The organization called for the overthrow of Sadat's government. Due to her opposition to Sadat's peace overture to Israel, Abu Zayd was accused of high treason, terrorism and spying, and was consequently deprived of her Egyptian nationality. This turned her into a stateless political refugee. A long legal battle ensued, which was finally resolved in late 1991 when a judge ruled that Abu Zayd and her husband were entitled to their Egyptian passports. She was also acquitted of the charges of high treason and terrorism. After having recovered their nationality, Abu Zayd and her husband came back to Egypt in March 1992. She was treated as a VIP upon her return, and rushed to visit Nasser's mausoleum. During the 1990s, she opposed the Gulf War, the Madrid Peace Conference, as well as Israeli and American imperialism. She wrote articles for al-Osboa newspaper in 1998 dealing with the issues of Western imperialism and Arab unity. In late 2010, she was hospitalized at the Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo to receive treatment for her bone fractures. Farkhonda Hassan visited her there on behalf of then First Lady Suzanne Mubarak. During her stay at the hospital, Abu Zayd granted an interview to Almasry Alyoum newspaper in which she defended Nasser's legacy and lamented the loss of tolerance in Egypt. Abu Zayd died in Cairo on 30 July 2011. Abu Zayd received the Lenin Peace Prize in December 1970.

His primary areas of academic specialization were the Middle East and International Relations. He also had a special interest in the study and practice of interfaith dialogue between the Islamic and Christian religious traditions. Abu-Rabi\u2018 was born Nazareth and completed his schooling in Palestine. He attended university in the United States, earning a Master of Arts (MA) in Religious Studies from Temple University in 1983 and a MA in Political Science from the University of Cincinnati in 1982. He earned his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Islamic Studies, with concentrations in Modern Islamic Thought and Comparative Islamic Cultures, from the Temple University Department of Religion in 1987. His dissertation was entitled \"Islam and Search for Social Order in Modern Egypt: An Intellectual Biography of Shaykh al-Azhar 'Abd al-Halim Mahmud. \" Abu-Rabi\u2018 left Temple University and accepted temporary placements at Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Texas at Austin. In 1991 Abu-Rabi\u2018 accepted a post at the Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, serving as a professor for the then-named Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations (now the Duncan Black Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations). In addition to his work with interfaith dialogue, Abu-Rabi\u2018 specialized in issues of contemporary Islamic thought, particularly in relation to religion and society and mysticism. In 2006 he was the Senior Fulbright Scholar in Singapore and Indonesia whilst based at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies on the Nanyang Technological University campus. In 2008 Abu-Rabi\u2018 was appointed the first holder of the Edmonton Council of Muslim Communities Chair in Islamic Studies at the University of Alberta, the first teaching and research chair of its kind in Canada. Ibrahim Abu-Rabi\u2018 died of a sudden heart attack on 2 July 2011 while attending a conference in Amman, Jordan. \"I am greatly saddened to learn of the sudden loss of one of our own, professor Ibrahim Abu-Rabi\u2018, chair of Islamic studies,\" said university President Indira Samarasekera. \"As a mentor and a teacher, he was well known for his passion for teaching and his dedication to building understanding between people of various faiths. He will be remembered for his enthusiasm for his work, his unwavering support of his colleagues and students, and his care and compassion for all. \". He also had two kids. Abu-Rabi\u2018 was a devoted researcher and a prolific writer, with numerous titles to his credit. His work The Contemporary Arab Reader on Political Islam (University of Alberta Press, 2010) is a collection of writings from highly influential figures in the field of Islamism that attempts to address misunderstood notions of contemporary Islam. In an interview from the spring 2011 edition of WOA (Work of Arts), the U of A Faculty of Arts alumni magazine, Abu-Rabi\u2018 said, \"most Islamist groups are pro-democracy and anti-violence, but you\u2019d never know this from what\u2019s reported in the press. I wanted to give Islamists the chance to speak for themselves. \" The professor expressed a belief that out of the many books written in the West that purport to explain Islamism, virtually all have been written by westerners; that is, Islamist voices have remained largely absent. A curriculum vitae (CV) containing Abu-Rabi\u2018's publications is available on the website of the Hartford Theological Seminary, where he taught before moving to the University of Alberta. Abu-Rabi\u2018 was affiliated with the International Council for Middle East Studies in Washington, DC and a list of his publications was placed on the Council's website.

He made aliyah to Israel in 1966, remaining in Beersheba, where he ran a yeshiva. Abuhatzeira was known for his work and influence with business and political leaders, as well as his study of Kabbalah. Abuhatzeira, who had studied at Porat Yosef Yeshiva, had a following as a spiritual leader. He was one of Israel's leading kabbalists, and appeared in a list of the country's wealthiest people, with estimated assets of $80 million in 2011. Abuhatzeira was known for wearing a cloak whose long hood covered most of his face, reportedly so he would not see any \"immodest images of women\". He had a tunnel dug between his home in Beersheba and the yeshiva he headed, where he received believers. In 1997, an investigation by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, led by the journalist Yossi Bar-Moha, linked several incidents of corruption to Abuhatzeira. The articles further claimed that Abuhatzeira tried to impress people, persuaded them to pay him in exchange for a blessing, and threatened them with a curse if necessary. The 1997 report claimed that Abuhatzeira had sold land designated for a religious girls school instead of building the school, and was evading municipal property taxes. Bar-Moha discovered that the Rabbi's bank account contained NIS 250 million in gifts and contributions. The articles prompted a police investigation against Abuhatzeira. In 2003, Abuhatzeira was ordered to pay NIS 100 million to the Israel Tax Authority on money he received from followers, but in the end reached settlement to pay NIS 20 million to charitable organizations. By 2004, Bar Moha claimed that the Rabbi's income had grown to NIS 500 million (USD 141 million in 2004 values), and he filed a joint petition with the Progressive Judaism Movement to the Israeli Supreme Court, demanding the tax settlement to be cancelled. The petition was dismissed. In 2009, a man was indicted for threatening to kill Abuhatzeira, claiming that the rabbi made him a medical promise that had not come true. In 2010 Rabbi Abuhatzeira was accused by New York Jews of charging hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange promised miracles that never came to fruition The prosecutor in Brooklyn subsequently opened an investigation, and Abuhatzeira stopped traveling to the United States as a result. Yossi Bar Moha, the journalist who investigated the Rabbi in 1997, claimed that \"Elazar Abuhatzeira is a charlatan, con man and impostor who takes advantage of people's innocence, exploits them and brings to the verge of poverty\". One of the students of the Rabbi defended him, saying that the Rabbi is humble and modest, and would never do such a thing. Other disciples acknowledge that the rabbi was wealthy, but insisted he used his wealth for the poor, citing, for instance, a huge house owned by the rabbi which included a soup kitchen where hundreds of poor people were fed on a daily basis. Elazar Abuhatzeira was murdered on 28 July 2011 in his Beersheba yeshiva, while hosting guests for consultation. According to an initial police investigation, the rabbi was stabbed in the upper body after receiving the killer for a private audience. The attacker, 42-year-old Asher Dahan of El'ad, was said to have been unhappy with marital advice the rabbi had given him. Dahan stabbed Abuhatzeira in the upper body before being subdued by his students, who handed him over to police. Magen David Adom personnel attempted to resuscitate him before rushing him by ambulance to Soroka Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Abuhatzeira's funeral was held in Jerusalem on 29 July, and the rabbi was buried on the Mount of Olives. The funeral was attended by tens of thousands of people, including Israel's chief rabbis, haredi ministers, and Knesset members. Eulogies were delivered at the Porat Yosef Yeshiva and the Jerusalem neighborhood of Geula.

"}, {"text": "Barry Allan Ackerley (April 15, 1934 \u2013 March 21, 2011) was an American businessman. He was the former chairman and CEO of the Ackerley Group media company. He was also the owner of the Seattle SuperSonics basketball franchise from 1983 to 2001 and the Seattle Storm basketball franchise from 2000 to 2001. Born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1934, Barry Ackerley began his career in the advertising industry selling space for the magazine Better Homes & Gardens. In 1964, he approached a wealthy family in Wichita, Kansas, and asked for their financial assistance in acquiring billboards. The family agreed and, as a minority shareholder in the venture, Ackerley purchased billboards in Fresno and Bakersfield, California. Over the next four years, Ackerley purchased additional billboards in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose, California. By 1968, the billboards in northern California had generated enough income to provide Ackerley with the start-up capital he had lacked in New York five years earlier. He sold his interest in the venture back to his benefactors and, with a new partner, parlayed the proceeds toward the establishment of an outdoor advertising company, Golden West Outdoor Advertising. Golden West, had billboards in Sacramento, California, and in Colorado until 1974, when Ackerley purchased his partner's share in the company then sold the company to Gannett Company. With the money garnered from the sale to Gannett, Ackerley, after a brief return to the Northeast to work for an advertising firm, relocated to Seattle, Washington, in 1975 and purchased Seattle-based Foster & Kleiser from Metromedia Inc. and Obie Outdoor Advertising based in Eugene, Oregon. The acquisition of these two outdoor advertising companies formed the beginnings of Ackerley's new company, named Northwest Communications, Inc. in 1975 initially, and renamed Ackerley Communications, Inc. the following year. From there the new company would begin to acquire broadcast television stations and radio stations in the early 1980s. After mainly transitioning to a broadcast media company, the company would be sold to sold to Clear Channel Communications in 2001 for $1. 1 billion. In 1983 Ackerley purchased the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association from original owner Sam Schulman. Ackerley began exploring new options for an arena. Heavy relocation rumors began to circulate, amongst them a potential move to San Diego or possible sales to groups in other markets like Milwaukee or Toronto. In 2018, Ackerley's son Chris would say that the family was always committed to keeping the team in Seattle, and that \"in each case, we stood on our principles that this is a Seattle community asset. \"Briefly, the Ackerleys talked about building an arena east of Lake Washington near the mall in Bellevue. They would eventually purchase land in the SoDo District near the Kingdome, some of which included the site that would become the Mariners' current home, T-Mobile Park. Ackerley approached the city about a public contribution to the new arena, but the city was reluctant over fears the city-owned Coliseum would become obsolete. They offered to help finance a renovation of the Coliseum, but the team owner declined. To sweeten the offer, Ackerley sold city leaders on the idea that the new arena in SoDo could also attract an NHL club. The city, along with Denver, had been conditionally granted an expansion NHL franchise in 1974 to begin play in the 1976\u201377 season. The NHL briefly flirted with relocating the Pittsburgh Penguins to Seattle (and the California Golden Seals to Denver) to address a troubled market and fill the expansion commitment, but ultimately kept the team there. Eventually, the Seattle franchise award was rescinded altogether when the potential ownership group was unable to secure the funds for the expansion fee. In July 1990, the city council approved a deal for a privately-owned $100 million facility to be built on the Ackerley land in SoDo, despite objections over traffic and parking by the Seahawks and Mariners in the neighboring Kingdome. The city's contribution would be to waive about $31 million in tax revenues (about $1 million per year) to potentially be collected on admissions fees at the new arena. It would also pay $2 million for street improvements around the proposed site, including a pedestrian walkway over South Royal Brougham Way. Ackerley also agreed to sign a 30-year lease for the Sonics and to build an 1,800-stall parking garage. Ackerley appeased the Seahawks' concerns, noting the arena would be empty during any NFL games. The Mariners unsuccessfully continued to object, even enlisting then-Major League Baseball commissioner Faye Vincent and then-American League president Bobby Brown to speak before the council ahead of their final vote. During negotiations, Ackerley had asked for a provision to reduce the seating at the Coliseum by 9,000 seats so the older arena couldn't compete with the new building, but the city would not agree. Another selling point of the new arena were luxury suites, a means to attract corporate money and sponsorship that was then an emerging new revenue stream for sports team owners. Ackerley's financing and agreement with the city hinged on the ability to sell the 70 proposed luxury suites. Ackerley also committed to submitting an expansion application to the NHL by a September 15, 1990 deadline as part of the arena deal. His son Bill would head the expansion effort, while a competing group led by Microsoft executive Chris Larson and former Seattle Totems player then coach Bill MacFarland was preparing their own application. With the Ackerley application already submitted, the two groups would merge with Larson and MacFarland being primary points of contact with the NHL. Then owner of the Seattle Thunderbirds, Bill Yuill, also joined the group. Larson and MacFarland, along with Barry Ackerley and Bill Lear, Ackerley's financial advisor, were set to make a presentation to the NHL's Board of Governors on December 5, 1990. At the meeting, Ackerley and Lear asked to meet with the board first, promptly withdrew their application, and left. Larson and MacFarland were stunned to learn of the development but were unable to pursue any recourse as their names were never on the submitted application. Thought to play a factor in Ackerley's decision were the significant demands by the NHL for an expansion team: a $50 million expansion fee that was more than any NHL club was valued at the time; a $5 million down payment that would be forfeited if 10,000 season tickets weren't sold in the first year \u2013 the Sonics had never sold more than 9,000 season tickets; season tickets needed to produce at least $9 million annually, which would've made the tickets the second most expensive for a team in the area at the time; a 20-year lease with a \"substantial\" share of arena revenues from concessions, parking, and ad signage; priority status for postseason arena dates; and a secured $5 million line of credit in case the league had to take over ownership of the team at any point. Ackerley would not sacrifice Sonics revenues for a hockey team in which he would be a minority investor. Seattle would eventually get a NHL team in 2018 when the Seattle NHL team was approved to begin play in 2021. In June 1991, nearly a year after the city agreed to the arena deal, Ackerley announced that the project would not move forward. Increasing project costs, legal disputes, and inability to secure construction financing were cited as reasons to drop the project. Only around 30 of the 70 luxury suites were sold and the Ackerleys were unable to find a corporate buyer for naming rights. Ackerley Communications profits were down, which also contributed to the financing difficulties. A state Supreme Court case brought by Seattle Center employees challenged the constitutionality of the arena deal, while potential lawsuits from the Mariners and trade show organizers and possible legal challenges to environmental review of the project loomed. Seattle Center Arena was extensively remodeled in 1995 for the Sonics. In 2000, Ackerley and his wife Ginger launched the Seattle Storm of the WNBA. Both the SuperSonics and Storm were sold in 2001 to Howard Schultz. Ackerley died on March 21, 2011, two days after suffering a stroke.

He attempted to create sculpture and events that probed the history of nuclear engineering and asked questions about the long-term storage of nuclear waste. For 15 years he lived in Richland, Washington, the dormitory town for the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, at one time home to nine nuclear reactors and five plutonium-processing complexes and the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States. His major ambition while there was to build a \"nuclear Stonehenge\" on a heavily contaminated area of land in the site, incorporating twelve uranium breeder-blanket assemblies. Acord was the only private individual in the world licensed to own and handle radioactive materials, and acquired nuclear fuel rods containing depleted uranium from the completed but not operated German SNR-300 breeder reactor to use as artistic materials. He had his nuclear license number tattooed onto his neck. He spoke on art and nuclear science at both art and nuclear industry events in the US and the UK and organised many forums that brought together artists, activists and nuclear industry experts.

He was critically most famous for the \"fiendish\" translation of Georges Perec's postmodern novel A Void, in which the letter e is not used, but was more widely known for the films adapted from his novels, including Love and Death on Long Island (1997) and The Dreamers (2003). Adair was born in Edinburgh but from 1968 to 1980 he lived in Paris. His early works of fiction included Alice Through the Needle's Eye (following Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass) and Peter Pan and the Only Children (following Peter and Wendy). He won the Author's Club First Novel Award in 1988 for his novel The Holy Innocents. From 1992 to 1996 he wrote the \"Scrutiny\" column for The Sunday Times. During 1998 and 1999 he was the chief film critic of The Independent on Sunday, where in 1999 he also wrote a year-long column called \"The Guillotine\". In 1995 he won the Scott Moncrieff Translation Prize for his book A Void, which is a translation of the French book La Disparition by Georges Perec. The original book contains no instances of the letter e; Adair translated it with the same limitation. His works are compared to those of Julian Barnes, A. S. Byatt and Patrick Gale. His book Flickers: A History of the Cinema in 100 Images was admired by David Foster Wallace. The film Love and Death on Long Island (1997), directed by Richard Kwietniowski, was based on his 1990 novel of the same name. The film The Dreamers (2003) directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, with a script by Adair, was based on his book The Holy Innocents, which Adair revised and re-released under the same title as the film.

Due to his business involvements, Adams was also a prominent figure in Baltimore politics, although he never held office himself. William L. Adams was born on January 5, 1914 in Zebulon, North Carolina, and moved to Baltimore in 1929. Adams attended Dunbar High School for several years, and worked several jobs during that time, including running numbers. He eventually ended up running his own numbers game. He married Victorine Quille on October 13, 1935 at St. Peter Claver Catholic Church. Adams used the profits from his illegal lottery to finance a number of legitimate businesses, including a real estate firm and a tavern. He owned Carr's Beach, a popular amusement park in Annapolis, MD, Since most banks would not lend to black-owned businesses at that time, Adams found opportunity investing in such businesses. His most successful investments included Parks Sausages and Super Pride supermarkets. By the late 1970s, Adams' wealth was estimated at $40M. In 1951, Adams was subpoenaed to testify before Congress during an investigation into organized crime. At that time, he admitted to having run an illegal lottery in Baltimore, and the State of Maryland subsequently charged with that crime. His conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the state had violated Adams' Fifth Amendment rights by using his Congressional testimony. In 1980, Adams was again charged with running an illegal lottery. He was found not guilty of these charges. Adams was instrumental in the election of Maryland's first black US Representative, Parren Mitchell.

Adamson, a right-half, joined Burnley in January 1947 after playing non-league football in his native Ashington and working as a miner. His early career was interrupted by national service, which he completed with the Royal Air Force, meaning his debut had to wait until February 1951, when Burnley played away to Bolton Wanderers. He played once for the England B team, but never made the full England side. He was an ever-present as Burnley won the First Division in 1959\u201360 and captained the side to the 1962 FA Cup Final which they lost against Tottenham Hotspur. He was also named Footballer of the Year in 1962. Adamson formed a midfield partnership with inside-forward Jimmy McIlroy, around which much of Burnley's creative play was centred. He retired in 1964, having played 426 league games, and joined the Burnley coaching staff. He had previously coached the England team in the 1962 World Cup in Chile and was the Football Association's preferred choice of manager ahead of Alf Ramsey but declined the offer. In February 1970, when Burnley manager Harry Potts was made general manager, Adamson stepped up to become team manager. Burnley were relegated at the end his first full season in charge, but returned to the top-flight in 1973, winning the Second Division title. Burnley were relegated again in 1976, although Adamson had already left that January. In May 1976 he was appointed as manager of Dutch side Sparta Rotterdam, but left the following month. In November 1976 he was made manager of Sunderland, but was unable to prevent them from relegation from the First Division. He left Sunderland in November 1978, taking over from Jock Stein as manager of Leeds United. His time at Leeds is well remembered for the huge roars of \"Adamson Out\" with which the crowd greeted his later appearances. He left Leeds in October 1980.

Addison attended the University of South Carolina and was drafted by the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League (NFL) and the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League (CFL), but chose to sign in 1960 with the Boston Patriots of the newly formed American Football League (NFL), playing his entire pro career with the Patriots. Considered a leader of the newly formed team, Addison was selected as team captain, and was named to the AFL All-Star team for four straight years(1961\u20131964), as well as being one of the first players ever selected to be a Patriot All-League player (in 1960). He was also a Sporting News' All-League player in 1963 and 1964, and an AFL Eastern Division All-Star in 1961 and 1962. With 16 career interceptions (returning one for a touchdown), he was considered by many to be the best AFL linebacker against the run in the mid 1960s. Addison played in every Patriots' game from 1961 to 1966 (84 games), and was adding to this total when he sustained what proved to be a career-ending knee injury. On June 18, 1968, he was released by the Patriots after team doctors stated that he would risk further damage by playing after having undergone two knee operations. Addison was selected by a Patriot fan vote in 1971 as a member of the Patriots' All-1960s (AFL) Team. On January 14, 1964, players in the American Football League formed the AFL Players Association, and Addison was elected the union's first president. In search of protection for the players, Addison put together a request package of benefits that included insurance and a player pension plan. As president, Addison had the intimidating task of meeting with the team owners to communicate the request. Upon entering the meeting room, Addison approached the long oval table, where the stern-faced owners were awaiting. With Southern charm, he looked up at the owners, smiled, and said \"Well, I'm not trying to be the next Jimmy Hoffa!\" This broke the tension, and started a period of perhaps the most positive relationship between owners and players in team sports history. With a players association in place, players newly drafted by American Football League teams in the \"war between the leagues\" could be assured that they would have representation and protection in the AFL that was the equal of that in the older league. Addison's work was an important element in the survival of the league, and helped the AFL to be able to compete for top talent, and to establish itself as the future of Professional Football.

Born in Nauru, and educated in Australia, including at the Australian School of Pacific Administration, Adeang was first elected to the Parliament of Nauru in 1971, representing the seat of Ubenide, and became a noted opponent of Hammer DeRoburt, the country's first president. He first became president in 1986, serving two short terms at the end of that year. In the following year, 1987, Adeang was involved in the establishment of the Democratic Party of Nauru, one of the first political parties in Nauru. He again served as president in late 1996, but lost power after a motion of no confidence. Adeang was active in parliament until 2000, serving at various times in the Cabinet, and also as Speaker from February 1997 to December 1998. In 2007, he was appointed High Commissioner to the Republic of Fiji, serving in the position until his death in 2011. His son, David Adeang, also served in the Nauruan parliament, occupying the same constituency as his father. Adeang was born in Nauru and educated in Nauru and Australia, attending the Australian School of Pacific Administration (ASOPA) from 1962 to 1963. He was first elected to parliament for the seat of Ubenide in 1971, replacing Derog Gioura, but was forced to resign a few months later; Gioura re-took his seat in the parliament. Adeang was re-elected in 1973 to serve a second term but lost his seat again to Gioura in the 1976 elections. In the 1977 snap elections, Adeang was re-elected but had to resign once again to leave Gioura the seat. In 1980, both Adeang and Gioura were elected to parliament and they both served long-time terms from then on. Adeang had to resign again in 1987 for two months but was re-elected in the following by-election. Adeang was regarded as a strong opponent of Hammer DeRoburt, who had served as Nauru's first president. Adeang served twice as President of Nauru in 1986. In September of that year, he was elected by a margin of one vote over the incumbent DeRoburt but was ousted following a vote of no confidence after only 14 days. Following a general election in December, he was again elected as president only to lose the office following another vote of no confidence. He was replaced by DeRoburt. In 1987, Adeang was involved in the establishment of the Democratic Party of Nauru, one of the first official groupings of Nauruan parliamentarians since the 1970s. Adeang again held the Presidency of Nauru in November and December 1996. He gained office following a vote of no confidence in November 1996 but lost it in the same way in December of the same year. Following the February 1997 election, Adeang served in the Cabinet of President Kinza Clodumar. Early in 1998, in his capacity as Speaker, Adeang required five members of the house to resign, including the former President Lagumot Harris, following remarks made about him in an opposition newsletter. Following elections later that year, three of those members were re-elected. Adeange retired from parliament in April 2000.

Ader was a professor emeritus at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Robert Ader was born on February 20, 1932 in the Bronx, New York City. He was the older of two sons of Nathan and Mae Ader. After graduating from the Horace Mann School in New York City, he attended Tulane University in New Orleans. He graduated from Tulane University with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1953. Ader then went on to earn a Ph. D. in psychology from Cornell University in 1957. After earning his Ph. D. , he became a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Rochester and a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester School of Medicine & Dentistry. He spent his time at the University of Rochester conducting psychobiological research on animals. Robert Ader spent his entire career at the University of Rochester, where he held many teaching and research positions. He was appointed the director of the Division of Behavioral and Psychosocial Medicine in the University of Rochester\u2019s department of psychology and director of the Center for Psychoneuroimmunology Research. He retired in July 2011 as professor emeritus of psychosocial medicine. During his career, he authored and helped coauthor over two hundred journal articles and chapters in books. He also founded the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity which he served as editor-in-chief for many years. He also served on editorial boards for various psychobiological and behavioral journals. In addition, he served as president of the American Psychosomatic Society from 1979 to 1982, president of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology from 1981 to 1982, president of the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research from 1984 to 1985, and president and founder of the Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society. He also received an honorary M. D. degree from the University of Trondheim in Norway. On beginning his career as a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester, Robert Ader focused his research on behavioral conditioning and emotional responsiveness in rats. In 1974, he and a fellow researcher Nicholas Cohen were studying taste aversion in rats. The researchers gave the rats water sweetened with saccharin followed by an injection of cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressant which caused nausea. Through classical conditioning, the rats learned to avoid water that contained saccharin. When Ader and Cohen began to force feed the rats the saccharin solution, they noticed that the rats began to die. They also found that the rate of death was directly related to how much saccharin solution the rats consumed. From these findings, they proposed a theory that the rats died because the taste of saccharin by itself was enough to elicit neural signals in the rats\u2019 brain that suppressed their immune systems as if they had been overdosed with cyclophosphamide. Due to weakened immune systems, the rats contracted bacterial and viral infections that they were unable to fight off. This finding led to the belief that there are connections between the brain and the immune system which contradicted with the previous belief that the immune system was autonomous. This serendipitous discovery led Robert Ader to continue research in and develop the field of psychoneuroimmunology, a term that he created and first used in his 1980 presidential speech to the American Psychosomatic Society. A year later, he also used the newly created term as the title for his collection of essays that described the beginning of a new field of research. Robert Ader spent 54 years at the University of Rochester until his retirement in 2011. Ader died at the Highlands at Pittsford, New York, on December 20, 2011, at the age of 79.

In January 2009, Adler announced his first bill as a U. S. Representative: the Safeguarding America's Seniors and Veterans Act, which mandated a one-time payment of $500 to persons eligible for Social Security, railroad retirement, or veterans disability benefits. According to a statement by Adler's office, the bill was necessary because \"the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 fails to address the needs of our seniors and veterans\".

By this time, the district had been renumbered as New Jersey's 3rd congressional district. On November 9, 2007, Saxton announced that he would not seek reelection in 2008, citing prostate cancer. This dramatically altered the dynamics of the race; instead of facing a 25-year incumbent, Adler was now running in an open seat. Adler was unopposed in the Democratic primary, and faced Republican Medford Mayor, Lockheed Martin executive, and Gulf War veteran Chris Myers. During the 2008 election cycle, Adler was one of the first elected officials in New Jersey to endorse Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination in a state where the party establishment supported Hillary Clinton. Adler held a financial advantage over his opponent through all of the race, holding a 10\u20131 or 5\u20131 funding edge over Myers for a majority of the campaign. Adler had raised the most money in the country of any non-incumbent congressional candidate. Adler received a number of endorsements for the election, including those from the Teamsters, Fraternal Order of Police, National Association of Police Organizations, Professional Firefighters Association of New Jersey, New Jersey Environmental Federation, The Sierra Club, the Humane Society Legislative Fund, The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Health Care, and the Recreational Fishing Alliance. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee committed $1. 7 million in ad buys to Adler's campaign. In comparison, the NRCC committed $84,200 in coordinated ad buys with the Myers campaign, in addition to help the NRCC gave in financing an internal poll in September with the Myers campaign. Myers also benefited from two ad buys by the 501(c)(4) organization Freedom's Watch, which attacked John Adler on his tax record, his legislative history, and contributions he received from subprime mortgage companies. Adler won a majority of newspaper endorsements. He was endorsed by the Press of Atlantic City, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The New York Times, the Burlington County Times, the Courier Post, Myers received the endorsement of the Asbury Park Press. The 3rd district race was the last one to be called in New Jersey on Election Night 2008. Adler ultimately defeated Myers with 52. 08% of the vote to Myers' 47. 92%. He was sworn into his position as the Congressman from the 3rd district of New Jersey in the United States House of Representatives on January 6, 2009, the first Democrat to represent this district in 123 years. The district was the 1st for most of the time until 1967, then was the 6th from 1967 to 1983, the 13th from 1983 to 1993, and has been the 3rd since 1993. Adler lost the 2010 midterm election to Republican nominee Jon Runyan. Adler received 47. 3% of the vote, while Runyan received slightly more than half the votes cast. Runyan is a former Philadelphia Eagles star and a Mount Laurel resident. In addition to Runyan, Adler was challenged by NJ Tea Party nominee Peter DeStefano, Libertarian nominee Russ Conger, and Your Country Again nominee Lawrence J. Donahue. Republicans heavily targeted this seat in this election cycle. A warning sign for Adler came in the New Jersey gubernatorial race in 2009, when Republican candidate Chris Christie carried Adler's district by 17 points over Democratic Governor Jon Corzine Governor Christie campaigned hard for Runyan, calling Adler a \"career politician\". Some Democratic operatives asserted that Adler campaign staffers and the Camden County Democratic Committee (CCDC) recruited Tea Party candidate Peter DeStefano in an attempt to split the conservative vote and benefit Adler. New Jersey Tea Party groups said they had never heard of DeStefano until he had a strong showing in a July poll released by the Adler campaign. On October 8, 2010, the Associated Press reported, based on the details of an earlier article at CourierPostOnline. com, that there was \"mounting evidence\" that the Democrats recruited DeStefano. The article noted that a Democratic Party employee ran DeStefano's website and that many of the signatures on DeStefano's nominating petitions belonged to Democrats - including a former Adler campaign staffer. Reportedly, Steve Ayscue, the paid head of operations for CCDC, and Geoff Mackler, Adler's campaign manager, presented a plan at CCDC Headquarters during a May 26 meeting of the South Jersey Young Democrats, and some of those present soon joined in circulating a petition to place Peter DeStefano on the ballot. Adler denied the allegations. DeStefano called the suggestion that he was a Democratic plant \"a bunch of crap\". In the end, DeStefano garnered only 1. 5% of the vote. Adler met his wife Shelley in law school. He converted to her faith of Judaism in 1985, having been raised an Episcopalian. After they graduated, they returned to South Jersey and settled down in Cherry Hill. They resided in Cherry Hill with their four sons until his death. In March 2011, Adler contracted a staph infection which resulted in endocarditis leading to emergency surgery. He never recovered and died on April 4, 2011. In 2012, Shelley Adler unsuccessfully ran against Runyan for Adler's old U. S. House seat.

She was born in Bari, Italy to N\u00fczhet Ha\u015fim Sinano\u011flu, a writer and consular official of Turkey and his wife R\u00fcveyde, a journalist and writer. Esin was the youngest of five siblings. Her brother, Oktay Sinano\u011flu, became a notable professor of chemistry. Other brothers became professor of Latin, professor of Ancient Greek and Press Chief at European Council in Strasbourg. She attended TED Ankara Koleji, and then studied piano at the Ankara State Conservatory. After graduation, she entered Turkish State Opera and Ballet as a pianist. But then her focus shifted to the stage. She married Kerim Af\u015far, another stage artist. After 12 years of stage she returned to music and began singing in French and Italian. But after collaborating with Ruhi Su, she included Turkish folk music (t\u00fcrk\u00fc) to her repertoire. After she got a divorce from Kerim Af\u015far, she was married to \u015eener Aral in 1975. After the mid 1980s, she was mainly active in foreign tours. She also played parts in drama. In 1999, she was hospitalized and her recovery was slow. Although she briefly returned to concerts and album recordings, Af\u015far died on 14 November 2011 in a hospital in Istanbul, where she was taken due to leukemia about three weeks earlier. She was laid to rest at the Karacaahmet Cemetery. She was survived by her husband \u015eener Aral, son Do\u011fan Can and daughter P\u0131nar. Although her repertoire included a wide collection of various melodies of different tastes, her fame mainly stems from Turkish folklore. In 1969 two of her arranged folklore melodies became hits. These were Bana seni gerek (lyrics by Yunus Emre (1240-1321) and composition by Esin Af\u015far herself) and Yoh Yoh (by contemporary folklore poet Kul Ahmet). The melody on the reverse side of the Yoh Yoh 45rpm, was Bebek, a well known anonymous Turkmen folklore melody. After the release of Yoh Yoh she was nicknamed \"Bayan Yoh Yoh\" (\"Mrs. Yoh Yoh\"). She was sent to Hungary by \u0130hsan Sabri \u00c7a\u011flayangil, the minister of Foreign Affairs as an official representative of Turkish culture. In 1970, she gave a series of concerts in Italy. In 1972, she visited Soviet Union (especially those republics which would soon be called Turkic Republics) and South Korea. In 1973, she was in Israel, Great Britain, Belgium and Tunis and in 1974 in Australia. She also participated in the Turkish under contest to nominate a Turkish participant for the Eurovision Song Contest 1975. In 1980, in a live TV program, she sang a melody with lyrics from Naz\u0131m Hikmet and her melodies were banned by the military junta. In 1985, she gave a concert in Paris. In 1988, she appeared in concerts at Lausanne, Switzerland, and the next year, in 1989 at Mulhouse, France. Esin Af\u015far was strictly against a new style of music in Turkey emerged after the 1970s, named Arabesque, which was similar to Arabic music with Turkish lyrics.

He was among the first to take part in aerial archaeology in France, and helped to develop a methodology for aerial prospecting. Agache was born in Amiens, Picardy and died in Abbeville, Picardy. Agache earned PhD in art history and archeology. His doctoral thesis was Atlas d'Arch\u00e9ologie a\u00e9rienne de Picardie, 1975; La Somme pr\u00e9romaine et romaine, d'apr\u00e8s les prospections a\u00e9riennes \u00e0 basse altitude (The Pre-Roman and Roman Somme, Based on Low-Altitude Aerial Prospecting), completed in 1978. Agache studied Paleolithic and Neolithic and then directed its research toward aerial archaeology in northern France, beginning in 1959. His early research helped to show that Gallo-Roman agriculture was more extensive and well-developed than had been previously known. He was appointed Director of Prehistoric Antiquities for Nord-Picardie on 1 March, 1963. He was lecturer at the University of Caen, then researcher at CNRS. He is the author of more than 200 publications. Agache spent several thousand hours in the air, taking and later analysing photographs for evidence of ancient settlement and travel patterns. His thousands of aerial photographs have been placed with the Ministry of Culture, where they may be consulted, for the most part at the DRAC in Picardie. In 1978, Roger Agache was awarded the Grand Prix de G\u00e9ographie, and in 1983 he received the Grand Prix National de l'Arch\u00e9ologie. Agache was elected a correspondent of the Institut de France in 1991. The scientific community recognized him during the international conference at Amiens in 1992. Agache R.

Her best known work is La p\u00e9rgola de las flores, which, constituted \"one of the milestones in the history of Chilean theater in the second half of the 20th century. \" The daughter of Fernando Aguirre Err\u00e1zuriz and the painter Mar\u00eda Tupper Huneeus (1893\u20131965), Isidora Aguirre was a student at the Joan of Arc School in Santiago and later studied social work, literature, piano, modern ballet, and drawing from 1937 to 1939. When she was 21, in 1940, Nen\u00e9 (as she was called) married Gerardo Carmona, a refugee from the Spanish Civil War. She lived in the countryside for five years, and later went with him to Paris, where she began to earn a living as an illustrator, while continuing to study theater and cinema. Back in Chile, \"a chance encounter with the actor and theater director Hugo Miller on a trolleybus was decisive in defining her vocation and devoting herself completely to dramaturgy. \" Thus, in 1952 Aguirre enrolled in a drama course, dictated by him at the Chilean Academy of the Ministry of Education. \"From then on, her dedication to theatrical activity would lead her, on many occasions, to put aside her personal life, even. \"On her complete dedication to the theater, she said \"One always has to choose. It is not possible to be married and to write as I do. La p\u00e9rgola cost me tears. I had to spend whole days in the library looking for historical data, although I was expecting my youngest daughter and I would have liked to knit little coats. But the theater chose me. For Los papeleros, I spent months chatting with those who rummage through garbage cans. And Lautaro meant going, on horseback, to indigenous strongholds and living there. What husband supports that?\"Before devoting herself to the theater, she had begun to write children's stories \u2013 in 1938 she published a compilation of eight of them. She also published a novel for children in 1948. Isidora Aguirre recalled her first literary essays: \"I think it was at the age of six that I wrote a story that we later bound. It was called Los anteojos de Pepito and it was three pages with very large print. I did not write stories again until I was fifteen, when Marta Brunet, my mother's friend, entrusted me with the children's page of the magazine Familia. \"Like many Chilean playwrights during the 1950s and 1960s, her career began under the aegis of university theaters, institutions that, since the 1940s, generated a qualitative as well as a quantitative change in Chilean theatrical activity. With the foundation of the Experimental Theater of University of Chile in 1941, and the Trial Theater of Catholic University in 1943, a professional theater practice characterized by a greater artistic and technical rigor than the commercial theater began to develop. This in turn fostered both the production of plays and the creation of new theatrical groups, and an audience for that type of theater in the country. In 1955 she premiered her first comedies, Carolina and La dama del canasto, but very soon she dedicated herself to \"committed theater\", a genre to which a large part of her production belongs. To effect social protest, she experimented with various theatrical styles: comedy, musical comedy, farce, historical works, testimonial works, and popular theater. In 1959, she premiered her first tragedy, Poblaci\u00f3n Esperanza, of marked social content and written in conjunction with the novelist Manuel Rojas. The following year, she made the leap to fame with La p\u00e9rgola de las flores, a play which has been produced innumerable times and was made into a film of the same name by the Uruguayan-Argentine director Rom\u00e1n Vi\u00f1oly Barreto in 1965. Isidora Aguirre also wrote novels for adults. The first, Doy por vivido todo lo so\u00f1ado, published in 1987, is the fictionalized story of her mother. The second, Carta a Roque Dalton (1990), is dedicated to the Salvadoran writer and the love she shared with him in 1969, when she was a member of the Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas Prize jury, which Dalton won with his poetry collection Taberna y otros lugares. Finally, Santiago de diciembre a diciembre is a love story that takes place during the government of Salvador Allende and the military coup of 11 September 1973. She was professor of Chilean Theater and Dramatic Construction at University of Chile. She also taught at the Universidad T\u00e9cnica del Estado and the Arrau Corporation. After Augusto Pinochet took power in Chile, Isidora Aguirre, who remained in the country, lost her university job, but in her trips through Latin America, taught theater in workshops in Quito, Cali, Bogot\u00e1, and Mexico. She had two children with her first husband, Gerardo Carmona, and another two with the second, the Englishman Peter Sinclaire, from whom she also separated. Isidora Aguirre Tupper died on the night of 25 February 2011 due to an internal hemorrhage. As her friend and writer Virginia Vidal commented: \"To Isidora, Chile buried her owing her the National Prize for Literature that would have been a diminished recognition of her vast work as a novelist and dramatist. \"Posthumously, a fifth novel of Aguirre's was published, Guerreros del sur, written in collaboration with Renato Peruggi and with a prologue by Andrea Jeftanovic. The book is inspired by Lientur, the toqui who defeated the Spaniards at the Battle of Las Cangrejeras on 15 May 1629. In spite of her immense body of work, progressive spirit, defense of human rights, and patriotic activity, the Concertaci\u00f3n governments repeatedly denied the National Prize for Literature to Isidora Aguirre. This fact was recalled by the dramatist Juan Radrig\u00e1n in his acceptance speech for the prize in 2012. It narrates the fight that the Pergoleras of Santiago gave to not lose its traditional working places and the arrival of Carmela, a young peasant who arrived at the city of Santiago in the process of urbanization and modernization. It shows the contrast between the culture of the countryside and the capital; It is a story of love, of traditions, but also of negotiation between the lower classes and the authorities. It shows the indignant and inhuman subsistence carried by a group of collectors in the sixties, in a dump in the suburbs of Santiago. Different social conflicts are generated through key characters in the story, framed by poverty and discrimination. It represent the uprising and the subsequent massacre of peasant that took place in the southern town of Ranquil in 1934. The subject is the property right of the land, a very hot problem. It presents the facts in the Brechtian way, highlighting the internal contradictions of the characters.

Lately, he was the Professor of Mathematics at the Department of Mathematics, CIIT Islamabad. Dr. Rashid Ahmad also served as an academic scientist at the National Centre for Physics, and a Professor of Mathematics at the Centre for High Energy Physics of the Punjab University. Prof. Dr. Rashid Ahmad completed Matriculation with Sc. Hygiene & Physiology, in 1951, F. Sc with Pre-engineering in 1953 and then B. A with Double Math(A & B), in 1958. He then obtained M. A. Mathematics degree in 1958, all from Punjab University. After a gap of 11 years, he obtained a MSc Mathematics degree from Queens University, Canada, in 1969. Finally he completed his PhD Mathematics in 1971, from the same University. His thesis was on Measure Theory. Prof. Dr. Rashid Ahmad obtained a Roll of Honor from Govt. College Sargodha. Dr. Rashid first started teaching in 1958, and continued right up to the year before his death. This accounts for more than half a century of teaching and imparting knowledge to the young generation. \u201cI've known Dr. Rashid for almost forty years. First as a teacher, and more recently as a colleague. He taught me Abstract Algebra during my Masters, back in 1972. \" recalls Dr. Akhtar Hussain, a senior Mathematics Professor at CIIT, Pakistan. \u201cHe was a very strict administrator. \" Dr. Akhtar continues about his experiences with Dr. Rashid, \"We used to have forty minute periods back then, and some teachers made it a habit to arrive late and leave early. But Dr. Rashid used to inspect classrooms and keep the teachers in check. The students always used to appreciate this attitude of his. \u201d His records state his teaching experience (at both private and government institutions) to be more than thirty years, and his administrative experience to be more than twenty years. And his administrative experience has been that of the Principal of various government institutions Punjab over; as well as a period as the chairman of the board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. \"I was only able to have him teach me one course. \" A student of his expressed sadly, \"And he carried that one course with a distinctive style. He would begin his lecture the moment he entered the classroom, and continue without pausing for all ninety minutes. He wouldn't pay any heed to the shenanigans of the students in the room, knowing full well that his students understood that if they didn't hang on to his every word, they wouldn't be able to pass his course. And not that his assessment was strict, but because the subject he was teaching was unquestionably hard, and required the utmost understanding. \" She continued, overwhelmed by admiration, \"I was looking forward to have him teach me again. Because he was one of the rare teachers who reminded me why I want to spend the rest of my life chasing numbers and equations. Because, they may be hard, they may be complicated, they may be downright impossible; but if you work hard enough and long enough at them, you will be able to find that underlying charm and beauty that makes it worth your effort. \" One of his many contributions to the students of Mathematics Department at CIIT, includes his struggle with regards to the teaching of \"Set Theory and Logic\" in the 1st semester of BS rather than in 3rd( or even 4th). He thrived hard for this, and eventually, succeeded in bringing this subject down, initially to the 2nd semester and finally to the 1st. He used to argue that if Discrete Mathematics can be taught to the Computer Science students in the very first semester, than why not the Set Theory and Logic course could be taught to the Mathematics undergraduates in their first semester.

In 2011, he came under media attention when the United States accused him of being an associate of Dr. Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai, an Indian American lobbyist from Kashmir and founder of the Kashmir American Council (KAC) who was charged for covertly attempting to lobby and influence the American government on the Kashmir conflict on behalf of the Government of Pakistan's interests (see Pakistani lobby in the United States). Born in 1948, Ahmed obtained a master's degree in pharmacy from the University of Punjab in Lahore and later became a doctor of medicine after pursuing studies in internal medicine from abroad. Apart from the Shifa Foundation, Ahmad also founded the Tameer-e-Millat Foundation, a non-government organisation (NGO) aimed at uplifting education. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), after detaining and interrogating Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai charged Ahmad for having involvement with Fai in the scandal. However, Ahmad was living in, Islamabad, Pakistan at the time and was not apprehended by U. S. authorities. The FBI maintained that the two had been participating in a long-term conspiracy to act as agents of the Pakistani government in the United States without disclosing their affiliation, which is illegal. Thus, both potentially faced a sentence of five years in prison if convicted. Referring to Ahmad's shady contacts, one article published in the Indian newspaper Hindustan Times even alleged that Ahmad was present during the much-publicised nuclear scientist Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood's alleged meeting with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan one month prior to the September 11 attacks; it said that Ayman al-Zawahiri was also present at the meeting and that the discussion revolved around \"building a nuclear bomb. \" However, this allegation has never been proven or validated. According to U. S. government officials, Fai and Ahmad lobbied for the Kashmir cause secretly rather than making a formal declaration, as is required legally per the Foreign Agents Registration Act. It was claimed that the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) used Ahmad, who had contacts with the agency, as a channel through which they used to transfer large funds of money to Fai. On 7 October 2011, local media reported that Ahmad had died in Islamabad at the age of 63 due to brain haemorrhage. He left behind a widow and four children. His funeral was attended by many prominent politicians and bureaucrats and the salat al-Janazah (funeral prayer) was led by Qazi Hussain Ahmed. The News International remarked that the country had been deprived of a patriot \"who inspired a revolutionary change in the private health care sector of Pakistan through his stellar accomplishments. \" "}, {"text": "Hilal Al-Ahmadi (1954? \u2013 17 February 2011), who was an Iraqi veteran journalist with over 30 years of experience and well known for his reports about corruption, was assassinated in front of his home east of Mosul, Iraq. His death preceded by days the intimidation of the Iraqi press that occurred during the Arab Spring- inspired Iraqi protests. The response by major IGO and NGOs to Al-Ahmadi's killing was to denounce the \"culture of impunity\" in Iraq which leads to further violence against journalists. According to CNN, Al-Ahmadi had over 30 years of experience as a journalist. He wrote freelance for the Mosul Echo and the Iraqiyoun in Mosul, Iraq. He also wrote for al Hadba', al Isalah al Jadid, and al Sawt al Akhar He worked as a spokesperson for the communication services of the Ninawa Governorate but was let go shortly before his assassination. Hilal Al-Ahmadi often addressed financial and administrative corruption or the government's inability to supply services. In fact, Al-Ahmadi was well known for these kinds of reports. Al-Ahmadi was shot dead shortly before the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory's office was ransacked on 24 February by Iraqi soldiers and before the \"Day of Rage\" protests in Iraq. The nationwide protests in Iraq on 25 February were inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Protests also took place in major Iraqi cities Mosul, where Al-Ahmadi was attacked. The protests centered on corruption and lack of services that Al-Ahmadi had written about. Journalistic Freedoms Observatory estimated that 160 journalists had been detained after Al-Ahmadi's death and around the protests. For example, Hadi al-Mahdi was among the journalists who were either arrested or detained during those days. Reporters Without Borders called this time \u201cone of the blackest days for media freedom\u201d in Iraq. Hilal Al-Ahmadi, 57, was leaving his home for work 17 February 2011, when a car drove up to him. The car carried two men with automatic weapons who then shot the journalist. Al-Ahmadi was shot multiple times and was found dead in his suburb of Mithaq, located in Eastern Mosul, Iraq. Al-Ahmadi's body was taken to Mosul's department of forensic medicine. As with all the other cases of killed journalists in Iraq since 2003, the perpetrators have not been brought to justice. The overall reaction to Hilal Al-Ahmadi's death by organizations who defend the rights of journalists worldwide was frustration over Iraq's high impunity for such attacks. The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a CNN report and in reaction to Al-Ahmadi's death, \"Not a single journalist murder since 2003 has been seriously investigated by authorities, and not a single perpetrator has been brought to justice. \"According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Iraq was ranked #1 on the 2010 Impunity Index. The impunity index focuses on journalists who are killed on a recurring basis and the crimes often go unpunished. Iraq has been at the #1 spot for the last 3 years. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Julliard, who is secretary-general of Reporters Without Borders, said in an Agence France Press report about Al-Hamadi's death: \"The murders of journalists in Iraq are not letting up and generalized impunity is fuelling the cycle of violence. Very few of 232 murders of in Iraq (since 2003) have been thoroughly and conclusively investigated. Impunity must not prevail in Iraq. \"Mohamed Abdel Dayem, CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator, said: \"We call on the Iraqi authorities to vigorously investigate the killing of Hilal al-Ahmadi and bring those behind it to justice. It is time for the government to take the long-delayed initial steps toward ending a years-long record of impunity for journalist murders in Iraq. \"Aidan White, who is the general secretary of the International Federation of Journalists, said, \"The lack of credible action on violence against media sends a dangerous sign to media predators,\" added White. \"It encourages further attacks and the Iraqi authorities need to end this culture of impunity. \"Irina Bokova, who is the director-general of UNESCO, said: \"I condemn the murder of Iraqi freelance journalist Hilal al-Ahmadi. Attacking journalists cannot be tolerated. By denying citizens access to information, these crimes tear at the very fabric of emerging democracies. They must be investigated and punished. \" Hilal al-Ahmadi was married and had four children.

He was particularly associated with the works of Gian Carlo Menotti, and is best remembered for creating the role of King Melchior in the world premiere of Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors. Born in Benton, Illinois, Aiken studied English at Southern Illinois Normal College, where he matriculated in 1935. While a student there he was a member of the university's choir and studied singing privately with Grace Duty in Marion, Illinois. After earning his diploma in 1939, he briefly worked as a high school English teacher and track coach before accepting a post with the St. Louis Municipal Opera. He left that position in 1942 to join the USAAC, where he was trained as a fighter pilot and commissioned as a second lieutenant. He spent the remainder of World War II flying the Consolidated B-24 Liberator for missions in both Germany and Italy. He remained a reserve officer and command pilot in the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant colonel up through 1972. After World War II, Aiken pursued further studies in music at the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University Bloomington. Shortly after completing these studies, he made his debut on Broadway in May 1950 in the original production of Gian Carlo Menotti's The Consul; having replaced George Jongeyans as Mr. Kofner. After the show closed the following November, he and several of the other Broadway cast members took the show on tour for performances in Paris and London. He later returned to Broadway in March 1954 to create the role of Eddington in the original production of Sigmund Romberg's The Girl in Pink Tights. He left that show in June 1954 only to return to Broadway the following December to originate the role of Salvatore in the premiere of Menotti's The Saint of Bleecker Street. After the critical success of The Consul, Menotti was invited by NBC to compose an opera for television which was to be performed by the newly created NBC Opera Theatre (NBCOT). What resulted was the highly successful Christmas opera Amahl and the Night Visitors which was premiered on Christmas Eve of 1951 in a national broadcast to millions. For this production, Menotti enlisted the forces of many of the singers from The Consul; including Aiken who was cast in the role of King Melchior. He continued to portray that role, along with the other original adult cast members, for annual live television broadcasts up through 1962. They also gave annual national tours of Amahl, performing with symphony orchestras in concerts throughout the United States. In 1968 Aiken joined the voice faculty at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music where he taught for many years. During the 1970s and 1980s he operated the David Aiken Touring Opera Company which presented annual tours of Amahl and the Night Visitors.

Nicknamed \u2018Honeybear\u2019, Akins was the first World Champion boxer from St. Louis. Akins was born and died in St. Louis, Missouri. Akins was considered lanky, but proved nevertheless to be a powerful hitter with either hand. He began his career as a Lightweight in 1948, continuing to fight in that division for 6 years before finally growing into the Welterweight class. He was long considered to be an effective operator and boasted wins over future World Champions Joe Brown and Wallace \u2018Bud\u2019 Smith, as well as ending the incredible forty-seven fight winning streak of Ronnie Delaney, by way of knock-out in 1955. Akins had powered his way up the rankings in both divisions and finally got his chance of a World title once Carmen Basilio relinquished the Welterweight Championship to concentrate on defending his new Middleweight crown. An elimination tournament including six of the World\u2019s top-rated Welterweights was swiftly established in an effort to find Basilio\u2019s successor. Akins emerged the victor and new World Champion on June 6, 1958 by pounding favourite Vince Martinez to a fourth round destruction. All told, Martinez went down nine times, having never seriously recovered from a shattering right delivered early in the First. Akins's reign would not last long however. Six months later, he lost his title to Don Jordan by way of unanimous decision and in only his first defense. Akins disputed the result but fared no better in the return, held the following Spring. From that moment on, it was downhill all the way for the former champion, who would win just ten of his last twenty-three fights before hanging up his gloves in 1962.

He was the first president of KK Crvena zvezda. Aksentijevi\u0107 graduated from the journalistic and diplomatic school and has been engaged in journalism since 1948. From the beginning of his journalistic career he worked in the Tanjug Agency, firstly in the domestic politic department, and since 1950 in the foreign policy section. Aksentijevi\u0107 was reporting from Greece, Republic of the Congo and Lebanon. He was an outstanding connoisseur not only for the Palestinian problem but also and the Kurdish issue. During his rich journalistic career, he met with numerous foreign politicians, intellectuals, cultural and sports figures he interviewed and whose work he wrote. At the beginning of the 1960s, Aksentijevi\u0107 was the eyewitness of the end of the Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. His report from Congo in 1960, about the overthrow of Prime Minister Lumumba, was the first which spread the news around the world. Aksentijevi\u0107 was the last journalist, and perhaps the last man who talked with Lumumba before he was executed on 17 January 1961. Aksentijevi\u0107 was the first foreign journalist to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Palestinian bases in Jordan in 1968. Since then, he reported about the struggle of the Palestinian people for freedom from close proximity. He reported about the largest Arab-Israeli war in 1973. Although he was seriously wounded on the Syrmian Front in 1945, he always tried to be on the front line when he reported on the Middle East conflicts. He is the first Yugoslav journalist who met with Mustafa Barzani, a famous Kurdish leader and president of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Aksentijevi\u0107 organized and led the International Press Center in Belgrade from 1977 to 1982. In 1982, he became director of the Yugoslav Cultural Information Center in Vienna, Austria. This job was a special challenge in his career because he made it possible for him to become acquainted with the life of Serbian diaspora in Austria, as well as to promote Yugoslav culture in this country. Aksentijevi\u0107 was a co-founder of the Belgrade-based powerhouse Red Star Sports Association in 1945. Due to wounding during World War II, Aksentijevi\u0107 was not able to play basketball so he completely devoted himself to the club's work organization.

He worked initially at the Tengenenge Sculpture Community, 150 km north of Harare near Guruve, which he joined in 1966. Fanizani died on 5 February 2011. Fanizani Akuda, an ethnic Chewa was born in 1932 in what was then Northern Rhodesia. He received no formal schooling and in 1949 he moved to Southern Rhodesia in search of work. This led to employment as a cotton picker, bricklayer, and basket weaver: by 1966 he was working as a farm manager. However, in terms of his later success as a sculptor in stone, the most significant move came in that year when he was offered work by Tom Blomefield, a white South-African-born farmer of tobacco whose farm at Tengenenge near Guruve had extensive deposits of serpentine stone suitable for carving. Fanizani was initially a quarryman but after a period living in the artists\u2019 community he took up sculpting: finding this provided a worthwhile financial return, he became a full-time sculptor alongside other well-known figures such as Henry Munyaradzi. Akuda and his wife Erina had seven children. They had left Tengenenge in 1975 during the civil war, taking residence in Chitungwiza. After Zimbabwe\u2019s independence in 1980, Tengenenge Sculpture Community re-established itself as a major sculpting centre but Fanizani did not return there. He continued to sculpt independently until his death in 2011. In 1988, Fanizani\u2019s sculpture Snake Man was highly commended in the Zimbabwe Heritage Exhibition, the annual exhibition of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe.

In these stylised heads, the prototypical face with its slit eyes is given a thin mouth line with a simple centrally placed borehole. This gives the \u2018whistlers\u2019 an acoustic trait: by tapping a thumb on the sculpture\u2019s mouth, one can create a characteristic sound from the sculpture\u2019s lips. Olivier Sultan said of his work \"His characters are tender and humorous, constantly smiling, with mysterious slit eyes. They are often formed in pairs or groups.

Nicknamed \"The Emperor\", he played as a forward, and has been described as one of the most elegant footballers of all time. A club legend of Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC, Albert joined the team as a schoolboy and spent his whole playing career at Fradi. He also starred for Hungary, winning 75 international caps and scoring 31 goals. He was joint top-scorer at the 1962 World Cup with four goals and played a key role in Hungary's third-place finish at the European Championship in 1964. He stayed loyal to Ferencv\u00e1ros after his retirement as well, actively participated in the club's life and also held administrative positions. Since 2007 the stadium of Ferencv\u00e1ros bears his name. Albert died in October 2011, aged 70, in a hospital in Budapest after complications following heart surgery carried out a few days earlier. The son of a blacksmith, Albert was born and brought up in the little town of Hercegsz\u00e1nt\u00f3 near the border with the former Yugoslavia, where he got his first taste of the game playing with his two brothers. His mother was Hungarian Croat, from the group of \u0160okci. She died when he was 2. When the family later moved to Budapest, Albert participated on a talent day held by Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC. He impressed the coaches and was selected by the club. Albert was 11 years old at the time. Albert spent his entire club career with Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC, where he played from 1952 to 1974. He came through the ranks quickly and made his debut in the senior team on 2 November 1958 against Di\u00f3sgy\u0151r, in a match in which he hit the back of the net two times. The forward was also spotted by Hungarian national team manager Lajos Bar\u00f3ti in a youth match between Hungary and Yugoslavia, and not much later Albert already received his first call-up. His first appearance in the national selection came on 28 June 1959 against Sweden, who finished runners-up in the World Cup a year earlier. Albert contributed with two assist to Hungary's 3\u20132 win over the Scandinavians. He scored 31 goals in 75 caps for the Hungarian team, with them he has collected the bronze medal on both of the Olympic Games in 1960 and the European Championship in 1964. At the 1962 World Cup, despite Hungary being knocked out in the quarter-finals, Albert, tied with five others, managed to win the Golden Boot Award with four goals. On club level, his biggest success came in 1965, when in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Ferencv\u00e1ros, that knocked-out among others AS Roma and Manchester United F. C. en route to the final, triumphed over Juventus F. C. 1\u20130 in the decisive match and obtained the cup title. Albert appeared in his next World event in 1966 in England, where he produced an excellent display against Brazil in a duel that is regarded as one of the greatest matches in the history of the World Cup. The Magyars, after losing to Portugal in their first round encounter, entered a must-win match against Brazil. Hungary eventually beat the South Americans 3\u20131, to keep alive their hopes, and Albert, who received a standing ovation from the supporters, made the fans forget the absence of Pel\u00e9 with his performance. By winning their final group match, Hungary made it to the quarter-finals, just to fall short against the Soviet Union. The year 1967 was a special one for Albert, who not only won the Hungarian Championship with Ferencv\u00e1ros and collected the Hungarian Player of the Year title, but in December first celebrated the birth of his son, and later he was awarded the Ballon d'Or in recognition of his outstanding attributes. Albert topped the voting with 68 points, twenty-eight ahead of Bobby Charlton, who came second. In 1968 Albert appeared in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final again, this time against Leeds United, but lost by a one-goal margin (0\u20131). On 15 June 1969, in a World Cup qualifier against Denmark, Albert collided with Knud Engedal, goalkeeper of the Scandinavians, and suffered a serious fractured leg injury. Following that he was sidelined for almost a year and could never win back his form any more. Albert returned into action in the Hungarian Championship on 27 April 1970 against Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n and on 4 April 1971 he played his first international match after the injury, a friendly match against Austria. His final major event was the 1972 European Championship, where he captured fourth place with Hungary, recording two appearances in the tournament. In the same year he captured the Hungarian Cup title for the first time, thus making his collection of domestic silverware complete. Albert played his final league match on 17 March 1974 against Zalaegerszeg. He came on as a substitute in the second half and contributed to the 3\u20130 victory with a goal, the last one in his career. Albert, after receiving greetings and gifts from the old boys, the opponents and his son, ran to the stands, bowed for the fans and left the field on the shoulders of his teammates. Following his retirement, he had two short spells as a manager in Libya with Al-Ahly Benghazi, however, with only limited success. After returning from North Africa, Albert worked for Ferencv\u00e1ros in several positions, such as technical director, department leader and later honorary chairman. In 2007, Ferencv\u00e1ros' stadium was named after him. In the same year, he received a prize in his village of birth, Hercegsz\u00e1nt\u00f3, becoming an honorable citizen. In 2010 Budapest, a year later, Ferencv\u00e1ros awarded him honorary citizenship. Albert married Ir\u00e9n B\u00e1rsony, an actress, on 30 November 1963. The couple had two children, a girl, Magdolna, and a son, Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Albert Jr. , who, like his father, became a football player with Ferencv\u00e1ros, and later had spells in Israel and France and also played for the Hungarian national team. Albert's grandchild, Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Patrik, aims to become a professional footballer as well. On 27 October 2011, Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n, after suffering a vasoconstriction, underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Although a press release the following day by his former club Ferencv\u00e1ros stated that the operation had been successful, he subsequently suffered a heart attack and died in the early hours of 31 October 2011. His funeral took place on 6 November 2011 in the Cemetery of \u00d3buda. Hundreds of mourners accompanied Albert to his final rest, including Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Prime Minister of Hungary; P\u00e1l Schmitt, President of Hungary; S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi, president of the Hungarian Football Federation; G\u00e1bor Kubatov, president of Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC; and former teammates K\u00e1lm\u00e1n M\u00e9sz\u00f6ly, Gyula R\u00e1kosi, Lajos Sz\u0171cs and Tibor Nyilasi. The event was also live broadcast by Hungarian public television Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3. In the afternoon same day, Ferencv\u00e1ros played a league clash against Paksi SE. Before the match the floodlights were switched off and the stadium turned into dark, with candles lit by the fans are being the only lights in the arena. Ferencv\u00e1ros players wore a special all-black kit in the occasion and fans paid tribute to Albert with a banner saying \"God shall be with you Emperor\". Supporters of SK Rapid Wien, who have close ties with Ferencv\u00e1ros, also shown honor to Albert with a transparent in their game against SV Ried. The friendly match against Liechtenstein played on 11 November was declared a memorial game for Albert by the Hungarian Football Federation. The clash was originally scheduled to take place at the S\u00f3st\u00f3i Stadion, but later was moved to the Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s Stadium to give more people the opportunity to attend the event. In the four corners of the arena memorial places were erected, where the supporters could pay their tribute to the Golden Ball winner. A five-minute-long compilation of the best moments of Albert was also projected before the kick-off. Hungary eventually won the match 5\u20130 in front of a sold-out crowd with two goals by Bal\u00e1zs Dzsudzs\u00e1k, and further strikes from Tam\u00e1s Priskin, Vladimir Koman and R\u00f3bert Feczesin. Dzsudzs\u00e1k commented after the match that he is sure that Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n would have been happy if he could have seen the match, and added that he hopes they rejoiced him in Heaven.

One of Los Angeles' foremost trial advocates, Albert introduced several practices \u2013 such as the use of dummies and other tools in reconstructing incidents \u2013 familiar in current legal practice but virtually non-existent when he began his career. He was a pioneer in the development and use of biomechanical devices and modeling in major personal injury cases to explain the mechanical properties of the musculoskeletal system in relation to the physics and dynamics of collisions with cars, trains, and human beings involved in accidents. He was the lead trial attorney in \"bet the company\" cases for the Union Pacific Railroad, the Santa Fe Railroad, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, Swinerton Construction Co. , and the Regents of the University of California. Some of his more dramatic trials are recounted in Tales of the Rails: Railroad Claims Stories by Norman Udewitz. Albert was born on April 19, 1923 in New Haven, Connecticut. He and his brother were later abandoned by their mother at an Oakland, California orphanage. Left under the name of Merrill Smith, he picked apples at the Salvation Army Home for Boys during the Great Depression. He was placed in several foster homes until being permanently settled with the Tucker family of Oakland. After graduating at the top of his class from Oakland Technical High School in 1940, he attended the University of California, Berkeley. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, when Albert joined the United States Merchant Marine discovering upon entrance that \"Albert\" rather than Smith was his birth name. After becoming the youngest officer ever to obtain a Master's License in the Merchant Marine, Albert stopped sailing and returned to his studies at UC Berkeley. There he was elected president of his fraternity, Sigma Nu, and would become a two-time captain of the varsity tennis team. He made the team's \"All Star\" list for 1949-1951. After completing his undergraduate degree, Albert was admitted to UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, where he was subsequently published as the reviewing editor of the California Law Review. He graduated in 1955, the sixth in his class. In the three decades following his graduation from law school, Merrill Albert practiced law in Los Angeles, specializing in defending large corporations against a wide range of high-exposure personal injury and other \"bet the company\" lawsuits. It was during this time that Albert began using incident reconstructions during trials in order to demonstrate whether or not the plaintiffs' claims were physically possible. He was also a pioneer in the early use of biomechanical accident reconstruction dummies at trial. He tried over 300 cases, winning the vast majority of them, many against the foremost plaintiff's trial attorneys of the era. His courtroom tactics were likened by many of his contemporaries to those of the fictional Perry Mason, which reportedly more than once took their inspiration from Albert's actual trials. In 1990 Albert retired from the practice of law and devoted himself to the full-time enjoyment of opera, tennis, horse racing (he was a long-time member of the Santa Anita Park Turf Club), and various other pursuits. He also began writing, and his novel, The Big Casino, was published posthumously in 2003. The book has proved popular in Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India. It was followed in 2011 by the collection The Year 2012 Ushers in the Age of Fire and Other Short Stories, a series of tales centering on a coming apocalypse and a Polynesian tribe's attempts to prepare for it. At the time of his death Albert was at work on two other books. Adolf Hitler is Alive! \u2013 which postulates an enclave of Nazis who had escaped from Berlin to set up a secret society in the Antarctica to plot their revenge \u2013 and the Trinity of Life, a philosophical speculation on tripartite confluences in history, politics, and religion throughout human history \u2013 will be published posthumously.

His numerous works include the novel Caracol Beach. Alberto was nicknamed Lichi. Alberto was born in Arroyo Naranjo, Cuba, on September 10, 1951. His mother was Bella Garc\u00eda Marruz. His father, Eliseo Diego, was one of Cuba's best known poets and a member of a well known Havana-based family which included writers, screenwriters and musicians. Alberto's father often held tertulias, or gatherings of writers and other Cuban literary figures, at their home when he was growing up. He worked as a journalist, based in Havana. Alberto fled into exile in Mexico in 1990. The Cuban government had executed Arnaldo Ochoa and had begun to more strictly persecute writers and other intellectuals during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Nobel laureate Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez reportedly helped Alberto escape Cuba and find a new home in Mexico City. He became a Mexican citizen in 2000. Alberto never returned to Cuba and spoke of his experiences in exile, \"The worse thing about exile is that the places you inhabit don't remind you of anything . . . exile becomes your homeland. \"Alberto's novels often touched on the themes of Christian morality, including punishment, redemption and forgiveness. He focused much of his attention on characters living in his native city, Havana. Some of his novels set in Havana include La f\u00e1bula de Jos\u00e9 (Jos\u00e9's Fable) and La eternidad por fin comienza un lunes (Eternity Finally Begins on a Monday), about the life of a lion trainer, Tartufo, who grieves after the death of the lion, named Goldwyn Mayer. Although known as a novelist, Alberto was also a poet and screenwriter for films and television shows. He worked as a professor at film schools in Cuba, Mexico and the United States, including the Sundance Institute. His credits as a screenwriter included the film Guantanamera. A fierce critic of Cuba's Communist government, Alberto released a 1997 book criticizing Fidel Castro, entitled Informe contra mi mismo or Dossier Against Myself. In the 1997 book, Alberto revealed that the Cuban government had asked him to spy on his father's tertulias in 1978 while he was serving in the Cuban military. He was also asked to spy on Cuban exiles returning to the country. Alberto spoke about the book at the Miami Book Fair in 1997. He was awarded the Premio Alfaguara de Novela literary prize for Caracol Beach in 1998. The novel, perhaps his best known work, follows a war veteran living in a fictitious town in Florida who is haunted by visions of a Bengal tiger with wings. Caracol Beach was translated into English for publication in the United States. Eliseo Alberto died of complications from a kidney transplant, including heart and respiratory failure, in Mexico City on July 31, 2011, at the age of 59.

Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Albus received the B. S. degree in physics from Wheaton College, Illinois, in 1957 and the M. S. degree in electrical engineering from Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1958. In 1972 he received a Ph. D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park. From 1957 to 1973 Albus worked at NASA starting in 1957 as Physicist-Engineer on Project Vanguard at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC. From 1958 to 1969 he was Physicist-Engineer at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and from 1963 Acting Head of the Video Techniques Section. From 1969 to March 1973 he was head of the Cybernetics and Subsystems Development Section. In the 1960s he was associated with the early Vanguard satellite program and responsible for the optical aspect sensors on seven Goddard satellites, more than ten sounding rockets, and over 15 NASA spacecraft. From 1973 to 2008 Albus worked at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) which changed its name in 1980 to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). March 1973 to June 1980 he was Project Manager for Sensors and Computer Control Technology, NBS where he developed the Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) neural net model. From June 1980 to January 1981 he was leader of the Programmable Automation Group at the NBS and developed the RCS reference model architecture for the Automated Manufacturing Research Facility. From 1981 to 1996 he was chief of the Robot Systems Division at NIST. Here he founded the Robot Systems Division, developed the RoboCrane, and many applications of the RCS architecture for DARPA, NASA, ARL, U. S. Bureau of Mines, Ford, and General Motors. From 1995 to 1998 as Chief, Intelligent Systems Division, NIST he managed a Division of 35 professional scientists and engineers with an $8+ million per year budget. He developed the 4D/RCS architecture for the Army Research Lab (ARL) Demo III Experimental Unmanned Vehicle program. From 1998 to 2008 he was a Senior NIST Fellow, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Provided technical leadership to the Intelligent Systems Division and served as Principal Investigator for the implementation of intelligent ground vehicle projects funded by the Army and DARPA. From June 2008 to 2009 he was a Senior Fellow of the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Studies at George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, where he worked toward advancing the understanding of the computational and representational mechanisms of the human brain. From 2008 to 2011 he worked part-time at Robotic Technology Incorporated (RTI) and Robotic Research, LLC. He was a member of the editorial board of the Wiley Series on Intelligent Systems served on the editorial boards of six journals related to intelligent systems and robotics\" Autonomous Robots, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Journal of Robotic Systems, Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing. In 1962 he received the highest NASA cash award granted to that time for the invention of the Digital Solar Aspect Sensor. In 1984 he was winner of the Joseph F. Engelberger Award for robotics technology. He also received several other awards for his work in control theory including the NIST Applied Research Award, the Department of Commerce Gold and Silver Medals, the Industrial Research IR-100 award, the Presidential Rank Meritorious Executive, the Jacob Rabinow Award, and the Japan Industrial Robot Association R&D Award. Albus made contributions to cerebellar robotics, developed a two-handed manipulator system known as the Robocrane (a crane-like variation on the Stewart platform idea), and proposed an economic concept known as \"Peoples' Capitalism\". Peoples' Capitalism is similar to the ideas of Louis O. Kelso and discusses the question \"how would we live without jobs?\". Albus himself described the impact of his economic ideas as \"slight\". Albus's vision concerns included the following: a world without poverty, a world of prosperity, a world of opportunity, a world without pollution, a world without war, and includes a detailed plan for achievement of these goals. In 1971, he published a new theory of cerebellar function that modified and extended a previous theory published by David Marr in 1969. Based on his cerebellar model, Albus invented a new type of neural net computer, the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC), for which he received the IR-100 award from Industrial Research Magazine as one of the 100 most important industrial innovations of the year 1976. Albus invented and developed a new generation of robot cranes based on six cables and six winches configured as a Stewart platform. Albus co-invented the Real-Time Control System (RCS), a reference model architecture that has been used over the past 25 years for a number of intelligent systems including the NBS Automated Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF), the NASA telerobotic servicer, a DARPA Multiple Autonomous Undersea Vehicle project, a nuclear Submarine Operational Automation System, a Post Office General Mail facility, a Bureau of Mines automated mining system, a commercial open architecture machine tool controller, and numerous advanced robotic projects, including the Army Research Lab Demo III Experimental Unmanned Ground vehicle. During the 1980s, the Albus-Barbera reference model architecture (a. k. a. RCS - for Real-time Control System) provided the fundamental integrating principle of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) Automated Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF. ) This was an $80 million experimental automated factory-of-the-future. It was co-funded by the U. S. Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The success of the AMRF was largely responsible for the Congressional Legislation that transformed NBS into NIST. The 4D-RCS Reference Model Architecture is a reference model for military unmanned vehicles developed by the NIST, which describes how software components of military unmanned vehicles should be identified and organized. Albus has extended the reference model to a cognitive architecture for Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems. Albus (2009) described: This extended architecture is designed to enable any level of intelligent behavior, up to and including human levels of performance in driving vehicles and coordinating tactical behaviors between autonomous air, ground, and amphibious vehicle systems. It addresses the fundamental theoretical questions regarding whether computational processes are capable of emulating the functional processes in the brain, and provides a theoretical basis for understanding how the machinery of the brain generates the processes of the mind. Albus' work has led to a biologically plausible model of representation and computation in the human cortex. Albus has published more than 150 scientific papers, journal articles, and government studies on intelligent systems and robotics, and authored or coauthored six books: 1976.

He represented the riding of Winnipeg South in the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2006 and was a cabinet minister in the government of Prime Minister Paul Martin. Alcock was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Alcock was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Simon Fraser University and a Master's Degree in Public Administration from Harvard University. He was the director of Manitoba Child and Family Services from 1983 to 1985 and in this capacity spearheaded an effort to rewrite the province's child protection legislation. As a result of his efforts, Manitoba became the first province in Canada to introduce official protocols to deal with instances of child sex abuse. Alcock has also been active with the Harvard Policy Group, which studies the effects of Information Technology on the public sector. He began his political career at the provincial level, working as an organizer for the Manitoba Liberal Party in the early 1980s. Alcock was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the Winnipeg division of Osborne in the 1988 provincial election, in which the Manitoba Liberal Party rose from one seat to twenty under the leadership of Sharon Carstairs. He later worked as campaign manager for high-profile Liberal incumbent Lloyd Axworthy in the 1988 federal election. Alcock served as official opposition house leader and finance critic and was re-elected in the 1990 provincial election despite a shift against his party. He endorsed Jean Chr\u00e9tien's bid to lead the federal Liberal Party in 1990, and declared his own intention to enter federal politics in 1992. Alcock won the Liberal nomination for Winnipeg South in early 1993, defeating rival candidate Linda Asper by only five votes on the third ballot of what proved to be a divisive contest. He won a convincing victory over incumbent Progressive Conservative incumbent Dorothy Dobbie in the 1993 federal election and entered parliament as a government backbencher. Alcock soon developed a reputation as one of the most technologically savvy members of parliament. In 1994, he became the first MP to electronically coordinate his parliamentary office from his riding instead of relying on permanent staff in Ottawa. At around the same time, he became the first Canadian MP to host an official website. He was appointed to the standing committee on foreign affairs and international trade in 1995, and was named chair of the standing committee on transport in 1997. The Chr\u00e9tien government called a new federal election in the summer of 1997, only three-and-a-half years into its five-year mandate. The election timing was controversial in Manitoba, as it coincided with significant flooding from the Red River into Winnipeg. Alcock, along with other Manitoba Liberal MPs, requested a delay until the flooding was under control. When Chr\u00e9tien called the election anyway, Alcock transformed his campaign office into a volunteer relief centre. He was personally involved in sandbagging and evacuation efforts and did not actively campaign in the first period of the election. He was nonetheless returned by a significant margin. From 1998 to 2000, he served as parliamentary secretary to the President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. In 1998, he brought forward a private member's bill to overturn Louis Riel's conviction for high treason and recognize him as a Father of Confederation. There were frequent rumours that Alcock would be appointed to the Chr\u00e9tien cabinet, but he was passed over on more than one occasion. His professional relationship with Chr\u00e9tien deteriorated after 2000, and in 2002 he became the primary Manitoba organizer for Paul Martin's bid to replace Chr\u00e9tien as party leader. In the same year, he became one of the first Liberal MPs to openly call for Chr\u00e9tien's resignation. Alcock increased his public profile in 2003, after chairing a committee which forced privacy commissioner George Radwanski to resign from office after revelations of lax spending habits. When Paul Martin became Prime Minister of Canada on December 12, 2003, he appointed Alcock to cabinet as President of the Treasury Board, Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, and political minister responsible for Manitoba. He was also named to the government's priorities and planning committee, described as the \"inner circle\" of cabinet, and was appointed chair of a cabinet committee that conducted a comprehensive review of government spending. As president of the Treasury Board, Alcock was responsible for overseeing the Canadian civil service and the spending details of government agencies. He also played a leading role in coordinating the Martin government's response to the federal sponsorship scandal, in which some public monies were misappropriated by bureaucrats and advertising agents in Quebec with ties to the Liberal Party. Alcock announced a new appointment process for crown corporation executives in 2004, and the following year he issued a new policy of management control for government agencies. He argued that these reforms would prevent similar scandals from occurring in the future. One of his more notable initiatives was the establishment of a Chief Audit Executive for each government department and agency. In total, Alcock brought forward 158 separate reforms for the public service in late 2005, and promised that another eighty would follow. Critics considered this to be excessive and some suggested that Alcock was micro-managing his department. Alcock also released a comprehensive proposal for reforming Canada's regulatory system in March 2005. He argued that his reforms would reduce delays for patent drug approval and avoid the duplication of existing foreign research without compromising safety standards. Critics of the plan suggested that it could jeopardize Canadian sovereignty and lead to the adoption of American regulatory standards. In February 2004, the National Post identified Alcock as a leading cabinet supporter of private-public partnerships. In early 2005, Alcock publicly criticized his government's position against the legalization of marijuana, saying, \"If we actually wanted to break the back of organized crime, we would be better off to control it. When you have these things underground, what you end up fuelling is organized crime. \" Alcock was unexpectedly defeated in the 2006 federal election, losing to Conservative Rod Bruinooge by just 111 votes in Winnipeg South. He took personal responsibility for the loss and acknowledged that he did not spend enough time campaigning in his own riding. Alcock also said that being the government's point man for the sponsorship scandal did not help his electoral prospects, though he ultimately defended his government's actions. One of Alcock's final acts in office was to approve a payment of up to $40,000 to assist Jean Pelletier with legal fees in a court challenge against the Gomery Commission. Representatives of other parties criticized this payment, saying that the government should only cover legal costs for working civil servants. Pelletier's lawyer argued that it followed a long-standing government policy for high-ranking functionaries in judicial proceedings. In March 2006, Alcock announced that he would support Belinda Stronach if she entered the contest to succeed Paul Martin as Liberal leader. Stronach announced in early April that she would not be a candidate. Several of members of Alcock's political organization later worked for Ken Dryden's campaign, and Alcock himself endorsed Dryden at the leadership convention. Dryden dropped off after the second ballot and endorsed Bob Rae and then eventual winner St\u00e9phane Dion. In January 2007, Alcock was appointed to the faculty of the University of Manitoba as an executive in residence at the I. H. Asper School of Business. He was also appointed as a Research Affiliate with the Leadership Network at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. Alcock died on October 14, 2011, after suffering an apparent heart attack at James Richardson International Airport in Winnipeg. He was 63 years old. In September 2005, Alcock donated an original painting entitled, \"The view from my seat in the House of Commons, May 19, 6:10 p. m. \", to a charity auction in Winnipeg. The work, a parody of Edvard Munch's The Scream, depicted Alcock's impression of the opposition Conservative caucus moments after the Liberals won a crucial confidence vote that could have forced early elections. Alcock acknowledged that the painting was mostly traced. It sold for $2,200. Alcock suffered weight-related health problems during his political career. Facing the prospect of severe diabetes, he reduced his weight from 430 pounds to 295 pounds in the mid-2000s. All electoral information is taken from Elections Canada and Elections Manitoba.

Alcuaz was conferred the title of National Artist for Visual Arts, Painting, Sculpture and Mixed Media in 2009. However, four nominees for the award other than Alcuaz became embroiled in the 2009 National Artist of the Philippines Controversy, which led the Supreme Court of the Philippines to temporarily issue a status quo order on August 25, 2009, blocking the conferment of the awards on all seven nominees - despite the fact that no objections were ever raised regarding the conferment of the award to Alcuaz and two other nominees. Federico Aguilar Alcuaz was born on June 6, 1932 in Santa Cruz, Manila. He was the 6th of 11 Children of Mariano Aguilar a Lawyer and a Musician and Encarnneo de Manila]] and finished his degree in 1955. In 1949\u20131950 he took up painting subjects at the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts. In 1955 he went to [[rats.

She was married to the writer Ignacio Aldecoa, whose surname she adopted after his death for her own literary career. Josefina Aldecoa was the founder and Principal of Colegio Estilo from 1959 until her death in 2011. She died on 16 March 2011 in Cantabria, due to respiratory problems, aged 85. Josefina Aldecoa grew up in Le\u00f3n. There she became part of a literary group that produced the poetry magazine Espada\u00f1a. She moved to Madrid in 1944, where she studied Philosophy and Literature. She received her doctorate in pedagogy from the University of Madrid, focusing on a child's relationship to art. Her dissertation was later published as the book El arte del ni\u00f1o (1960). While studying she became connected to a group of writers later known as the Generation of '50: Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite, Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio, Alfonso Sastre, Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos, and Ignacio Aldecoa, whom she married in 1952. In 1959, she founded Colegio Estilo in Madrid, Spain. She came from a family of teachers. Her mother and grandmother practiced the ideology of the Instituci\u00f3n Libre de Ense\u00f1anza, an institution born at the end of the nineteenth century with the goal of renewing education in Spain. She lived in Le\u00f3n where she formed a part of a literary group that produced the poetry magazine Espada\u00f1a. She moved to Madrid in 1944. At the University of Madrid, she studied Philosophy and Literature and earned a PhD in Education on the relationship between infants and art. This thesis later was published under the title El arte del ni\u00f1o (1960). During her years of study, she came in contact with a group of writers that later formed part of the Generation of \u201850: Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite, Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio, Alfonso Sastre, Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos, and Ignacio Aldecoa, whom she married in 1952 and had one daughter with, Susana. She took Ignacio\u2019s surname, but only after she was widowed in 1969, leaving the R. of Rodr\u00edguez (Josefina R. Aldecoa). She translated for the newspaper Revista Espa\u00f1ola, directed by Ignacio Aldecoa, Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio, and Alfonso Sastre. In Madrid in 1959, she founded the Colegio Estilo, which for her was her greatest work, situated in the region of El Viso. She was inspired by the ideas poured out in her thesis on pedagogy, in the schools that she had visited in England and the United States and in the educational ideas of Krausism, formed the ideological base of the Instituci\u00f3n Libre de Ense\u00f1anza: \"I want something very humanist, giving much importance to literature, writing, art; a school that was very culturally refined, very free and not talk about religion, things that were then unthinkable in most of the centers of the country. \" In 1961 he published the collection of stories titled A ninguna parte. In Los ni\u00f1os de la guerra (1983) she chronicled her generation illustrated by portraits, biographies and literary commentaries on ten narrators which emerged in the 1950s. In 1969, her husband died and she abandoned her writing devoted to teaching, until 1981 when she published a critical edition of a selection of tales of Ignacio Aldecoa. She continued her literary career with novels like Los ni\u00f1os de la guerra (1983), La enredadera (1984), Porque eramos jovenes (1986) or El vergel (1988). In 1990, she began a trilogy of autobiographical content Historia de una maestra (1990), Mujeres de negro (1994) and La fuerza del destino (1997), partially in response to political discourse during the years after the dictatorship about how to rebuild the educational system, which she did not consider secular enough. In 1998, she wrote the essay Confesiones de una abuela, in which she addresses the relationships and experiences lived by her grandson. In 2000, she published Fiebre, an anthology of stories written between 1950 and 1990, and in 2002, El enigma, romance novel. In 2003, she won the Premio Castilla y Le\u00f3n de las Letras. In that same year, she published En la distancia, her memoirs. She not only reconstructs her memories, but also those of the last generation of Spanish intellectuals and writers of the Civil War and postwar: Ignacio Aldecoa, Luis Mart\u00edn-Santos, Juan Benet, Jesus Fernandez Santos, Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio, and Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite. It also reminds us of how she became a writer by accident, through an editorial assignment, of which she has no regret. The same as her travels abroad, which allowed herin a closed world flawed by the first Francoism. In 2005 she published La casa gris, a play she wrote when she was 24 years old where she narrates, in the form of a narrative through the protagonist, Teresa, her life in London reflecting on the differences in Spain and Europe in the 1950s. She published her last publication, Hermanas, in 2008 and died March 16, 2011 in Mazcuerras, Cantabria, from respiratory complications.

Alderson was born in Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire, and educated at Barnsley Technical College. In 1938 he enlisted in the Highland Light Infantry as a boy soldier and reached the rank of Corporal before transferring to the Army Physical Training Corps in 1941. He served with the APTC in North Africa and Italy and left the Army in 1946 with the rank of Warrant Officer Class II. He then joined the West Riding Constabulary as a Constable, representing the force in boxing and rugby. He attended the National Police College in 1954 and was promoted Inspector in 1955 (after the statutory minimum nine years' service) and Superintendent in 1960. In 1956 he was a British Memorial Foundation Fellow in Australia and that year he was also called to the bar by the Middle Temple. He attended the Senior Command Course at the Police College in 1963\u20131964 and was then appointed Deputy Chief Constable of Dorset. In 1966, he transferred to the Metropolitan Police in London as Deputy Commander (Administration and Operations) and in 1967 became second-in-command of No. 3 District (North-East London). In 1968 he became Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Training) and in 1970 was seconded as Commandant of the National Police College. In 1973 he returned to London as Assistant Commissioner \"D\" (Personnel and Training), but remained in the post less than a year before being appointed Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall in November 1973, where he remained until his retirement in May 1982. While Chief Constable he acquired a reputation for radical ideas which were not always popular with other senior police officers, who regarded him as \"soft\", and was also a champion of community policing. Alderson was frequently portrayed in the media as the polar opposite to James Anderton, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester from 1976 to 1991, who was seen as a champion of hardline, aggressive policing and a more punitive criminal justice system. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) in 1974 and appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1981. He became a Fellow Commoner of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and a fellow of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology in 1982 and was also Gwilym Gibbon Research Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford from 1982 to 1983. He was Visiting Professor of Police Studies at the University of Strathclyde from 1983 to 1989 and a research fellow at the Institute of Police and Criminological Studies at the University of Portsmouth from 1994 to 2000. He returned to Australia in 1987 as Australian Commonwealth Fellow with the Australian Government. He often commentated on police matters in the media. Alderson was a member of the Liberal Party and unsuccessfully contested the Devon parliamentary seat of Teignbridge in 1983. He served as a consultant on human rights to the Council of Europe from 1981 and was a member of the BBC General Advisory Council from 1971 to 1978. He also served on the committee of the Royal Humane Society from 1973 to 1981 and was president of the Royal Life-Saving Society from 1974 to 1978.

He also appeared in the television shows Damages as Uncle Pete and Ryan's Hope. He won a Daytime Emmy Award for playing the role of Shakespeare in Henry Winkler Meets William Shakespeare (1978). His last role was on the HBO series Boardwalk Empire, playing the father of Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi). Aldredge was born in Dayton, Ohio, the son of Lucienne Juliet (n\u00e9e Marcillat) and William Joseph Aldredge, a colonel in the United States Army Air Corps. He originally planned to become a lawyer and was a Pre-Law student at the University of Dayton in the late 1940s. In 1947 he decided to pursue a career as an actor after attending a performance of the original Broadway production of A Streetcar Named Desire. Aldredge carved out a respected career on the Broadway stage that spanned five decades, garnering five Tony Award nominations. He made his Broadway debut as Danny in the 1959 musical The Nervous Set. In 1972 he won a Drama Desk Award for his portrayal of Ozzie, the father of a blinded Vietnam veteran, in David Rabe's Sticks and Bones. He played Henry VIII's fool, Will Sommers, in Richard Rodgers' penultimate musical Rex in 1976. He originated the role of Norman Thayer Jr. in On Golden Pond in 1978, earning a Drama Desk Award nomination. His best-known role, however, was that of the Narrator/Mysterious Man in Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's Into The Woods, a role he later repeated in the PBS Great Performances production. He also created the role of the doctor in another Sondheim/Lapine collaboration, Passion. He was part of the 1997 all-star revival of Inherit the Wind produced by Tony Randall, playing Rev.

Alegr\u00eda Gallardo (April 14, 1921 \u2013 July 7, 2011) was a Puerto Rican scholar, cultural anthropologist and archeologist known as the \"father of modern Puerto Rican archaeology\". Ricardo Alegr\u00eda was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he received his primary and secondary education. His father, Jos\u00e9 S. Alegr\u00eda, was a former Vice President and founding member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. It was Alegr\u00eda's father who instilled him with a sense of love and pride for Puerto Rico, its history, and culture. In 1941 at the University of Puerto Rico, together with Yamil Galib, Alegr\u00eda founded a new fraternity, Alpha Beta Chi. In 1942, Alegr\u00eda earned his Bachelor of Science degree in archeology from the University of Puerto Rico. He continued his academic education in the University of Chicago where in 1947 he earned his master's in Anthropology and History. In 1954, Alegr\u00eda earned his Ph. D (doctorate) in Anthropology from Harvard University. Alegr\u00eda was named the first director of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture by Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, Puerto Rico's first elected governor. He was responsible for the creation of the \"Archaeological Center of Investigation of the University of Puerto Rico\"(UPR). Alegr\u00eda also created the \"Center of Popular Arts of the Puerto Rican Cultural Institute\", the program of publication of books of the institute, and created the logo for the Institute of Neurobiology in Puerto Rico. Alegr\u00eda was responsible for the renovation and restoration of historical Old San Juan under the leadership of then San Juan mayor Felisa Rinc\u00f3n de Gautier. He is also responsible for the restoration of the ruins of \"Caparra\" and \"Fort San Jeronimo\". As a result of his work \"Old San Juan\" was declared a \"Historical World Treasure\". In 1976, Alegr\u00eda opened the \"Center of Advanced Studies of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean\". In 1992, he established the \"Museum of the Americas\". Alegr\u00eda is considered a pioneer in the anthropologic studies of the Taino culture and the African heritage in Puerto Rico by the Smithsonian Institution. Caribbean Business points out that, \"His extensive studies have helped historians understand how the Ta\u00ednos lived and suffered, before and after the Spanish conquistadors arrived on the island. \" Alegr\u00eda estimated that about one third of all Puerto Ricans have Ta\u00edno blood\u2014results of recent DNA studies have proved him right. Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa became inspired by Alegr\u00eda's work and incorporated a fictional character based on him, named Ricardo Santurce, in his play El loco de los balcones. Ricardo Alegr\u00eda lived in Old San Juan in his later years, until his death on July 7, 2011. He had been hospitalized in San Juan's Centro Medico (Medical Center Hospital) a few weeks before his death. After a brief recovery, he relapsed, and was returned to the medical center, where he died of heart failure. In 1993, President Bill Clinton presented Alegr\u00eda with the \"Charles Frankel Prize\" for his contributions in the field of archaeology. In 1996, he was awarded the \"James Smithson Bicentennial Medal\". In 2001, Alegr\u00eda received from the hands of Nancy Morejon \"The Haydee Santamaria Medal\" in Havana, Cuba. In 2002, Alegr\u00eda received the \"Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn Medal\" in recognition of his life achievements from Puerto Rican Governor Sila Calder\u00f3n. Puerto Rican artist Lorenzo Homar honored Alegr\u00eda by making an artistic graphic poster of him. Alegr\u00eda also received recognition from cultural and architectural organizations in Peru, Venezuela, Mexico and the Dominican Republic, where he also received an honorary doctorate. The city of Havana recognized his influence in the project to remodel the city's historical district (similar to Alegr\u00eda's work in Old San Juan) by honoring him with a plaque, which, while he was alive, was the only monument honoring a living Puerto Rican in the entire city. Puerto Rican folk duo Los Ni\u00f1os Estelares dedicated a tribute song to Alegr\u00eda, named \"Alegr\u00eda, Doctor Alegr\u00eda\", in their 2010 album, Namast\u00e9. In it they describe many of Alegr\u00eda's accomplishments, his educational background, and -partly in jest, due to Alegr\u00eda's impressive credentials- likened him to Indiana Jones. In the lyrics, they name Alegr\u00eda \"the last Puerto Rican hero. \" The following is a list of books which Alegr\u00eda has either authored or co-authored.

He headed the company\u2019s legal department and represented Mikhail Khodorkovsky when the Kremlin accused the oil tycoon and his managers of money laundering and embezzlement in 2006. Aleksanyan was arrested and charged as an accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering. After refusing to allegedly provide false evidence against other Yukos executives, he served two years in prison while suffering from advanced cancer and AIDS. After a decision by European Court of Human Rights, he was released on a bond on 12 January 2009, dying from complications of AIDS on 2 October 2011. Vasily Aleksanyan graduated from Moscow State University and the Law School of Harvard University as a Master of Laws. In 1992 through 1994 he worked for the USA law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. In 1995\u20131996 he was the head of the legal department for the British Investment firm SUN Group. Since 1996 he worked as the head of the legal department for Yukos. On 1 April 2006, amidst the legal troubles over Yukos company, his position was elevated to that of Executive Vice President. His new position was accepted by the shareholders on 4 April. His main stated goal in the new role was to streamline the corporate governance, achieving direct control over the assets of the company from the London Yukos headquarters bypassing the Moscow based offices of Yukos RM and Yukos EP. The decision was quite important for the struggling company as the Moscow-based offices bluntly refused all the supervision from London obeying orders of the government-controlled Rosneft instead. According to Aleksanyan, the lost control over the Moscow offices led to financial irregularities, including e. g. surfacing of counterfeit 10 billion ruble promissory note. On 6 April 2006 Aleksanyan was taken into custody as a suspected accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering by Yukos. According to prosecutors, Aleksanyan was an accomplice to the embezzlement of more than 12 billion rubles. The arrest was based on the testimonies of Svetlana Bakhmina, a subordinate of Aleksanyan arrested in 2004. According to Aleksanyan, Bakhmina's testimonies were false, and were taken from her under pressure. After his arrest Aleksanyan started a hunger strike, insisting that his arrest without court hearings was illegal. He aborted his strike on 27 April 2006. During Aleksanyan's imprisonment, his health rapidly deteriorated due to HIV-related illnesses. He became almost blind and developed cancer of the liver with metastasis into the lymph nodes. He also became ill with tuberculosis. Despite the grave medical situation demanding urgent antiretroviral treatment and chemotherapy in a hospital, he was denied both. The prosecutors also ignored three injunctions by the European Court of Human Rights on 27 November 2007, on 6 December 2007 and on 20 December 2007. According to Aleksanyan, the prosecutors are demanding false evidence against other Yukos executives from him before starting his medical treatment. On 26 December Aleksanyan made public a statement asking for help from human rights advocates. Eleven days into a hunger strike in his favour by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Aleksanyan was transferred from a pre-trial prison to an oncological hospital on 8 February 2008. On 20 October 2008 Simonovsky Court of Moscow approved continuing pre-trial detention of Alexanyan despite his grave illnesses (he had cancer, tuberculosis and AIDS and his spleen was surgically removed). On 8 December 2008 Moscow City Court reversed the decision of Simonovsky Court and decided to release Alexanyan under a bond of 50 million rubles (approximately $2 million). He was to be released after the money was paid. Human rights advocates Lev Ponomaryov and Lyudmila Alexeyeva welcomed the court decision but expressed concern whether Alexanyan would be able to pay this sum of money. On 22 December 2008 European Court of Human Rights made its decision over the Aleksanyan v. Russia case. The court found Russia in violation of four articles of European Convention on Human Rights and obliged Russia to release Alexanyan immediately without any bond. On 12 January 2009, after a bond of 50 million rubles was paid, Aleksanyan was released. But he was repeatedly summoned to attend court hearings, where he wore a face mask and could barely stand up during the proceedings. The case against him was only dropped last year as the statute of limitations ran out. Aleksanyan died at his home in Moscow on 2 October 2011, due to complications from AIDS.

He set 80 world records and 81 Soviet records in weightlifting and won gold medals at the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics. At the age of 18, Alekseyev began practicing weightlifting at Trud Voluntary Sports Society, trained by his coach Rudolf Plyukfelder until 1968, when he began to train solo. He was not a naturally large man like other super heavyweights but was encouraged to gain strength by adding weight. In January 1970 Alekseyev set his first world record, and during the World Weightlifting Championship in Columbus, Ohio in 1970 he was the first man to clean and jerk 500 pounds (227 kg) in competition. During one of his early world records, Oscar State OBE remarked that the weight of over 460 pounds (209 kg) in the Olympic press looked so easy it could have been a broomstick. This was the beginning of a series of 80 world records Alekseyev set between 1970 and 1977. He received bonus funds every time he set a world record by the Soviet Union; so he made it a point to gradually increase his world records by 1. 1 pounds or 0. 5 kg. He was unbeaten and held the World Championship and European Championship titles for those eight years. He was the first man to total over 600 kg in the triple event. Many thought he would be the first to clean and jerk the mythical 600 pounds but it was never to be as his habit of increasing world records by only 1/2 kilo took so long that age caught up to him. Alekseyev's performance in the Moscow Olympics of 1980 was a disappointment. He had by then become more of a recluse, training by himself without a coach. In the snatch he set his opening weight too high and was unable to lift it, scoring zero kilograms as the result. He retired from weightlifting after the Moscow Olympics. In 1987, Alekseyev was elected to represent the Ryazan District for the Soviet Union's Congress of People's Deputies. Alekseyev worked as a coach between 1990 and 1992. Under his leadership, the Unified Team earned ten medals in weightlifting at the 1992 Summer Olympics, including five golds. From 1966 Alekseyev lived in Shakhty, where in 1971 he graduated from the branch of the Novocherkassk Polytechnical Institute. He died on 25 November 2011 in Germany in a clinic where he had been sent for serious heart problems. He was 69. The Russian Weightlifting Federation reported his death and called him a \"Soviet sports legend\" and \"one of the strongest people in the world\". He was survived by wife Olimpiada and sons Sergey and Dmitry. Dmitry competed nationally in weightlifting, placing fourth at the 1988 Soviet weightlifting championships. Vladimir Vysotsky devoted his \"Song about weightlifter\" (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043e \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435, 1971) to Alekseyev. Alekseyev was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated 14 April 1975, titled \"World's Strongest Man. \" In 1999, in Greece, Alekseyev was acknowledged as the best sportsman of the 20th century. He was also awarded: Order of Lenin (1972), Order of Friendship of Peoples, Order of the Badge of Honour (1970), and Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1972). In 1993, he was elected a member of the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame. In Shakhty, where he lived much of his life, there is a street and park named after him, as well as his monument installed in 2014. Snatch: 190. 0 kg (419 lbs) on 1 September 1977 in Podolsk; Clean and press: 236. 5 kg (521 lbs) on 15 April 1972 in Tallinn; Clean and jerk: 256. 0 kg (564 lbs) on 1 November 1977 in Moscow; Total: 645. 0 kg (clean and press + snatch + clean and jerk), on 15 April 1972 in Tallinn, the official world record total in 1972; Total: 445. 0 kg (snatch + clean and jerk) in Podolsk.

Dragutin Aleksi\u0107 was a famous Serbian na\u00efve and marginal art sculptor. He was born in Sladaja near Despotovac (Serbia) in 1947. He began doing sculpture in 1968. He died in Sladaja, near Despotovac (Serbia) in 2011. His preoccupation with existential problems of farmers, highlanders, miners is visible in the structures of extraordinary expressive force, achieved by a specific manner of procession, more with forceful cuts in the wood by an axe than by a sculptor\u2019s chisel. Led by a strong instinct and robust character, he processed the wood rustically, transmitting his raw energy into a wooden mass, emphasizing a predominant force of a man \u2013 highlander, who seizes from the nature in his fight for survival. In his sculptures with multiplied figures, central figures or events are rare. While doing sculpture Aleksi\u0107 liberates a thought, not a tale, hence the intensity of expression is most pronounced in the mere procedure of cutting, quick and capricious, in order to make his idea visible as soon as possible. With deeper, abrupt, unexpected incision in wood he creates dynamic light effects in which the dance of light and shadow provides an additional dynamics to the whole work. He is an artist of action and instinct without pictorial deliberation. Therefore, his idea is raw, uncultivated, but direct, suggestive, sometimes schematically given but intensive and complete. From whole mass of monumental logs, heads and busts emerge, rarely whole human and animal figures and vegetation. In sculptural treatment, Dragutin Aleksi\u0107\u2019s work has a touch of art brut, or more precisely, is on the borderline between na\u00efve art and art brut.

In business from a young age, Alencar became a self-made multimillionaire as the chief executive of Coteminas, a leading textile manufacturer. In the 1990s, Alencar groomed his son to succeed him at the company. He opted to enter politics in his home state, Minas Gerais. Alencar had a business-oriented political platform, advocating market liberalization and deregulation of production. His expensive political campaigns received hefty funds from Coteminas. After a failed run in 1994 for governor of Minas Gerais, he won the election in 1998 as Senator representing his home state. In 2002, Alencar was invited by the left-wing Workers' Party to run for Vice President on the same ticket as Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. The alliance between the leftist union leader and Alencar, an experienced entrepreneur, proved successful. They won the presidential elections in 2002 and were re-elected in 2006. Over the years, Lula da Silva and Alencar developed a close and affectionate friendship. Diagnosed with cancer of the stomach and kidney in 1997, Alencar died of the disease in 2011. Alencar came to be revered among journalists and politicians for his spirited personality and friendly demeanor. He overcame his lack of formal education. Based on his business success, he argued in favor of lower taxes, especially indirect taxation over consumers, and a simpler tax system; lower interest rates and greater oversight of the banking industry; and social welfare and assistance programs. As Vice President, Alencar sometimes spoke out against his own government's orthodox policies, causing embarrassment for fellow administration members. His unwavering determination to live in the face of terminal cancer also marked public perception, during and after his time in office. Alencar was born into a family of small entrepreneurs from Muria\u00e9, in the inland state of Minas Gerais on 17 October 1931. He was the eleventh son of Ant\u00f4nio Gomes da Silva and Dolores Peres Gomes da Silva. As a child, he was a Boy Scout. He started working while still a child, dropping out of primary school to help his father in the family business. He worked with his older brothers for years before becoming an independent successful businessman. For a time he worked as a travelling salesman and in food wholesale start-ups. After getting established, Alencar married Mariza Gomes in 1957. They had three children together. Their two daughters are Maria da Gra\u00e7a and Patr\u00edcia. Their son Josu\u00e9 took over the presidency of Coteminas after his father went into politics. As a result of a case filed by Rosemary de Morais, a 55-year-old retired teacher, in July 2010 the court ruled that Alencar needed to recognize her as his daughter. (The case may be appealed. ) He had refused to undergo DNA testing but, according to Brazilian law 12. 004/2009, this refusal is accepted as evidence of paternity. In addition, the judge ruled that other evidence in the case led him to his decision. Rosemary de Morais said she was the child of Francisca de Morais, a nurse, and Alencar, from a relationship they had in 1954, before either was married. The legal case over Morais' parentage is still ongoing, as there are some appeal rights. Alencar eventually turned his family's small clothes factory and retail store into a major business. In 1967, he founded Coteminas, which he would lead to become one of Brazil's largest textile manufacturers. He produced goods for traditional brands in its portfolio, such as Artex, Santista and Calfat. He vied for dominance of the global market after a merger with South Carolina-based Springs Industries. After decades as a businessman, Alencar decided to enter politics and prepared his son to take over his leadership of Coteminas. He ran for governor of Minas Gerais in 1994. Although he was not successful, in 1998 he was elected as Senator from Minas Gerais. While in the Senate, Alencar worked on several Commissions, including the Senatorial Commission for Economic and Social Matters. In 2002, he left the presidency of his company, by then a leading player with roughly 850 million reais in yearly net sales, to his son Josu\u00e9 Gomes da Silva. Alencar ran for Vice President of Brazil, tapped to be Lula's running mate, to assuage worries about the candidate's alleged anti-business bias. He became the honorary President of the center-right Liberal Party. At the end of 2005, Alencar left his party to associate with the new Brazilian Republican Party, whose founders included Bishop Marcelo Crivella of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, a large and growing evangelical church in Brazil and other countries. Crivella is also a Senator representing Rio de Janeiro in the federal government. In office, Alencar aligned with another successful businessman in the cabinet, Luiz Fernando Furlan, to channel the demands of Brazilian businessmen. They voiced discontent with bureaucracy, insufficient infrastructure and cautious monetary policy. His efforts led to the strengthening of Apex-Brasil, a pro-export agency seen as instrumental in the Brazilian economy's recent rise in exports. Alencar was the most notable person in government to openly complain of the conservative monetary policies of the Brazilian Central Bank, under Henrique Meirelles, backed by ministers Antonio Palocci and Paulo Bernardo. He often criticized his own administration for failing to lower the Central Bank's base interest rates and demanded a reform of the country's tax system. In November 2004 he was sworn in as Defense Minister, following the resignation of Jos\u00e9 Viegas Filho. Lula turned to him to occupy the position. Alencar tried to resign on several occasions, claiming that a businessman would hardly be the best choice for running a nation's military forces. President Lula convinced him to stay until March 2006, when Alencar resigned his ministerial post, in favor of anti-graft activist Waldir Pires. Despite his disagreements with some policies of the Lula administration, Alencar was officially invited by Lula to be his running mate in the 2006 general elections. With Lula's re-election victory on 29 October, Alencar secured his position as Vice President for another term. Alencar adopted a lower tone, while still espousing his traditional positions. He sought to run for the Senate in 2010, but was forced to give up due to the advanced stage of his cancer disease. On a routine check-up, Jos\u00e9 Alencar was diagnosed with stomach and kidney cancer in 1997. After undergoing treatment for some length of time, he had his right kidney and two-thirds of his stomach surgically removed. Five years later, a malignant tumor in his prostate was removed. As the disease had metastasized, it continued to spread, and in 2006 doctors discovered a sarcoma in his abdomen. On 26 January 2009, a surgery extirpated eight tumors, along with compromised portions of his small and large intestines and the ureters. He was treated for digestive hemorrhage in December 2010 with urgent surgery, his last as Vice President. Doctors could not remove the tumors in his abdomen because of the number of operations to which he had already been subjected \u2013 eighteen in all. Alencar received chemotherapy for many years. He was mostly treated at Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, in S\u00e3o Paulo. He also received experimental treatment at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. Alencar died in late March 2011, in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, after 13 years battling metastasized cancer. His death was met with expressions of grief and respect by members of different institutions and across the political spectrum \u2013 former President Lula said he knew \"few men with Jos\u00e9 Alencar's goodness and spirit\" and President Rousseff said it was an \"honor\" to have served alongside him. Brazil held a state funeral for Jos\u00e9 Alencar, and Vice President Michel Temer decreed seven days of official mourning. Alencar is remembered as an honest and independent politician who favored social welfare and economic freedom.

"}, {"text": "Franz Copeland Murray Alexander OD (2 November 1928 \u2013 16 April 2011), known as Gerry Alexander, was a Jamaican cricketer who played 25 Test matches for the West Indies. He was a wicket-keeper who had 90 dismissals in his 25 Test appearances and, though his batting average was around 30 in both Test and first class cricket, his only first-class century came in a Test on the 1960\u201361 tour of Australia. Alexander was the last white man to captain the West Indies cricket team. He led the West Indies against Pakistan at home in 1958, on the tour of India and Pakistan in 1958\u201359 and against England in 1960. He would not tolerate the indiscipline of Roy Gilchrist on the tour of India and sent him home before the team reached Pakistan. He was educated at Wolmer\u2019s Boys' School, which was founded in 1729 and is one of the oldest schools in the West Indies. He then attended Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He played for the Cambridge cricket team in both 1952 and 1953, winning a Blue in both years for appearing in the University Match against Oxford. He also won a Blue at football, and went on to win an England amateur cap and an FA Amateur Cup winner\u2019s medal in 1953 playing for Pegasus. He played cricket for Cambridgeshire in 1954 and 1955. He represented Great Britain at football in 1956 in a qualifying game versus Bulgaria on 12 May 1956 at Wembley. The match ended 3-3. Having not played a first-class match since 1953, he appeared for Jamaica in two matches against the touring Duke of Norfolk's XI in March 1957. He also appeared in a trial match for the West Indies tour to England that summer, sharing a stand of 134 with Wes Hall. As a result he was chosen as wicketkeeper for the touring team, though his selection was controversial. He only appeared in the final two Tests of that series, Rohan Kanhai being preferred as a makeshift keeper for the first three. Alexander distinguished himself in neither match, scoring 0 not out, 11, 0 and 0 and not keeping well, and West Indies lost both matches by an innings. After the series John Goddard, the captain, retired. For the first time it seemed possible that a black captain would be appointed as his replacement. However Frank Worrell declined the position because he was studying for a degree in economics at Manchester University, and the other senior players Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott were apparently not considered suitable. Thus Alexander was offered the job and, as his Telegraph obituarist writes \"through patience, skill and encouragement. . . succeeded in forging the array of talent in the West Indies side into a coherent and successful team. \"In his first series as captain, in 1958, West Indies won at home by three matches to one against Pakistan. He also performed better both as batsman and keeper, including playing an important innings of 57 in the second innings of the second Test. \"West Indies next toured India and Pakistan. For the first time since World War II they had to manage without any of the \u201cthree Ws\u201d who had been the core of their batting: Worrell, Weekes and Walcott. Nevertheless they won three Tests against India and drew the remaining two. On the only occasion that they were in difficulties, against the leg-spin of Subhash Gupte in the second Test, Alexander scored 70 to save the day. \"Against North Zone in the last match of the Indian leg of the tour, Roy Gilchrist, who in earlier matches had already shown a tendency to bowl beamers when angry or frustrated, unleashed a barrage of such deliveries against Swaranjit Singh, whom Alexander had known at Cambridge. Gilchrist ignored his captain's instruction to cease this form of attack. During the lunch interval Alexander substituted Gilchrist. Subsequently Gilchrist was sent home, while the other players proceeded to Pakistan for the remainder of the tour. Alexander told Gilchrist: \u201cYou will leave by the next flight. Good afternoon. \u201d This was the end of Gilchrist's Test career. There were suggestions that he had pulled a knife on Alexander. West Indies lost their first two Tests against Pakistan but won the third, Pakistan's first home defeat. The following winter, West Indies lost by one Test to nil against England, with four matches drawn, under Alexander's captaincy. He had the consolation of finishing the series with 23 victims as wicketkeeper, equalling John Waite\u2019s world record. The West Indies lost heavily in the second Test in Trinidad, and the crowd rioted when they collapsed in their first innings. As a white man and a Jamaican, Alexander was an unpopular figure with the Trinidad crowd. Frank Worrell's return to the West Indies team for that series encouraged CLR James, the editor of The Nation, to campaign for him to replace Alexander as captain, and Worrell was chosen to lead the tour to Australia the following winter. Alexander took the decision well, and was supportive of Worrell, who was a close friend. According to his obituarist: \"The dismissed captain had taken over a side in total disarray and laid the foundations for future triumphs. \"He had a remarkably successful tour of Australia with the bat, scoring 60, 5, 5, 72, 0, 108, 63, 87 not out, 11 and 73 in the Tests. His century at Sydney was an important factor in enabling West Indies to win, and was the only one of his first-class career. He also kept wicket well. At the end of the tour he retired from cricket. After retiring as a cricketer he returned to the West Indies, where he pursued a career as a veterinary surgeon. He eventually became Chief Veterinary Officer. In 1982 Jamaica awarded him the Order of Distinction for his contribution to sport. He died on 16 April 2011 at the age of 82 in Orange Grove, Jamaica. His wife Barbara had died only four weeks previously; they had two children.

Alexandra was born in Bucharest, Romania. From 1965 to 1971, she studied at the Ciprian Porumbescu Conservatory (now the National University of Music Bucharest) under Tudor Ciortea and Tiberiu Olah and took composition courses in 1974, 1978, 1980 and 1984 in Darmstadt, Germany. She had a doctorate in musicology and taught composition, orchestration, and music analysis at the Conservatory from 1971 until her death in 2011. A prolific composer in the neoromantic style, Alexandra had over 100 of her works performed and published in Romania. According to musicologist Octavian Cosma, she was \"in her element with orchestral and chamber music, employing repetitive and evolving techniques, with melodic lines which suggest lyricism and meditation\" and an instrumentation that used \"a palette of delicate, pastel colours. \" Alexandra married the Romanian cellist and composer \u015eerban Nichifor in 1978. They performed together as Duo Intermedia from 1990 and were co-directors of the Nuova Musica Consonante - Living Music Foundation Festival. Liana Alexandra died at her home in Bucharest of a cerebral hemorrage at the age of 63. On 12 January 2011, two days after her death, the broadcast Univers muzical rom\u00e2nesc on Radio Rom\u00e2nia Muzical was dedicated to her. In May of that year, Liana Alexandra: Marturii despre muzica ei (Liana Alexandra: Confessions about her Music) was published by Editura Stephanus in a bilingual Romanian and English edition. Edited by \u015eerban Nichifor, the book is an anthology of writings on Alexandra's music by composers, critics and musicologists including Viorel Cosma, Grete Tartler, Robert Voisey, and Jacques Leduc. Later that month, her 1987 opera \u00cen labirint (The Maze) was performed in her memory by the Banatul Philharmonic of Timi\u0219oara as the closing concert of the Timi\u0219oara International Music Festival (31 May 2011).

He exhibited his work at personal exhibitions and group events both in Greece and abroad. Alexiou lived in central Athens until his death from cancer at the age of 51. In 1982, at the age of 22, Alexiou moved to Austria to study at the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts. Two years later, he returned to Greece to study at the Athens School of Fine Arts. Alexiou received recognition for his work as set designer for Medea (Dimitris Papaioannou, (1993) and for The End (installation, 2007). The End was selected as the Greek contribution to the 52nd Venice Biennale. 23rd Biennale of Alexandria, 2005. Outlook and the Athens by Art exhibitions, 2004 Athens Olympic Games and 2004 Cultural Olympiad Breakthrough! Greece 2004, Madrid Free Transit, Spain, 2003, Zappeion, Greek Presidency of the EU. Deste Prize, 2003 (Deste foundation, Greece) In 1985, Alexiou held his first personal exhibition at \"Desmos\" Gallery in Athens. He used basic materials and those commonly found in nature such as rock, wood, mud and water. In 1987, Alexiou continued his experimentation with natural features by venturing into their decomposition. He created Prisms, a series of works which analyzes the projection of white light into different spaces, even through rain. Alexiou later created Solar Houses, minimalistic constructions of cane and reeds which share a fragile feeling of absolute geometry. Alexiou said, he was creating \"an imaginable garden pavilion\". Other works in this genre include: San Marco di Venezia, The Gate, and Fountain. In 2007, Vassilika Sarilaki, an art historian, interviewed Alexiou regarding his participation in the Venice Biennale. She wrote, \"A master of space and the sense of the borderline, Nikos Alexiou, an artist known for his delicate works and motifs, his paper embroidered with perforations and his frugal constructions, will be representing Greece at this year\u2019s Venice biennale. \" \"The title of this year\u2019s biennale, (2007) which will be held between June 10 and mid November, is \u201cThink with the senses -- feel with the mind. Art in the present tense\u201d, and, Nikos Alexiou\u2019s sensuous installation seems to get to the very heart of the matter. Starting out with the wonderful motifs in the floor mosaics of the Oberon monastery, which he reproduces in endlessly varying colours and designs to articulate an ecstatic world of beauty and moderation. His is a \u2018structured chaos\u2019 which balances the geometric nature of the material with the spontaneity of gesture. \" \"Alexiou\u2019s work emerges once more not as a product of a prefabricated idea, but as the source of an all-embracing gift to the beauty of forms. As a product and an engagement of his bodily devotion to it. And it is this which ultimately bestows a natural grace and an aura of redemption on the work. \" \"Alexiou means tradition in the sense ascribed to it by Husserl. That \u201cpainting\u2019s past creates a tradition in the artist, a duty to start over differently; not survival, which is the hypocritical form of forgetfulness, but effectual reclamation, which is a noble form of memory. \u201d It is this \u201creclamation of memory\u201d through the experience of familiarity that he attempts to convey today, though he allows the viewer to see the work unfettered and to lose themselves in the ecstasy of the small, psychedelic world it proposes; a world dotted with coloured motifs which flow in space, with tender sketches of the monastery and intricate digital labyrinths on video. \" \"Taken together, the recollective designs, the fragmentary motifs moving imperceptibly on video, constantly changing shape, and the intricate patterns suspended in mid air define a new aesthetic world open to the imagination, to experience, to the viewer\u2019s \u201cindividual breath\u201d, and in so doing render largely relative the classical view of stability and the objectivity of space. Meaning the guise of material crops up again and again as a concept in Alexiou\u2019s work as a pretext for taking a fresh look at our inner world and the way it is naturally reflected on the outside. And this might ultimately be art\u2019s prime subject. \"\"What will the installation you will be showing at the Venice biennale include exactly, and how will it be structured?\"\"The work functions as a theatrical machine. Because the way it is set up \u2018plays\u2019 with the viewer. Inside its gate, there is a large screen with a video projected on it which invites the viewer to proceed further in, essentially to wander around on \u2018stage\u2019, into the heart of the machine. Meaning the viewer doesn\u2019t watch from outside; he enters something that surrounds him on all sides. Behind the screen, there is a series of intricate hanging \u2018embroideries\u2019 which mirror the banners with different designs from the Iveron monastery. \"\"What was it that moved you about this particular floor from the Iveron monastery? Were you just interested in its form, or were your personal experiences your starting point, given that you\u2019ve been visiting the monastery since 1995?\"\"These things are strange, as you know. You come into contact with something and you don\u2019t know what it is that moves you. . . It could have been something else. But this floor was in the very centre of the church, and living in the monastery you would cross it several times a day. So the reasons I chose it were related to my experiences of it, and with my familiarity with it. \"\"But as I can see from the video, in a sense these designs function as a pretext for a 'meditative loss'\". . . \"Yes, they do. Meaning that what I do is lay all these lines out in a place in a \u2018give \u2018em all you\u2019ve got\u2019 sort of way. But see how nice it is. . . enjoy it. It\u2019s a trip; isn\u2019t that what they say. \"\"It really is delightful. It reminds me of Arabic motifs. . . \"\"You\u2019re pretty far off the mark there. These are Greek motifs; we\u2019ve had them since 300 BC. They\u2019re designs you grow up with. \"\"Why did you entitle the work \u201cThe end\u201d?\"\"I was referencing a wonderful text by Beckett with that title which really suited the work. \"\"Which part of it?\"\"Well, this design, these lines are on a knife-edge, a frontier. They are birth and death at once. Which is something Beckett\u2019s text exudes, too. Which is why whether it\u2019s a screen or a \u2018curtain\u2019 or a piece of paper, it\u2019s always inscribed in one dimension. One level. It\u2019s the beginning and the end together. . . Because the \u201cEnd\u201d here reminds me of the title descending the screen at the end of a film. And it\u2019s a state of ecstasy that arises from the \u2018reality\u2019 of the work. It\u2019s a trance. \"\"And how do this state, these images, differ from pop art?\"\"It is pop art. This video we\u2019re watching now, for instance, is playing around with the Sixties. . . \"\"And with psychedelia?\"\"Yes. \"\"Fine, but someone might wonder \u201cHey, how can he combine the floor from the Iveron monastery, which has its own particular experiences, octagonal cosmological symbols, mandalas, meditation and so on with a neo-pop or psychedelic idiom?\"\"And what\u2019s neo-pop? Exactly that. . . Jimmy Hendrix and Our Father who art in Heaven. \"\"Apart from the obvious, is there any sort of concealment here? In your perforated curtains, for instance, through whose delicate fabric one sees and does not see?\"\"There is the allure of the knife-edge again, of translucence in 2 dimensions. \"\"Meaning you\u2019re primarily interested in the surface. Does your work have a symbolic dimension?\"\"Yes. Anyone can find any symbol they like in there. Meaning you see something and say: \u201cAh, that\u2019s a garden\u201d or a universal symbol. It\u2019s whatever you see. \"\"I asked you if your work was related this time to symbols because these patterns are joined together into mandalas, which are cosmic symbols, but also because the masters of abstraction\u2014Mondrian, Kandinsky, Malevich, Kupka, Itten\u2014were closely bound up with the metaphysical and its symbolism. And that\u2019s no accident. . . \"\"Metaphysical. . . Can\u2019t we just say physical? That\u2019s what I call it. \"\"I\u2019m not using \u2018metaphysical\u2019 in the sense of \u2018non-real\u2019 or to convey a suspicious or negative connotation. It's just that the geometric form is a symbol in itself. In this sense, it produces specific senses and ideas. For instance, there were the theosophical views of Mondrian, who defined the vertical as spirit and the horizontal as material, or the \u201cspiritual component\u201d of colours and shapes and what Kandinsky or Itten defined as geometrical harmony. That's what I'm talking about. Do the traditional, archetypal motifs you use reference symbolisms, or not?\"\"I\u2019m not interested in symbolisms. I use all that to shape another reality. What that reality has to say is another matter altogether. What matters to me is how you stand in front of an art-work. I don\u2019t look at it head on, I perceive it at my side. It\u2019s beside me, in other words. It\u2019s something I perceive better with my shoulders and my back. \"\"What do you mean exactly?\"\"I mean you have to be exactly where the work is. To be present at a given time and place, that\u2019s enough. And then you carry it around you as a memory. \"\"That reminds me of what Zen teaches about the experience of the \u2018here and now\u2019. You know that some people would refer to the minimal bamboo constructions you used to do as Zen constructions?\"\"Why not. . . that\u2019s Zen, too. \"\"Do you think 21st-century art should return to the concept of the beautiful which came in for so much stick during the 20th?\"\"I don\u2019t think it came in for any stick. I\u2019d say that beauty was held aloft again in both the 20th and 21st centuries. The concept of beauty is integral to art. \" In his years at the Athens School of Fine Arts, Alexiou met Dimitris Papaioannou, a stage director, choreographer, and visual artist. At the time, Papaioannou was a fellow pupil. The two men became friends and worked together on various projects. In 1990, Alexiou proposed a collaboration, using his own work as a base for Papaioannou to work upon. The result was The Last Song of Richard Strauss, which later became The Songs trilogy. The Last Song, a success for Papaioannou and the Omada Edafous Dance Theatre company, demonstrated work in the genre of set design. In 1993, Alexiou again collaborated with Dimitris Papaioannou in the production of Medea for the \"Omada Edafous Dance Theatre company\". Alexiou began collecting art at a young age. In 2009, he curated an exhibition of his collection of works by 70 modern and contemporary artists at the Bazeos Tower in Naxos. The tower is a 17th-century tower that was built as a monastery. The collected artists included Adam Chodzko, Bernhard Cella, Amy O\u2019Neill, Jim Shaw, Jimmie Durham, Andisheh Avini, Yuken Teruya, Antonis Kiriakoulis, Deanna Maganias, Giannoulis Chalepas, Elena Poka, Ilias Kafouros, Kostis Velonis, Dimitris Papaioannou, Mantalina Psoma, Emmanouil Zacharioudakis, Simon Periton, Marie Francoise Poutays, Mary Redmont, Michael Michaeledes, Minas, Spyros Litinas, Stephen Dean, Vasso Gavaisse, Lydia Venieri,Vangelis Vlahos and Yorgos Papountzis. The exhibition was an expression of the artistry of Alexiou (as much as his own work). The collected items paralleled his own development as an artist; the business of the final preparations of the exhibition reflected his passion; and the tower itself became an art subject itself in Alexiou's video productions of the day. Alexiou participated a large number of personal and group exhibitions. There are works which were never exhibited or are not known to the public.

G\u00e9za Alf\u00f6ldy was born in Budapest. He studied at the University of Budapest from 1953 to 1958, where he in 1959 received a doctorate. Alf\u00f6ldy worked at the Budapest city museum from 1957 to 1960, and from 1960 to 1965 he was an assistant professor at the Institute for Ancient History at the University of Budapest. In 1965, he emigrated to West Germany, where he initially worked at the Bonn Rhenanian State Museum from 1965 to 1968. During this time, Alf\u00f6ldy earned a habilitation at the University of Bonn in 1966, where he served as a university lecturer and eventually as a full professor. In the same year he became professor of Ancient History at the Ruhr University Bochum. Alf\u00f6ldy was appointed professor for Ancient History at the University of Heidelberg in 1975 and stayed there until his retirement in 2002. After the renewal of his professorship, Alf\u00f6ldy taught as a substitute professor until 2005. He died in 2011 whilst visiting Athens, Greece. In 2003, he acted as historical counsel for the two-part historical film \"Imperium: Augustus\" starring Peter O'Toole. Alf\u00f6ldys's main fields of research are: History and epigraphy of the Roman Empire Roman social, military and administrative history History of the Roman provinces Historiography of the Roman imperial era and late antiquity Roman prosopographyIn the 1990s, Alf\u00f6ldy also concerned himself with the modern history of his native Hungary. Within the scope of his epigraphical studies, Gez\u00e1 Alf\u00f6ldy visited many countries (Albania, Algeria, Austria, Britain, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Jordan, Libya, Portugal, Spain, Syria, Turkey, Tunisia, and Yugoslavia) in order to research original ancient inscriptions. Furthermore, Alf\u00f6ldy was a guest professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1972/73), in Rome from 1986 and 2003, in Paris (1991), and P\u00e9cs (still in 1993) in Pozna\u0144 (1992), in Budapest (1993), and also in Barcelona in 1997 and 1998. In addition, he continued to deliver diverse academic lectures both in and outside Germany, while supervising scores of new academics during their promotion or habilitation phases (more than one dozen alone since 1992). Alf\u00f6ldy was also co-editor of numerous international academic journals and periodicals. His name was especially associated with the Heidelberger Althistorische Beitr\u00e4ge und Epigraphische Studien (HABES), which he was sole editor from 1986. Alf\u00f6ldy was corresponding member or honorary member of multiple academic societies and academies and a respected member of the Heidelberg Academy since 1978. Apart from organizations like the Heidelberg Academy, Alf\u00f6ldy also worked at many other German research institutes: the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the German Archaeological Institute, as well as at Italian, French, and Spanish facilities for research of classical antiquity.

Alford, (1961-November 14, 2011) was a British writer and speaker on the subjects of ancient religion, mythology, and Egyptology. His first book Gods of the New Millennium (1996) drew on the ancient astronaut theory of Zecharia Sitchin and became a number 11 non-fiction bestseller in the UK. In his subsequent writings, however, he admitted to serious faults in his use of Sitchin's theory and proposed an alternative, cataclysm theory of ancient myth: \"I am now firmly of the opinion that these gods personified the falling sky; in other words, the descent of the gods was a poetic rendition of the cataclysm myth which stood at the heart of ancient Near Eastern religions. \"Alford's recent work focuses on the importance of the creation myth in ancient Egyptian religion. Born in 1961, Alan Alford was educated at King Edward VI School in Southampton, England and gained a degree in Commerce from the University of Birmingham in 1982. He became a qualified chartered accountant in 1985, while training with Arthur Young Chartered Accountants in Southampton. He pursued a career in industry, working for McCarthy & Stone plc, Flight Refuelling plc, and South Staffordshire Water plc (during this time he gained an MBA from the University of Coventry). He left the latter company in 1995, and began a new career as a writer. Gods of the New Millennium, Hodder & Stoughton, 1997; first published by Eridu Books, 1996.

Pyramid of Secrets, Eridu Books, 2003, trade paperback edition The Midnight Sun, Eridu Books, 2004, trade paperback edition. In Gods of the New Millennium (1996 & 1997), Alford drew the attention of the British public to the theories of the ancient astronaut writer Zecharia Sitchin. The book was a commercial success. However, less than two years later, Alford began to contradict his mentor by arguing that the gods personified the explosion of a heavenly planet which had shaped the creation of the earth. Alford's doubts about Sitchin's theory emerged while reading the Pyramid Texts as research for his book The Phoenix Solution (1998). In so doing, he found little evidence to support the ancient astronaut theory, but rather found correspondences between the Egyptian myths and the \u2018exploded planet hypothesis\u2019 of the American astronomer Tom Van Flandern. Alford affirms that the key to his U-turn was the realisation that \"the gods personified the cataclysmic powers of creation\". Nevertheless, many of his readers prefer the conspiracy theory that Alford was silenced by the CIA. Having realised his mistake, Alford began his own investigation of the Mesopotamian mythological texts. The result was When The Gods Came Down (2000), in which he refined and extended his cataclysmic theory of myth while penning a hard-hitting rebuttal of the ancient astronaut interpretation. Coinciding with the publication of this book, Alford published on his website an extensive \u2018Self-critique\u2019 of his first book Gods of the New Millennium. At this time also the paperback edition of GOTNM began to carry a new foreword in which the author expressed his reservations about chapters 6 to 16. In The Atlantis Secret (2003), Alford attacked the Euhemerist and Von Daniken theories of myth, arguing that the Greek gods were not deified heroes or astronauts but personifications of cataclysmic events from the beginning of the world. As for the ancient belief that the gods had granted the gifts of civilisation to man \u2013 a myth commonly cited by ancient astronaut writers \u2013 this was a natural extension of the \u2018birth from the earth\u2019 myths which were popular in ancient times. The \u2018exploded planet hypothesis\u2019 of myth first appeared in Alford's book The Phoenix Solution, and was followed up in his subsequent books When The Gods Came Down and The Atlantis Secret. In The Phoenix Solution, Alford noted various Egyptian texts which appeared to describe \u2018the fall of the sky\u2019 and the ensuing fertilisation of the earth. Drawing on the controversial work of astronomer Tom Van Flandern, he interpreted this mythological drama (which is well known also in Sumerian mythology) as a theorised (but not observed) planetary explosion which took place millions of years in the past. Much of Egyptian mythology, he claimed, was based on the imagined \u2018death and resurrection\u2019 of this long-lost planet, which was personified as a kind of creator-god. In When The Gods Came Down, Alford extended the scope of his study to Mesopotamian and biblical mythology. In this book, he separated his own exploded planet hypothesis of myth from Van Flandern's exploded planet hypothesis of science. He argued that the Sumerian religion had been an \u2018exploded planet cult\u2019 and that its central myth had been encoded in tales of the gods coming down from the sky \u2013 of the deluge and the creation of man \u2013 of the wars between gods of heaven and earth \u2013 and of the sacred marriage of the god and the goddess. One of his most controversial claims was that the story of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ allegorised the fate of the heavenly planet, and that Jesus in all probability never existed unless as the lead actor in an ancient Passion play. In The Atlantis Secret, Alford underlined the importance of cataclysms in ancient Greek myth and suggested that the Greek gods had inherited many characteristics from the older Mesopotamian deities. He cautioned, however, that the ancients\u2019 belief in exploded planets did not require an actual explosion. Instead, he drew on the work of Victor Clube and Bill Napier to suggest that comets, fireballs and meteorites had been closely observed at the dawn of civilisation, and that the ancient sages had deduced an exploded planet, correctly or incorrectly, from first principles; the sages had then attributed the great cataclysm to the beginning of time. It should be noted, here, that there is an implied criticism of Velikovsky's historicist interpretation of cataclysm myths. Critics of Alford's theory say that it is atheistic, that planets do not explode, or that the ancients did not even understand the concept of a planet. More pertinent are the critics who suggest he is wrong to see the exploded planet as a monolithic explanation of all myth. In The Atlantis Secret (2003), Alford criticised historicist interpretations of Plato's Atlantis story and asserted that Atlantis never existed in a geographical sense. In keeping with recent Platonic scholarship, he took the story to be political allegory, based on Plato's critical view of Athens\u2019 status as a powerful but decadent maritime empire in the 5th century BC. But he argued that the story was simultaneously an allegory for the creation of the universe \u2013 following the geocentric cosmogony of the Greeks. In this way, he claimed that the story was indeed \"true\" \u2013 as Plato insisted it was \u2013 for the ancient sages believed that the myth of creation was a true account of how the universe had been brought into being. The details of Alford's theory are as follows: that Atlantis was a metaphor for the primeval underworld (the interior of the earth); that the invasion of the known world by Atlantis allegorised the eruption of the underworld; and that Ancient Athens represented the ideal city \u2013 an archetypal and metaphorical \u2018city\u2019 - which fell from the sky and defeated Atlantis by breaking into the underworld. While much of Alford's interpretation hinges on known parallels in Greek myth, for example Hesiod\u2019s tale of the battle between the gods and the Titans, the key to his theory is his exploration of parallels between Greek and Near Eastern myths. Drawing upon the recent work of scholars such as Walter Burkert, Martin West, and Charles Penglase, Alford suggests that the Greek poets and philosophers borrowed from their Near Eastern neighbours mythical ideas such as: the birth of the universe in a cataclysm; the fall of the sky; the lowering of 'cities' from heaven to earth; the fall of the golden age; the wars of the gods of heaven and the underworld; the fall of gods, islands and continents from heaven into the underworld or subterranean sea; the birth of all things from the earth or subterranean sea; and the idea that mythical peoples dwelt in heaven, the earth and the underworld. Alford's theory has been attacked by supporters of a historical Atlantis. A classical scholar welcomed his approach and complimented his efforts to elucidate the story from a mythological perspective, while remaining cautious about the 'exploded planet hypothesis' for the myth of the falling sky. In his book The Midnight Sun, Alford drew on the work of J. P. Allen to elucidate the 'physics' of the ancient Egyptian creation myth. He argued, following Allen, that the creation myth provided a coherent and consistent account of the creation of the cosmos, albeit on a geocentric view, and accordingly proposed a central role for this myth in our understanding of ancient Egyptian religion. He further argued, contra Allen and others, that the sun-god was secondary to the creator-god in Egypt, being tasked (alongside the pharaoh) with re-enacting the creation myth in order that the cosmic order (ma'at) be made to endure for ever. Alford thus held that the traditional cults of Egyptian religion were facets of a unifying 'cult of creation'. In keeping with this creational view of Egyptian religion, Alford is a sceptic of the orthodox solar interpretation of obelisks and pyramids. He maintains that these monuments commemorated the creation of the cosmos, the benben stone at the apex representing the seed of the creator-god which had been raised from the earth into the sky. Alford has also proposed that the Pyramid Texts \u2013 such a puzzle to scholars \u2013 make sense as a ritualistic re-enactment of the events of creation, in which the king played the part of the creator-god and hence emerged from the earth into all parts of the cosmos. Unlike other alternative pyramid theorists, Alford interprets the Great Pyramid in the context of ancient Egyptian religion. Crucially, however, he redefines the builders\u2019 religion, arguing that it was not a sun cult per se but a \u2018cult of creation\u2019, and he devotes an entire volume The Midnight Sun (2004) to the establishment of this idea. Alford takes as his starting point the golden rule that the pharaoh had to be buried in the earth, i. e. at ground level or below, and this leads him to conclude that Khufu was interred in an ingeniously concealed cave whose entrance is today sealed up in the so-called Well Shaft adjacent to a known cave called the Grotto. He has lobbied the Egyptian authorities to explore this area of the pyramid with ground penetrating radar, and although nothing has happened yet it is quite possible that one day this theory will be put to the test. The cult of creation theory also provides the basis for Alford's next big idea: that the sarcophagus in the King's Chamber \u2013 commonly supposed to be Khufu's final resting place \u2013 actually enshrined iron meteorites. He maintains, by reference to the Pyramid Texts, that this iron was blasted into the sky at the time of creation, according to the Egyptians\u2019 geocentric way of thinking. The King's Chamber, with its upward inclined dual \u2018airshafts\u2019, was built to capture the magic of this mythical moment. The rest of the Pyramid is interpreted by Alford as a network of secret chambers in which religious relics were concealed \u2013 hence the title of his book Pyramid of Secrets. This is the weakest part of his case, as the textual support for the idea is thin and there is no way of knowing what might have been contained in the chambers that we know of today. Once again, Alford's theory can be proven or negated by future exploration, since it is central to his case that further secret chambers exist. In this regard, his thoughts are guided by the scholar J. P. Lepre, who claimed that anomalous patterns in the Pyramid's masonry joints might be signs to the existence of hidden passages and chambers. Alford's most speculative idea is that the King's Chamber generated low frequency sound via its \u2018airshafts\u2019, the purpose being to re-enact the sound of the earth splitting open at the time of creation. This theory is an attempt to explain the builders\u2019 use of stacked roofs with enormous granite beams above the chamber's ceiling. Egyptologists, however, do not see a mystery in these roofs and would therefore reject this as an unnecessary hypothesis. Ancient Aliens Ancient astronauts Chariots of the Gods?

He was an elected legislator in the Kashmir State Assembly for three consecutive terms. Mr Sadiq Ali was born in Srinagar into an influential business family. His father, the late Mr. Jaffer Ali was a Paper mache artist and businessman. Sadiq Ali graduated from Aligarh Muslim University and earned his MA in Political Science. He has given some important recommendations about the solution of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. His self-rule report has been widely applauded in both India and Pakistan and his recommendations have been regarded as one of the most workable solutions of this issue. He has also written a comprehensive paper on the deteriorating conditions of the forests of Jammu and Kashmir State; he has further submitted an indepth research paper outlining how the Dal Lake may be saved from further degradation. Mr Sadiq Ali entered politics at a very young age, and was one of the closest associates of Sheikh Abdullah, the founder of National Conference. He was nominated to the State Legislative Council numerous times. He also held the position of treasurer of the JKNC for 23 years. He quit National Conference stating personal reasons, although he never spoke against the NC party or its principles. There was widespread speculation that the only reason Mr Sadiq Ali quit NC was because of the NC leadership's inadequate action against a rival from within NC, whom Mr Sadiq had accused of sabotaging his re-election bid from Zadibal. On 9 March 2008, Farooq Abdullah, the patron of NC, announced to the media that Mr Sadiq Ali had rejoined the party and would be handling the state affairs of the party. "}, {"text": "Ramiz Taf\u00eb Alia (pronunciation ; 18 October 1924 \u2013 7 October 2011) was the second and last leader of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania from 1985 to 1991, served as First Secretary of the Party of Labor of Albania. He was also the country's head of state from 1982 to 1992. He had been designated as successor by Enver Hoxha and took power after Hoxha died. Alia died on 7 October 2011 in Tirana due to lung disease, aged 86. Alia was born on 18 October 1924. His parents were from Gheg clan and they fled from Kosovo during the Balkan Wars. He grew up and spent his childhood in Tirana. In the early part of World War II Alia was a member of a Fascist youth organization known as the 'Fascist Lictor Youth Organization' but joined the underground Albanian Communist Youth Organization in 1941. In 1943, he became a member of the Albanian Communist Party. He had risen rapidly under Hoxha's patronage and by 1961 was a full member of the ruling Political Bureau (Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania). Hoxha chose Alia for several reasons. First, Alia had long been a militant follower of Marxism-Leninism and supported Hoxha's policy of national self-reliance. Alia also was favored by Hoxha's wife Nexhmije, who had once been his instructor at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. His political experience was similar to that of Hoxha; and inasmuch as he appeared to share Hoxha's views on most foreign and domestic issues, he accommodated himself to the totalitarian mode of ruling. After World War II, Alia resumed his duties in the Communist Youth Organization, and at the First Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour in November 1948, he was elected to its Central Committee and was assigned to the department of agitation and propaganda. When he succeeded Hoxha in 1985, the country was in grave difficulty. Political apathy and cynicism were pervasive, with large segments of the population having rejected the government's values. The economy, which suffered from low productivity and permanent shortages of the most basic foodstuffs, showed no sign of improvement. Social controls and self-discipline had eroded. The intelligentsia was beginning to resist strict party controls and to criticize the government's failure to observe international standards of human rights. Apparently recognizing the depth and extent of the societal malaise, Alia cautiously and slowly began to make changes in the system. His first target was the economic system. In an effort to improve economic efficiency, Alia introduced some economic decentralization and price reform in specific sectors. Alia did not relax censorship, but he did allow public discussions of Albania's societal problems and encouraged debates among writers and artists on cultural issues. In response to international criticism of Albania's record on human rights, the new leadership loosened some political controls and ceased to apply repression on a mass scale. In 1989, general amnesties brought about the release of many long-term prisoners. He strengthened ties with Greece, Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. A loosening of restrictions on travel and tourism resulted in a more promising outlook for Albania's tourist trade. Despite Alia's efforts to proceed with change on a limited, cautious basis, reform from above threatened to turn into reform from below, largely because of the increasingly vocal demands of Albania's youth. On 9 December 1990, student demonstrators marched from the Enver Hoxha University (now University of Tirana) at Tirana through the streets of the capital shouting slogans and demanding reforms. By 11 December, the number of participants had reached almost 3,000. In an effort to quell the student unrest, which had led to clashes with riot police, Alia met with the students and agreed to take further steps toward democratization. The students informed Alia that they wanted to create an independent political organization of students and youth. Alia's response was that such an organization had to be registered with the Ministry of Justice. In his traditional New Year's message to the Albanian people, Alia welcomed the changes that had been occurring in the country and claimed that 1991 would be a turning point in terms of the economy. Despite positive signs of change, many Albanians were still trying to leave their country. At the end of 1990, as many as 5,000 Albanians crossed over the mountainous border into Greece. Young people motivated by economic dissatisfaction made up the bulk of the refugees. Alia was a crucial figure in the peaceful political transition of the early 1990s as many believe that he helped the rise to power of the anti-communist opposition forces thus eliminating possible bloodshed. Alia managed to remain a key political figure throughout several political crises. Nonetheless, with Albania in the throes of a grave economic crisis, Alia had to face challenges that he could not surmount. After the collapse of a coalition government in December 1991 and the Democratic Party of Albania's (DPA) landslide victory in the spring 1992 general election, he resigned as president on 3 April 1992. On 9 April the People's Assembly elected DPA leader Sali Berisha as Albania's new head of state. On 21 May 1994, senior officials from the Communist government, including Ramiz Alia, went on trial. Alia was charged with abuse of power and misappropriation of state funds, as was prime minister Adil Car\u00e7ani, deputy prime minister Manush Myftiu, and Rita Marko who was a vice-president. Alia had been placed under house arrest in August 1992 and his detention was converted into imprisonment in August 1993. In court he claimed he was the victim of a political show trial and demanded that the trial be broadcast on television, a request denied by the presiding judge. The trial was monitored by a Human Rights Watch representative and proceeded with only minor due process irregularities. The ten defendants were found guilty as charged and sentenced to between three and nine years in prison; Alia received a nine-year sentence. A court of appeals subsequently reduced some of the sentences, notably Alia's to five years. Alia, Myftiu, Car\u00e7ani, Stefani and Isai were also ordered to repay various sums to the state. On 30 November, the Court of Cassation reduced Alia's term by an additional three years. On 7 July 1995, Ramiz Alia was freed from jail. However, his freedom was short-lived and in 1996 he was charged with committing crimes against humanity during his term, and was imprisoned anew in March. The trial against him began on 18 February 1997, but he escaped from the prison following the unrest in the country and the desertion of the guards. Amid the unrest he appeared on State TV in an exclusive interview with Blendi Fevziu. In the late 2000s he was sometimes seen travelling to Albania from Dubai to give interviews or publicize his books. Ramiz Alia died on 7 October 2011 in Tirana from lung disease, shortly before his 87th birthday, according to a spokesman for President Bamir Topi. List of Presidents of Albania Alia, Ramiz.

Born in Micanopy, Florida, near Gainesville in 1912, Alison graduated from the University of Florida School of Engineering and joined the United States Army Air Corps in 1936. He earned his wings and was commissioned at Kelly Field in 1937. Prior to America's entry into World War II, he served as Assistant Military Attache in England and helped British pilots transition into the P-40. In October 1941, Alison traveled to Moscow to administer the sensitive U. S. -Soviet P-40 Lend-Lease program. He trained Russian pilots in the P-40, A-20, and B-25 Mitchell aircraft. In his autobiography, Jimmy Doolittle wrote: I might have gone to Russia, but Lieutenants Hubert Zemke and Johnny Alison, who had also been sent to England as observers, went instead. Good men, they both became aces later in the war. Johnny became a major general. After ten months and repeated requests for reassignment to combat, Alison got his wish. In June 1942, he reported to the China-Burma-India Theater (CBI) to serve as Deputy Squadron Commander under major David Lee \"Tex\" Hill in the 75th Fighter Squadron, part of Colonel Robert Lee Scott Jr. 's 23rd Fighter Group, the USAAF successor of the AVG's famed Flying Tigers in the China-Burma-India Theater. Alison was called into theater by the previous commander of the AVG, Brigadier General Claire Lee Chennault, who was serving as Commander of the Fourteenth Air Force. On July 30, 1942, Alison was credited with the first night kills in the theater. For his experimental night interception, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Alison again demonstrated his aggressiveness in early 1943, when he took off during an attack on his own airfield, engaged three Mitsubishi A6M Zeros, and scored one probable kill. He then vectored arriving reinforcements to the battle, after which he made a stern attack on another enemy fighter at close range, shooting it down. His gallantry and fighting spirit earned him the Silver Star. Ending his tour as commander of the 75th Fighter Squadron, Alison left as an ace with seven confirmed victories and several probable kills. His former commanding officer, David Lee \"Tex\" Hill, had high praise for Alison: John Alison had the greatest pure flying skill of any pilot in the theater \u2014 a touch on the controls that knew no equal. His talents were matched only by his eagerness for combat. After returning home in May 1943, Alison was recalled to the CBI theater by Gen. Henry \"Hap\" Arnold to co-command (along with Lt. Col. Philip G. Cochran) the newly formed 1st Air Commando Group, also known as Project 9. As leader of this secret and highly innovative flying unit, Alison led a composite wing of fighters, bombers, transports and gliders in the dramatic \"aerial invasion of Burma,\" dubbed Operation THURSDAY. The 1st Air Commandos supported the British \"Chindit\" Special Forces' infiltration of Japanese rear supply areas. In March 1944, Alison's men flew more than 200 miles behind enemy lines, transporting, re-supplying, and providing fire support for over 9,000 Allied forces. Alison's innovative leadership and combat daring as co-commander of the 1st Air Commandos helped to turn the tide of the Allied war effort in the CBI theater. Alison later commanded the 3rd Air Commando group in the Pacific serving in the Philippines and Okinawa. After the war, he served as an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, President of the Air Force Association, and as a major general in the Air Force Reserve. He retired as vice president of the Northrop Corporation in 1984 and is a 1994 inductee into the Air Commando Hall of Fame. In 2005 Alison was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. Alison died on June 6, 2011 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on October 3, 2011. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton A. Schwartz provided the eulogy at the Old Post Chapel at Joint Base Myer\u2013Henderson Hall. Following the chapel service, Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley presented the American flag to Alison's wife, Penni, at the graveside service. Alison was survived by Penni, and their two sons, John and David. Shortly before his passing, he authorized the Washington DC Chapter of the Air Commando Association to use his name and they are known as the John R. Alison Chapter of the Air Commando Association.

His compositional output includes several preludes for organ, an organ work on French carols, some motets and other choral works, a communion service, a prelude and fugue for string orchestra, and a polyphonic mass. He also wrote Suite laurentienne for orchestra from which the Po\u00e8me and the Menuet were premiered by the Quebec Symphony Orchestra in 1949, and composed the music for the 1953 film The Man on the Beach. His Marche (1964) and Petite Suite (1965) were both written for the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps Band. Born in Berlin, New Hampshire, Allaire moved with his family to Danville, Quebec when he was just two years old. He began studying the organ and piano as a child. He began professional studies in the organ in Victoriaville in 1934, continuing with his education in Quebec City in 1936. He entered the Conservatoire national de musique in Montr\u00e9al in 1940 where he was a pupil of Auguste Descarries (piano) and Eug\u00e8ne Lapierre (organ). After earning a Bachelor of Music from the conservatoire in 1947, he pursued further studies in fugue, orchestration, and music composition with George Rochberg in Philadelphia from 1948-1950. In 1953 Allaire entered the University of Connecticut where he earned a Master of Arts in music history and composition in 1956. He went on to earn a PhD in musicology from Boston University in 1960 after writing a doctoral thesis entitled The masses of Claudin de Sermisy. He pursued further studies in musicology in Europe and the United States through grants from the Canada Council (1961-2), a Fulbright Fellowship (1962), and a grant from the Minist\u00e8re des Affaires culturelles du Qu\u00e9bec (1965). In 1973 he was awarded a fellowship from the Canada Council to pursue musicological research in Spain. From 1962-1967 Allaire taught on the music faculty of Loyola College in Montreal. He then served on the music faculties of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (1966\u20131967) and the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton (1967\u20131984). At the latter institution he served as a research officer from 1969-1973, president of the Canadian Folk Music Association in addition to being a lecturer. After his retirement from teaching in 1984 he was named professor emeritus at the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton. He continued to research and publish articles on renaissance polyphonic vocal music with the Revue Belge de Musicologie, and on his website allairefictamusic. com which he kept up until 2010 As a performer, Allaire toured as both an organ and piano recitalist throughout Canada. A number of these recitals were nationally broadcast on CBC Radio between 1967-1970. As a writer and musicologist he contributed articles to several musical journals, including the Revue de musicologie (Paris), the Music Scene, EMC, the Boston University Journal, and the journal of the University of Moncton.

"}, {"text": "Kirby Allan (born Sidney Allen Pittman, January 12, 1928 \u2013 June 16, 2011) was an American record producer who is best remembered for his work with Chaino, in the musical genre of Exotica, and the Jungle variant of Tiki culture music. Their collaboration and unusual marketing strategy began with a series of albums in the late 1950s. Those albums (and singles from them) continue to be released as recently as 2016. Allan was born on January 12, 1928, in Prescott, Arkansas, to John Allen Pittman and Nettie Anne Stivers-Pittman. He was a World War II veteran who served as a medic in the United States Army. After his military discharge, Allan used his GI Bill to enter the Chicago Conservatory of Music, and he began singing in various Chicago night clubs. Allan moved to Hollywood during the early 1950s, where he established MAZE Records. He wrote and performed songs such as \"Don't You Remember\", \"My Life, My Love, My All\", \"Never, Never, Never\", \"More Bounce To the Ounce\", and \"Mother Don't 'Llow Rock'n'Roll\". He enjoyed a successful career as a nightclub singer and producer, but in the late 1950s, he traveled to Africa, and became enamored with the ceremonial sounds that were used by various tribes of Kenya, and the Gold Coast. His love for this 'Exotica' led him to 'produce' the ceremonial drumming he'd heard. Upon returning to the United States from Africa, Allan sought out a performer with whom he could produce a sound that was similar, but which was more marketable to American consumers. It was during this search that Allan met Leon Johnson, a bongo player who would come to be known as Chaino. In the years between 1957 and 1959, Allan produced eight albums with Johnson, often at LA's legendary Gold Star Studios. Allan's production work with Johnson featured repeated, driving rhythms, savage cries, and tribal iconography that was; \"intended to trigger the pagan fantasies of the listener\". Their first albums included Unbridled Passions Of Love's Eerie Spectre (1957), Jungle Mating Rhythms (1958), and Percussion for Primitive Lovers (1958). As a marketing strategy, Allan designed LP album liner notes that told the story of 'Chaino'; \". . . an orphan from a lost tribe in Africa who was taken in by missionaries and brought to the U. S. \" Johnson was actually born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Allen's literary fiction was reason enough for one music critic to comment that \". . . (Johnson's). . . association with Kirby Allan was a classic case of 1950s, pop marketing gone awry. . ,\" while also pointing out his opinion that; \". . . (Allen's). . . albums can be hard to find but usually are good values. \"In June 1958, Billboard gave Eyes of the Spectre a four-star review and noted; A truly unusual sound can be heard on this album. Chaino turns in what amounts to a one-man show on a variety of bongos, congo drums, steel drums, gourds and assorted noisemakers, altho the label's sound work doesn't do it real justice. Rhythms are basically African or Afro-Cuban. In the background, Chaino whistles, wails and occasionally gives a blood-curdling whoop. Allan would go on to produce five more albums with Johnson. His last album of new material with him was Africana, recorded in 1959, though both Allan and Johnson had small roles as bongo players in Curtis Harrington's 1961 movie, Night Tide with Dennis Hopper, Linda Lawson, and Gavin Muir. Some interest in Exotica had waned by the early 1970s, but Allan continued to oversee the production of 'Chaino' compilations, re-releases, and cover versions for those who were still interested in the genre. To further his efforts, Allan established the 'Exotica And Beyond' website, and by 2008, three of Allan's LP album covers had received positive reviews on the 'LP Cover Lover' website. Allan moved to Mesa, Arizona in 1970, and while he remained active in the entertainment industry, he also became a real estate broker and investor. He developed an interest in local politics and he ran for mayor of Mesa, nine times. Allan died in the early morning hours of June 16, 2011, while helping longtime companion Sigrid Dietrich, escape a fire that consumed his home in Mesa, Arizona. His burial was at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Mesa. Allan had five children; Jeff, Marc, Eric (deceased 1996), Monique, and Patric. Allan's productions have been reissued many times over the years and compilations that include his works were released as recently as 2016. Though originally produced on vinyl, much of his work has been re-released in modern formats (CD's) and can be found on various music download sites, such as 'iTunes' and 'Spotify'. In 1999, three of Allan's productions, \"Breathing Bongos\", \"Slave Girl\", and \"Walking Bongos\" were used in the movie, Forces of Nature. In addition, websites that celebrate the Tiki Culture continue to provide resources and information about Allan's work.

At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former member of the House of Commons. The son of Brigadier General Walter Allason DSO & Bar (1875\u20131960) by his wife Katherine Hamilton Poland, daughter of Vice-Admiral James Augustus Poland, James Allason was raised primarily by a great-aunt following the death of his mother in 1913 protecting the infant James in a fall down stairs. Walter Allason was grandson of the architect Thomas Allason. He was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He served as an officer in the British Army for 24 years from 1930 to 1954, including in India, Ceylon and Burma, rising to the rank of Lt-Colonel. He joined the Royal Artillery in 1932 transferring to the 3rd Carabiniers in 1937. A gifted mathematician, he addressed the problem of using magnetic compasses with tanks: the Allason Sun Compass was adopted for use throughout the Asian theatre. Allason worked with the Supreme Allied Commander, Lord Louis Mountbatten, as joint planning staff officer in South East Asia Command and was wounded while commanding tanks during the Burma campaign. He was later decorated. He subsequently occupied a similar post as senior military planner at the War Office in London, answering Churchill's queries and providing briefings in the Cabinet War Rooms. His last planning task was to advise on the logistics of withdrawing from Palestine. From 1950 to 1954, he served at the War Office in charge of Army discipline. After leaving the Army Allason worked as a Lloyd's of London insurance broker. He was elected a councillor on Kensington Borough Council in 1956. Allason contested Hackney Central in 1955. He was Member of Parliament for Hemel Hempstead (after defeating Margaret Thatcher for the Conservative nomination) from 1959 to 1974, when, following boundary changes, he narrowly lost the seat in the October election of that year to Labour's Robin Corbett. In government he was acknowledged for his expertise not only on defence but in the arcane but key subject of pensions. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for War he had a ringside seat as the Profumo affair unfolded, refraining from publishing his inside account until after the death of Jack Profumo in March 2006. When the Conservatives were in opposition Allason was front bench spokesman on Housing for six years, and is credited with development of the policy of enabling council house tenants to purchase their own properties: this was taken up by Margaret Thatcher and adopted by subsequent Conservative governments, contributing to their electoral victories. After leaving Parliament he continued to exercise a rational influence on environmental policy from positions on the executive of the Town and Country Planning Association and the Environment Council\u2019s Transport Committee. Following the deaths of Patrick Maitland, 17th Earl of Lauderdale in December 2008 and Bert Hazell in January 2009, Allason became the oldest living former British Member of Parliament. As a sportsman he raced Bentleys at Brooklands, played polo with maharajahs in India, skied and sailed in international competition, and represented the House of Commons in five sports. He continued skiing until his 87th year, and continued to play Contract Bridge and attend the Opera, on which subjects he wrote. In 1946, he married Nuala (who acted as Nuala McElveen and Nuala Barrie), daughter of John A. McArevey, of Foxrock, Dublin. They had two sons, the younger of whom, the Intelligence historian Rupert Allason, followed him into Parliament as Member for Torbay. Julian (1948\u20132015), the elder son, was a photographer and travel-writer, as well as vice-president of the Anthony Powell Society. The marriage was dissolved in 1974. His wife continued to live at what had been their family home at 15 Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. Allason also lived at Pump Lane House, Bembridge, Isle of Wight.

Allbright was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers to announce recreated games played away from Ebbets Field to a network of radio stations on the East Coast that included more than 100 stations, providing facsimile coverage of 1,500 Dodgers games, despite never having seen one in person. Allbright was born in Dallas, Texas on November 26, 1923. As a child, he moved with his family to Ridgeway, Virginia, and would recreate games in his imagination using lineups that he had taken from the local paper. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After receiving training in radio broadcasting, Allbright hosted musical and dance programs on the air, and covered baseball and other sporting events for stations in the Washington area, producing both live and recreated accounts. Walter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, wanted to create a radio network to reach fans of the Dodgers located on the East Coast of the United States. Someone who had previous experience simulating games was desired, as such broadcasts were far less expensive than sending announcers and the required support staff to various stadiums. Assigned to find the right candidate, Dodgers president Buzzie Bavasi hired Allbright, who was working at the time for radio station WEAM in Virginia. Invited to spend time with the Dodgers at spring training, he observed the players in action, with an eye for details of each player's mannerisms that he could use in his recreations. Allbright began his broadcasting career with the Dodgers in 1949, and his recreations were presented on more than 100 radio stations by the following season. During his time with the Dodgers, he broadcast 1,500 games from a studio in Washington, D. C. , beginning each one with a statement required by the Federal Communications Commission that the contents of the radio program were a recreation of an actual game and then starting each game by stating \"This is Nat Allbright, from Ebbets Field!\"Allbright maintained notes and pictures in his studio of each National League ballpark to help make his descriptions as vivid as possible. An assistant sitting outside his recording booth would take details from the play by play feed and prepare a script listing the details of each half inning. Allbright would be notified of any gap in game play so that he would be able to stretch out the material with added commentary until the typed sheets needed for the next half inning were completed. Using the information transmitted about each pitch from the ballpark, Allbright would provide a running account of the game, using his knowledge of the players and their individual characteristics and quirks to provide a running color commentary for a game he could not see. Most of the sound effects he used were from recordings, though he had a knack for using dental clicks to simulate the sound of a ball being struck by the bat. He used records and tape recordings of the National Anthem, crowd murmurs, roars and jeers to help maintain the verisimilitude of the broadcasts, though sportswriter Leslie Timms of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal would reminisce that he could never figure out why the same vendor was shouting \"Cold Beer, Here\" regardless of which stadium the Dodgers were playing in. Allbright himself supplied the voice of the beer vendor, leaning away from the microphone to simulate the voice coming from the stands. If transmissions were not received from the live game, he might add in improvised foul balls; extensive lags could be turned into an imaginary rain delay to buy additional time, with thunder simulated by crinkling a piece of cellophane. In a 1955 article, sportswriter Red Smith described how Allbright never claimed to be broadcasting from Ebbets Field, but didn't make it clear that he wasn't, \"kind of leaving it up to the listeners to decide for themselves. \"After Fred Saigh, then owner of 90% of the St. Louis Cardinals, was convicted of income tax evasion and sentenced to 15 months in federal prison in January 1953, Allbright was part of a group of prospective buyers that sought to buy the team from Saigh. A month later, Saigh sold the team to a group led by the owners of Anheuser-Busch, accepting a lower offer of $3. 75 million to keep the team in St. Louis. From 1950 until 1961, Allbright did 1,500 broadcasts of games played by the Dodgers, though he never saw the team play in person. Washington Post sportswriter Bob Addie called Allbright the \"king of the baseball re-creators\", an art whose practitioners included Ronald Reagan. He was awarded a ring when the Dodgers won the 1955 World Series, their only championship in Brooklyn. Improving technology and the move of the Dodgers to Los Angeles in 1958 cost Allbright many of his fans, with the team's evening home games starting at 11:00 PM in the Eastern Time Zone where his radio stations were located. In the years after he retired from broadcasting for the Dodgers, Allbright began a company producing simulated recreations of sporting events, in which he would insert names supplied by customers as part of the recording. One client wanted to have himself inserted as a catcher for Dizzy Dean, pitching for the Cardinals in the 1934 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, while another customer had his father's name inserted into a game in which he supposedly played alongside Babe Ruth for the New York Yankees. Other recordings had couch potatoes playing for the Boston Celtics, boxing at Madison Square Garden and playing golf at the U. S. Open. During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, Allbright produced a manufactured account of the All-Star Game that was scheduled to have been played that year at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, but had been cancelled due to the work stoppage. The Washington Post lauded \"the fantasy created by Mr. Allbright\" that evening, noting that he \"had listeners sensing a breezy, summer Ohio night perfect for baseball\". Before the strike was settled after half of the 1982 NFL season had been lost, Allbright broadcast eight simulated games featuring the Washington Redskins facing their scheduled opponents, setting the imaginary pace for a season in which the Redskins would in reality go on to win Super Bowl XVII. Allbright died of pneumonia on July 18, 2011, in Arlington, Virginia at the Virginia Hospital Center. He was survived by his wife, as well as by a daughter and a son.

Morales was one of the first to champion the study of indigenous languages in Colombia. In 1934, Abad\u00eda Morales began living with seventeen separate indigenous Colombian tribes for ten years. Each of the tribes he observed represented a different language family within the country. Adabia Morales was able to classify the languages of 105 indigenous peoples into nine language families. He developed the \"Abadia Classification\" system to group the families by geographic distribution within Colombia. Abad\u00eda Morales was the author of over twenty-five books on linguistics, folklore, and identity. His best known work, Compendio General de Folclor (General Folklore Compendium) has sold more than 40,000 copies since it was first published in 1970. Compendio is now widely used as a social science textbook in Colombia. He also created a series of educational broadcast focusing on folklore, which have been broadcast on Radiodifusora Nacional de Colombia. Abadia Morales served as the folklore coordinator for the Musical Documentation Center at the Colombian Culture Institute, secretary of the National Folklore Board, and professor and head of the Center for Folklore Studies at the National University of Colombia. Guillermo Abad\u00eda Morales died of natural causes on 21 January 2010 at the age of 97. Abadia was born in Santa Fe de Bogota in 1912. In 1914, his Family moved to the neighboring town of Sopo, Colombia, only to return to Bogota in 1919. He completed his high school education at la Escuela Ricaurte. After which he enrolled at the National University in Bogota where he spent five years studying medicine and pharmacy. During this period, he participated in an educational vaccination program in the jungles of the Choco region. It is here that he began to familiarize himself with the traditional cultures of Colombia. From 1934-1944 Abadia spent 10 years studying the language systems of indigenous Colombian populations. As a result of this work, he managed to classify 105 indigenous populations into nine language families. This system became known as the \u201cAbadia Classification\u201d. Abadia Morales joined the faculty at the National University of Colombia as a professor of the conservation of music. He kept this post for 22 years and later became the director of the Center for Folkloric Studies. He also helped to found El Museo Organolico de Colombia and the Instituto Colombiano de Cultura. In addition to his work in academia, Abadia Morales was the first broadcaster for a radio program HJN which eventually became Radiodifusora Nacional de Colombia. Here he helped create weekly programs that played and discussed the importance of Colombian oral history and music In addition to writing prolifically about Colombia folklore and music, he also wrote extensively about regional variations in Colombian dance. As mentioned, Abadia Morales wrote over 25 books that covered the diversity of Colombian music, folklore, and issues surrounding identity.

This refrigerator is extremely simple and does not require power, making it suitable for use in desert environments without easy access to electricity or repairs. It consists of a small earthenware pot placed inside a larger one, and the space between the two filled with moist sand. The inner pot is filled with whatever is desired to be cooled (fruit, vegetables, drinks) and covered with a wet cloth. The evaporating water draws heat from the inside through the porous outer pot, cooling the interior. Abba hails from a family of potmakers and tapped into the large underemployed local workforce for the project. Local pot-makers he hired produced the first batch of 5,000 pot-in-pot refrigerators. He received the Rolex Award for Enterprise in 2001 and used his $75,000 award to make the invention available throughout Nigeria. Abba devised an educational campaign tailored to village life and the illiterate population featuring a video-recorded play by local actors to dramatise the benefits of the desert refrigerator. The pots sell at 40 US cents a pair. Mohammed Bah Abba"}, {"text": "Isabella Aiona Abbott (June 20, 1919 \u2013 October 28, 2010) was an educator and ethnobotanist from Hawaii. The first native Hawaiian woman to receive a PhD in science, she became the leading expert on Pacific algae. Abbott was born Isabella Kauakea Yau Yung Aiona in Hana, Maui, Territory of Hawaii, on June 20, 1919. Her Hawaiian name means \"white rain of Hana\" and she was known as \"Izzy\". Her father was ethnically Chinese while her mother was a Native Hawaiian. Her mother taught her about edible Hawaiian seaweeds and the value and diversity of Hawaii's native plants. Abbott was the only girl and second youngest in a family of eight siblings. She grew up in Honolulu near Waikiki, and graduated from Kamehameha Schools in 1937. She received her undergraduate degree in botany at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa in 1941, a master's degree in botany from the University of Michigan in 1942, and a PhD in botany from the University of California, Berkeley in 1950. She married zoologist Donald Putnam Abbott (1920\u20131986), who had been a fellow student at the University of Hawaii as well as Berkeley. The couple moved to Pacific Grove, California where her husband taught at the Hopkins Marine Station run by Stanford University. Since at that time women were rarely considered for academic posts, she spent time raising her daughter Annie Abbott Foerster, while studying the algae of the California coast. She adapted recipes to use the local bull kelp (Nereocystis) in foods such as cakes and pickles. In 1966 she became a research associate and taught as a lecturer at Hopkins. She compiled a book on marine algae of the Monterey peninsula, which later was expanded to include all of the California coast. She was awarded the Darbaker Prize by the Botanical Society of America in 1969. By 1972, Stanford University promoted her directly to full professor. In 1982 both Abbotts retired and moved back to Hawaii, where she was hired by the University of Hawaii to study ethnobotany, the interaction of humans and plants. She authored eight books and over 150 publications. She was considered the world's leading expert on Hawaiian seaweeds, known in the Hawaiian language as limu. She was credited with discovering over 200 species, with several named after her, including the Rhodomelaceae family (red algae) genus of Abbottella. This earned her the nickname \"First Lady of Limu. \" In 1993 she received the Charles Reed Bishop Medal and in 1997 she received the Gilbert Morgan Smith Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. She was the G. P. Wilder Professor of Botany from 1980 until her retirement in 1982, upon then her and her husband moved to Hawaii where she continued her research as the professor emerita of botany at the University of Hawaii. She served on the board of directors of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. In November 1997 she co-authored an essay in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin criticizing the trustees of Kamehameha Schools, which led to its reorganization. In 2005, she was named a Living Treasure of Hawai'i by the Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii. She was considered the foremost authority on the algae of the Pacific Ocean basin and in 2008 she received a lifetime achievement award from the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources for her studies of coral reefs. Isabella Kauakea Aiona Abbott died at October 28, 2010 at the age of 91 at her home in Honolulu. Abbott's surviving family includes a daughter who resides in Hawaii and a granddaughter who lives in Hawaii. To preserve Abbott's legacy and career as a botanist, the University of Hawaii established a scholarship to support graduate research in Hawaiian ethnobotany and marine botany. Isabella A.

Abkey worked for Radio Mogadishu-Voice of Somali Republic in Somalia's capital city. He had a long career as a journalist and worked under difficult conditions during the last two decades of his career. Abkey was a well-known journalist in Somalia who had been working for media concerns since at least 1988 or possibly 1970. He had worked for East Africa Radio, SONA (the Somali News Agency), the radio station HornAfrik and for the Somali Television Network as a comedian and news anchor before going to work for Radio Mogadishu where he trained journalists with the country's Information Ministry. Associates said he turned down suggestions that for security he should live at the radio station and that he refused to be intimidated by the factions fighting in Mogadishu. He was abducted by armed hooded men early on the morning of 4 May and then later that day shot to death near his home in the Wardhigley neighbourhood of the capital. The editor of Radio Mogadishu, Abdirahman Yusuf, was quoted as saying, \"Al Shabaab men have killed Sheikh Nur Abkey . . . after they killed him, they called us and told us they killed him. \" Abdolaziz Mohamed Guled, Radio Magadishu's political correspondent said that Abkey was tortured before he was killed by his kidnappers. and eyewitnesses stated that Abkey's body was dumped on a Mogadishu street. It is believed that Abkey was killed because he was an employee of the government-run Radio Mogadishu, which had been against the extreme insurgents. Almost immediately, the International Press Institute condemned Abkey's murder. and in July 2010, Amnesty International condemned the killing of journalists and called for both the government forces and the armed militias to respect freedom of expression. The Secretary-General of the National Union of Somali Journalists, a partner-organization with Reporters Without Borders, said, \"Somali journalists are being murdered just for reporting their stories independently or because they work for a particular news media. The loss of this experienced journalist is heartbreaking for his family and colleagues, but it is also a blow to the entire Somali people. \"Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, said, \"I condemn the murder of Sheikh Nur Abkey.

Abono was born in Oakland, California, as Deborah Ann Downer, a granddaughter to E. M. Downer, who founded Mechanics Bank. She had served on the Board of Directors for the bank at one time. Her career as a heavy metal manager began in the mid-eighties when the members of Possessed, one of the first death metal bands, asked her to manage the group. After they assured her there was \"nothing to it . . . all you gotta do is get us shows,\" she agreed and even let them practice at her house. A grandmother at that time, Abono had no connections to heavy metal music other than through one of her daughters, who was dating Possessed's then-guitarist Larry LaLonde. According to author David Konow, Abono was unaware of the sometimes blasphemous themes of heavy metal, and was offended after reading the lyrics to Seven Churches, the band's debut album. Nevertheless, she agreed to continue managing Possessed on the condition that LaLonde and vocalist Jeff Becerra finished high school. Because Possessed suffered from internal conflicts, Abono would go on to manage additional bands in the Bay Area metal scene like Exodus, Vio-Lence and Forbidden, as well as death metal bands like Chicago's Broken Hope and Florida's Cynic and Obituary. Other bands that she managed included Sepultura and Skinlab. Abono died on Sunday, May 16, 2010, aged 80, after a battle with cancer. She was 80 years old.

Raimund Johann Abraham was born in 1933, in the town of Lienz, Tyrol in Austria, and he died on March 4, 2010, in Los Angeles, California. Throughout a 40-year career, Abraham created visionary projects and built works of architecture, in Europe and the United States. From 1952-1958, Abraham studied at the Technical University of Graz, and in 1959, he established a studio in Vienna, where he explored the depths and boundaries of architecture through building, drawing, and montage. Abraham's first book, the 1965 publication \"Elementare Architektur\" was made at a time of transition between architecture studies and practice. In this early volume on elemental structures, Abraham explores the built environment, absent aesthetic speculation, and determinations about design instead coming from the relative level of knowledge and also the desires of the builder. In 1964, Abraham emigrated to the United States. Abraham was an influential architect in his native Austria and the New York avant-garde. Abraham's poetic architectural vision was influenced by the Viennese tradition to align architecture with sculpture, and also by the Austrian physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach. Abraham theorized architecture on a collision course with the needs of humans, yet striving for coexistence, in a constant state of creative tension. Beginning in the late 1950s, his enigmatic architecture placed Abraham among the avant-garde, such as Hans Hollein, Walter Pichler and G\u00fcnther Domenig. In 1958, Abraham collaborated with Friedrich St. Florian, placing 3rd in an international competition to design the Pan Arabian University of Saudi Arabia, and in 1959, placing 2nd, for the design of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Cultural Center in L\u00e9opoldville. Abraham criticized mainstream architecture's preoccupation with style, it's indifference to history, and the rigid definition of Modernism at that time. Abraham went on to influence generations of professional architects through architectural drawings, projects, and teaching. A self-described incurable formalist, Abraham's notable built architecture includes House Dellacher (1963\u201367), in the Oberwart District of Burgenland, Austria, Public Housing Complex, (1968\u201369), and Experimental Kindergarten (1969-70) in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1973, Abraham was awarded the commission for Rainbow Plaza in Niagara Falls, New York, which he co-designed with Giuliano Fiorenzoli. The same year, Abraham was asked to transform the New Essex Market Courthouse building, located at 32 Second Avenue, New York City, for reuse as the Anthology Film Archives (1980\u201389), with collaborator-architects Kevin Bone and Joseph Levin. The portfolio Untitled marked the occasion. In the mid-1980s, Abraham won the architecture competition to build a mixed-use residential and commercial complex, IBABERLIN, in Friedrichstra\u00dfe 32-33 (1985\u201388), a major street in central Berlin, which forms the core of the Friedrichstadt neighborhood. The area was originally constructed to extend the city center, during the first half of the 18th century, in the Baroque style, and after significant damage during World War II, and then partly rebuilt before the division of the Berlin Wall. Abraham explained the work as a tribute to \"a city of memories, hope and despair. A City mutilated and fragmented by war, offended through reconstruction and isolated by political manipulations. Historical fragments remain, monuments of the past, elements for a new architectural beginning. New elements are suggested. First independent, then connected to form a dialectical topography of urban Architecture. \"Abraham contributed the design for Traviatagasse (1987-1991), in Vienna, with Carl Pruscha. Other buildings designed by Abraham include Residential/Commercial Building (1990\u201393), in Graz, Austria; House Bernard (1985), Hypo-Bank and Hypo-House (1993\u201396), situated in the historic center of the small town of Tyrol, in Lienz, Austria. In later years, Abraham designed his own home in Mazunte, Mexico. Among Abraham's many well known hypothetical projects is Seven Gates to Eden, a bold hand-drawn analysis of the suburban house, exhibited in the 1976 Venice Biennale, curated by Francesco Dal Co, and included in a 1981 show at the Yale School of Architecture, entitled Collisions, curated by New York architect George Ranalli. Abraham's City Of Twofold Vision, Cannaregio West, (1978\u201380), is sited in Cannaregio, the northernmost of the six historic districts of the historic city of Venice, Italy. Abraham also designed the Les Halles Redevelopment project (1980) for Paris, France, and Interior (2001), and his design for The New Acropolis Museum (2002) in Athens, Greece articulates new ideas about the contextualization of monuments. In 2002, Abraham contributed a poetic artistic response to New York's World Trade Center attack on September 11, 2001. Abraham's proposal is a poignant symbol to regain footing while envisioning a new future architecture for the City of New York. Perhaps Abraham's best known work of architecture is the Austrian Cultural Forum New York (1993-02), at 11 East 52nd Street; a building ingeniously arranged onto a site only 25 feet wide. Architectural historian Kenneth Frampton as recognized the Austrian Cultural Forum as \"the most significant modern piece of architecture to be realized in Manhattan since the Seagram Building and Guggenheim Museum in 1959. \" Another notable project, Musikerhaus or House for Musicians (1999), in Hombroich, near to D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. The built atop a former NATO missile base. Abraham adapted the site for reuse as an artists' residence and exhibition gallery. Abraham's Musikerhaus was completed posthumously, under the supervision of Abraham's daughter Una, in 2013. In 2015, The German Architecture Museum (DAM) identified Abraham's Musikerhaus as a significant new building constructed in Germany. Abraham was awarded a Stone Lion (1985), at the 3rd International Architecture Exhibition for \"Progetto Venezia,\" an international competition sponsored by the Venice Biennale, under the directorship of Aldo Rossi. He also earned the Grand Prize of Architecture (1995), and Gold Medal of Honor (2005) for meritorious service to the Province of Vienna. In 2011, Abraham was part of the ensemble cast in the film \"Sleepless nights stories,\" which included Marina Abramovic, Thomas Boujut, Louise Bourgeois, Simon Bryant, Phong Bui, Pip Chodorov, Louis Garrel, Bj\u00f6rk Gudmundsdottir, Flo Jacobs, Ken Jacobs, Harmony Korine, Lefty Korine, Rachel Korine-Simon, Kris Kucinskas, Hopi Lebel, Jean-Jacques Lebel, Diane Lewis, Jonas Lozoraitis, Adolfas Mekas, Oona Mekas, Sebastian Mekas, DoDo Jin Ming, Dalius Naujokaitis, Benn Northover, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Yoko Ono, Nathalie Provosty, Carolee Schneeman, Patti Smith, and Lee Stringer. The March 22, 2015 premiere of Scenes from the Life of Raimund Abraham (2013), by film diarist Jonas Menkas, is a cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style documentary of the lift of Raimund Abraham which carries its subject, the visionary architect, into the future. Abraham's article entitled ''The Meaning of Place in Art and Architecture\", published in 1983 refutes the opposition of Art and Architecture. Abraham is known for creating visionary architectural hand-drawings dominated by the elemental and archaic described in a few basic shapes. Throughout his career, Abraham asserted the autonomous, fundamental value of a drawing as a manifestation of architecture, stating, \"The drawing is one of the tools we have available for the realization of an architectural idea. \" To Abraham, drawing was as much the work of the architect as building. Critics describe Abraham's drawings as architectural poetry on paper. Many of his visionary drawings are exhibited and collected as fine art. During the 1960s and 70s, Abraham's interest in the typology of the house inspired masterful, visually compelling, imaginative architectural drawings, accompanied by evocative titles and texts, such as Glacier City, from the Linear City Series Project, Sectional perspective (1964) - an invisible city, between walls, on either side of a wide valley; Universal City, project, Sectional perspective (1966); Earth-Cloud House, project (1970); and The House with Curtains Project, Perspective (1972), about which Abraham notes, in the accompanying poem entitled \"Elements of the House,\" the opposing sensations and feelings, natural elements and cycles, and spatial components characterizing his subject,The House without Rooms, project, elevation and plan (1974). Abraham's drawn architecture explores human dwellings, the ritual of habitation, and the subjectivity of spatial conditions, especially interiority. Abraham's shadowy visions, such as Radar Cities, Terza Mostra d' Architettura, (1985); Jewish Museum Project, Judenplatz, Vienna, Austria Project, Exterior perspective (1997); and Metropolitan Core (2010) propose thoughtful architectural prototypes. The work is a prescient meditation on architectural scale, not only its relationship to the scale of the human body, but also the impact of scale upon multi-sensory perception and imagination. Abraham explained the inspiration for Nine Projects for Venice (1979\u201380): \"the absence of the mechanical scale of land-bound transportation, Venice, as no other City, has been able to retain a physiological morphology which has consistently reversed all known spatial principles of Cartesian origins. \" Abraham populates the city of Venice with architectural inventions, such as Wall of Lost Journeys, House For Boats, Square of Solitude, and Tower of Wisdom. Abraham's drawn architecture is symbolic of the mythology for collisions and the potential of architectural expression. In the collection Reynolda House Museum of American Art, Abraham's Untitled (1982) drawing of a geometric structure set in a hilly landscape; along the edge is composed (from top to bottom) of an isometric view, a side elevation, and cross-section. Abraham explained his role as an educator as follows: \"Teaching forces me to engage in a critical dialogue with somebody else, and find a level of objectivity that allows me to have a fair critical argument. My role as a teacher is simply to clarify, although that's a bit simplistic. When I give a problem to the students, it's my problem; I am trying to anticipate how I could solve that problem. And my joy is when the students come up with a solution I haven't thought of. \" After arriving in the United States in the mid-1960s, Abraham taught at Rhode Island School of Design, in Providence, Rhode Island, and then for 31-years, he was a professor of architecture at the Cooper Union School of Art and Architecture, New York, N. Y. , and adjunct faculty member at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York. Abraham was also variously a visiting professor in architecture design at the Open Atelier of Design and Architecture (OADA) in New York City; Hines College of Architecture at the University of Houston, Texas; Yale School of Architecture and Environmental Studies; Harvard Graduate School of Design; Architectural Association School of Architecture, London; Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), Los Angeles, California; Technical Universities, Graz; and University of Strasbourg. The work of Raimund Abraham has been exhibited widely at museums and galleries worldwide, including Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden; Museo Correr, Venice, Italy; Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; Pinacotheca, Athens, Greece; National Gallery (Berlin); Venice Biennale; German Architecture Museum, Frankfurt; Krinzinger Gallery, Innsbruck; Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts of Chicago, Illinois; and the Museum of Modern Art and Architectural League of New York. 2016: Back Home: the architecture of Raimund Abraham retrospective.

His book, The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates, first published in 1988 and subsequently updated and revised, is regarded as the authoritative reference work on the subject. His other books included Words of Peace, which brought together selections from the acceptance speeches of Nobel Peace Prize laureates, and five volumes of Nobel Lectures in Peace. Irwin Abrams was born in San Francisco in 1914. He graduated from Lowell High School in December 1930 at the age of 16. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Stanford University and a master's degree and Ph. D. from Harvard University. In 1936-37, he traveled to Europe to do research for his dissertation. It was a formative experience. He met many outstanding leaders and scholars of the international peace movement and delved into previously unknown source materials. \"Abrams opened and explored archival sources on which a generation of historians would come to depend,\" the Magazine of History said in a 1994 profile. \"His dissertation, A History of European Peace Societies, 1867-1899, won the Charles Sumner Peace Prize and, although it was never published, it has been called 'the most quoted unpublished dissertation in history'. Whether or not that is factual, it has the ring of truth, for Abrams's 1938 work and his subsequent writing gave direction and inspiration to historians on both sides of the Atlantic when the study of peace in history blossomed a generation later. \"Born Jewish, Abrams became a Quaker in the late 1930s, inspired in part by his research on the early peace movement and his friendships with British philosopher Gerald Heard and others. He later wrote that joining the Society of Friends was the final step in a move away from liberal humanism toward the ideal of pacifism and nonviolence. He came to believe that \"to change the world you had to change yourself. \" During World War II, Abrams fulfilled his obligations as a conscientious objector by working with the American Friends Service Committee, or AFSC, in Philadelphia. He researched international relief work, directed training for AFSC relief workers from 1943 to 1946 and organized the Quaker International Workcamp Program the following year. During that time, his wife Freda, whom he had married in 1939, stayed home with their two young children, David and Carole. A third child, James, was born a few years later. The family moved to Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1947 when Abrams joined the faculty of Antioch College. He organized the Department of History and created an introduction to western civilization still fondly remembered by many Antioch alumni. He became a full professor in 1951, Distinguished University Professor in 1979, and \"emeritus\" two years later. Throughout his Antioch years, Abrams was nudged beyond the classroom by his Quaker concern for peace, his pioneering studies of the historic European peace movement and his own international experience. He became, as he wrote, \"a theorist and practitioner\" in study abroad and intercultural experience. The number of international exchanges, including study abroad, was rising rapidly, and he saw this as a valuable opportunity to encourage cross-cultural understanding. After his retirement from teaching, Abrams published the first of several books on the Nobel Peace Prize. His The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History was published in 1989. It was recognized as an \"outstanding reference work\" by the American Library Association. He went on to publish other works on the prize, including Words of Peace, which brings together selections from the acceptance speeches of the prizewinners, and five volumes of Nobel Lectures in Peace. Of writing about the laureates, he wrote, \"It's been a rich experience to live with these people all of these years. \" He met many of the prizewinners, including the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Willy Brandt and Martin Luther King, Jr. Another laureate, Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, the current president of East Timor, considered him a friend. Abrams \"led a life of scholarly integrity, intellectual and moral rectitude, compassion and faith in humanity, encompassing a whole century of profound transformation in the history of our small world\", he said. Abrams was honored on numerous occasions by colleagues and former students. In 1997, he received an honorary doctorate from Antioch University. In 2000, he was given a distinguished lifetime service award by the Peace History Society and the Peace History Commission of the International Peace Research Association. In 2003, the Antioch College Alumni Association presented him with the Arthur Morgan Award \"for his long and exemplary service to the Antioch College community, the education community and the global community\". Abrams said that the happiest outcome of his teaching years was when his students from the class of 1955 came together in 2005 \u2013 50 years later \u2013 and raised funds for a peace education memorial fund in his name. He was inducted into the \"Walk of Fame\" in Dayton, Ohio, in the fall of 2007 and has a square on the sidewalk on W. Third Street in Dayton commemorating his achievements. The inscription states that \"Dr. Abrams brought recognition to Antioch University\" as a \"scholar, author, educator and humanitarian. \" The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History (G.

She founded the Orange County Feminist Repertory Theater and the first chapter of the National Organization for Women in Orange County, California. Rosalie Gresser Abrams was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1921. Her parents were Naomi and Albert Gresser. Eventually she would marry Maurice Abrams, and with their two children, they would move to Los Angeles, California in 1954. By 1960 they had moved to Anaheim. She obtained her bachelors (1971) and masters (1975), theater arts, from California State University, Fullerton. In the 1970s she would take up tap dancing, and performed into her 80's. In September 1969, Abrams founded the first chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) in Orange County, California, which was also the first major feminist organization in the county. In 1970 she served as vice president and the following year, she was president. The organization would find its base membership with members of the Unitarian faith, where Abrams was an active member. Abrams stated that many of the women who attended did so in secret, not wanting their husbands to know, and that the term \"women's liberation\" was considered a \"dirty word\" at the time. That year, 1971, she would found the Orange County Feminist Repertory Theater. The theater served as a unique venue for subjects that weren't being covered by other theaters in the area, specifically related to politics and women's rights. That same year, Abrams wrote \"Myth America: How Far Have You Really Come?\" which allowed Abrams to express her political and social views, and help raise funds for the NOW chapter with the play's performance. The play's first performance was held in Sacramento at the first California NOW conference. Abrams and her husband funded the rental payments for the first pro-choice feminist women's health clinic in Orange County, in 1973. The couple, along with other members of NOW and regional churches, were active in fighting against violence towards pro-choice women's clinics. Abrams described their role as defending clinics \"from being burned and destroyed, by staying overnight, sleeping in our cars, and securing the doors with our bodies. \" Abrams, along with five other women, picketed the Orange County Medical Center, demanding women's rights for abortions, after 47 women were denied abortions at the hospital due to a moratorium being placed on the procedure. The moratorium was started after protests by physicians, claiming that they were overworked due to having to perform over 20 abortions a week. The protest was organized by Abrams and the newly founded Orange County NOW chapter. During the protest she carried a sign reading: \"If Men Bore Children, Abortion Laws Wouldn't Exist. \" Three years later the United States Supreme Court would legalize abortion with Roe vs. Wade. In 1976, Abrams wrote and performed an original piece about Martha Beall Mitchell, which she performed during the bicentennial during the fifth annual California NOW conference. Abrams used not only her performances as educational tools, but also has taught courses on feminist issues at various regional schools and colleges. She would go on to become the \"feminist consultant\" for the psychology department at Fullerton College in 1975. She also did fundraising, lecturing, and facilitated discussion forums about the Civil Rights Movement, Sino-American relations, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Central American politics and American labor rights. In 1996, Abrams was awarded the Veteran Feminists of America Medal of Honor by NOW. As of 1997, Abrams had started a new program for the theater, focusing on local issues in the county and United States, believing that \". . . there are things that our country has been instrumental in doing that perpetuate the oppression of women all over the world. \" Abrams would later be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and served as a greeter at the local Unitarian church. Rosalie Abrams died on January 4, 2010, from complications related to Alzheimer's disease. Abrams believed that despite strong efforts to unite women and fight sexism, those efforts \"are now being slowly eroded. \" She supported the passing of the Equal Rights Amendment, which she believed would help women reach not only general equality with men, but equality in the workplace. Abrams also believes that abortion rights are still in need of fighting, stating that, despite the success of Roe vs. Wade, \"things don't happen in straight lines. The more successful you are, the worse the backlash becomes. \" "}, {"text": "Chimen Abramsky (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05de\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9; September 12, 1916 \u2013 March 14, 2010) was emeritus professor of Jewish studies at University College London.

He is famous for his project of a humanistic Qur'anic hermeneutics, which \"challenged mainstream views\" on the Qur'an sparking \"controversy and debate. \" While not denying that the Qur'an was of divine origin, Zayd argued that it was a \"cultural product\" that had to be read in the context of the language and culture of seventh century Arabs, and could be interpreted in more than one way. He also criticized the use of religion to exert political power. In 1995 an Egyptian Sharia court declared him an apostate, this led to threats of death and his fleeing Egypt several weeks later. He later \"quietly\" returned to Egypt where he died. Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd was born in Quhafa, a small village some 120 km from Cairo, near Tanta, Egypt on July 10, 1943. Abu Zayd went through a traditional religious school system and was a Q\u0101ri\u02be who could recite the Qur'an with the proper rules of recitation, and a Hafiz one who has memorized the Quran completely from a young age. At the age of 12, Abu Zayd was imprisoned for allegedly sympathising with the Muslim Brotherhood. He was also influenced by the writings of Muslim Brotherhood revolutionary Islamist Sayyid Qutb, who was executed by the Egyptian state in 1966, but moved away from the ideas of the Brethren and Qutb as he grew older. After receiving technical training he worked for the National Communications Organization in Cairo. At the same time, he started studying at Cairo University, where he obtained his BA degree in Arabic Studies (1972), and later his MA (1977) and PhD degrees (1981) in Islamic Studies, with works concerning the interpretation of the Qur'an. In 1982, he joined the faculty of the Department of Arabic Language and Literature at Cairo University as an assistant professor. He became an associate professor there in 1987. From 1985 to 1989, he worked as a visiting lecturer at Osaka University in Japan. In 1992 the process of his being considered for promotion to full professor at Cairo University morphed from a routine academic process into a \"legal nightmare for him and his wife. \" While he was eventually promoted, he was sued by conservative Muslims and a Court of Appeals declared him an apostate and divorced him from his wife. This was followed by calls for his death and exile to Europe where he obtained the position of Visiting Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Leiden University. (see below) In Europe he held the Ibn Rushd Chair of Humanism and Islam at the University for Humanistics, Utrecht, Netherlands, while still supervising MA and PhD students at the University of Leiden as well. He also participated in a research project on Jewish and Islamic Hermeneutics as Cultural Critique in the Working Group on Islam and modernity at the Institute of Advanced Studies of Berlin (Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin). In 2005, he received the Ibn Rushd Prize for Freedom of Thought, Berlin. His wife returned several times to Egypt for discussion on MA and PhD theses at the French department at Cairo University. Dr. Abu Zayd also returned several times to Egypt after 1995, but mostly to visit family. During a visit in Indonesia he was infected by an unknown virus, and was hospitalized in Cairo. He died at a Cairo hospital on July 5, 2010 at the age of 66. He was buried in his birthplace, on the same day. Zayd's academic work on the Qur'an led to a lawsuit against him by conservative Muslim scholars. The subsequent a hisbah trial led to him being declared an apostate (murtadd) by an Egyptian court. Since under Sharia law it was not permissible for a Muslim woman to be married to a non-Muslim man, the court also declared he could not remain married to his wife\u2014Cairo University French Literature professor Dr. Ibtihal Younis. This decision, in effect, forced him out of his homeland. The Nasr Abu Zayd case began when he was refused a promotion for the post of full professor. In May 1992, Dr. Abu Zayd presented his academic publications to the Standing Committee of Academic Tenure and Promotion for advancement. Among his thirteen works in Arabic and other languages were Imam Sh\u0101fi'\u012b and the Founding of Medieval Ideology and The Critique of Religious Discourse. The committee presented three reports, two were in favor of the promotion of Dr. Abu Zayd. But the third one, written by Abdel-Sabour Shahin, a professor of Arabic linguistics at the Cairo Dar al- 'Ulum, and a committee member, accused Abu Zayd of \"clear affronts to the Islamic faith,\" and rejected the promotion. Despite the two positive reports, the Tenure and Promotion Committee voted against the promotion (seven votes to six), arguing that his works did not justify a promotion. The Council of the Arabic Department stated against the committee's decision, and The Council of the Faculty of Arts criticized the committee report. Despite all that, the Council of Cairo University confirmed the decision of the committee report on 18 March 1993. Not content with blocking the promotion, at the pulpit at Amr Ibn Al-`Aas Mosque where he was a preacher, Shahin publicly denounced Abu Zayd as an apostate (murtadd). Shortly thereafter a \"flood of vitriolic articles accusing him of heresy\" appeared in the \"mainstream, semi-state press\". Critics of the case have noted that Shahin's interest in the beliefs of Abu Zayd may have been motivated by factors other than piety. In addition to being preacher during Friday Services at Cairo's oldest mosque and a host of a number of television and radio programs about Islam, Shahin was active in Egypt's ruling party as chairman of its religious committee, and a consultant in the late 1980s to the Rayyan Investment Company. Rayyan had touted itself as an Islamic financial outfit, appealing to pious Muslims who believed that Islam forbids them to receive interest. It promised to pay them instead with Islamically sanctioned `dividends. ` Badly run, the firm went bankrupt, depriving thousand of Egyptians of their life savings. In his book, Abu Zaid cited Rayyan as an example of how some Islamists used religious discourse for ulterior motives and material gain. Shahin had not been pleased with the criticism. In June (April according to another account), the case moved beyond Cairo University when a group of Islamists led by the former state official, Muhammad Samida Abu Samada and including Shahin, filed a lawsuit before the Giza Lower Personal Status Court (family court) in Cairo demanding the nullification of the marriage between Abu Zayd and his wife, Dr. Ibtihal Younis, arguing that Islamic law forbids a marriage between a Muslim woman and an apostate. (The couple were not notified but heard about the case first in the tabloid newspapers. )The court case was filed through personal status law for divorce because in this area \"the Islamic Shari'a is still in force\" in Egyptian law. Filing cases of hisbah against Muslims who violated a \"right of God\" and thus disturbed the public order was at one time the function of an official known as the muhtasib before that function had lapsed. The lawsuit by the Islamists resurrected hisbah and had the advantage that the plaintiffs did not have to be directly affected by a defendant's alleged wrongdoing. The hisbah principles are stated in Article 89 and 110 of the Regulations Governing Sharia Courts in Egypt but were amended in 1998, too late to help Abu Zayd. According to conservative Islamist scholars cited against Abu Zayd by the plaintiffs, the professor was an \"ignorant proponent of the Enlightenment `who understand[s] freedom of thought to mean freedom to lead the people to infidelity\". Another called Abu Zayd's work \"cultural AIDS\" and \"intellectual terrorism. \" (This critic was himself assailed as an apostate several years later for his own religious writings. )On 27 January 1994, the Giza Personal Status Court rejected the demand because the plaintiff had no direct, personal interest in the matter. However, on June 14, 1995 Cairo's Court of Appeals reversed the lower court ruling in favor of the plaintiff, judge 'Abd al-'Alim Musa (who had worked for several years in Saudi Arabia) found Abu Zayd to be an apostate, and declaring the marriage of Abu Zayd and Ibtihal Younis null and void. Reasoning of judgementAmong other things the court declared that the verse authorizing the discriminatory jizya tax on non-Muslims `is not subject to discussion`, and that owning slave women is allowed under certain conditions by `clear` Qur'anic verses `that we must follow`. Abu Zayd was also accused on not believing in jinn (genies). The judgement stated that: the defendant's proposition that the requirement of Christians and Jews to pay jizyah (poll tax) constitutes a reversal of humanity's efforts to establish a better world is contrary to the divine verses on the question of jizyah, in a manner considered by some, inappropriate, even for temporal matters and judgments notwithstanding its inappropriateness when dealing with the Qur'an and Sunnah, whose texts represent the pinnacle of humane and generous treatment of non-Muslim minorities. If non-Muslim countries were to grant their Muslim minorities even one-tenth of the rights accorded to non-Muslim minorities by Islam, instead of undertaking the mass murder of men, women, and children, this would be a step forward for humanity. The verse on jizyah, verse 29 of Surat al-Tawbah, which the defendant opposes, is not subject to discussion. The judgment stated that the questioning by Abu Zayd of the permissibility of the ownership of slave girls, a principle considered \"religiously proven without doubt\", is \"contrary to all the divine texts which permit such provided that the required conditions are met\". Court of Appeals head Judge 'Abd al- 'Alim Musa and his fellow jurists declared Abu Zayd to be \"a threat to national security, saying that by attacking Islam, he had attacked the state on which it is founded. \" The conservative religious interpretation of the court was evidenced a month after the ruling, when Judge Alim told an Egyptian magazine that Muslims are required to believe in spirits, devils, and the throne of God. In examining Abu Zayd's work and the charge against him of disbelieving in Jinn, scholar Michael Cook notes that Abu Zayd did not explicitly deny the existence of jinn, but explained their reason for being in the Qur'an as part of an appeal \"to existing Arab conceptions of communication between genies and humans\". Since jinn \"were part of the culture of the Arabs at the time when the Quran was revealed\" (and still are very much a part of Arab folk culture), without their inclusion \"the notion of divine revelation\" would have been difficult to accept. Promotion at Cairo UniversityThe irony of the story occurred when Cairo University promoted Abu Zayd to full professor and the academic committee wrote: After reviewing the works submitted by Dr. Abu-Zeid in his application for promotion, examining them both individually and as a whole, we have reached the following conclusion: his prodigious academic efforts demonstrate that he is a researcher well-rooted in his academic field, well-read in our Islamic intellectual traditions, and with a knowledge of all its many branches \u2014 Islamic principles, theology, jurisprudence, Sufism, Qur'anic studies, rhetoric and linguistics \u2014 He has not rested on the laurels of his in-depth knowledge of this field, but has taken a forthright, critical position. He does not attempt to make a critique until he has mastered the issues before him, investigating them by way of both traditional and modern methodologies. In sum he is a free thinker, aspiring only to the truth. If there is something urgent about his style, it stems from the urgency of the crisis which the contemporary Arab-Islamic World is witnessing and the necessity to honestly identify the ills of this world in order that an effective cure be found. Academic research should not be isolated from social problems, but should be allowed to participate in current debates and to suggest solutions to current dilemmas by allowing researchers to investigate and interpret as far as possible. The decision provoked a great debate, criticism abroad because of the violation of fundamental human rights but anger against Abu Zayd and death threats in Egypt. Abu Zayd himself lamented, \"it took one week for my name to be cursed all over Egypt. Even in my village they were saying I was teaching heresies to the students. . . \" Shortly after the verdict was issued, a group of professors at al-Azhar University, the \"theological centre of Egypt\", issued a joint statement calling for Abu Zayd's execution. The Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization (which assassinated Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1981 and was engaged in a guerrilla war with the government at the time) issued a statement saying the professor should be killed for abandoning his Muslim faith. But calls for his death were not limited to insurgents. Even a newspaper published by the ruling political party of the ostensibly secular anti-fundamentalist regime, The Islamic Banner, declared that `execution` was a fitting penalty if Abu Zayd failed to repent. In addition Abu Zayd received threats in the mail, one promising \"No matter how much the police tries to protect you, you will not get away. \". Dr. Nasr Abu Zayd was protected by the police, but belief in his apostasy was so widespread that even a police officer guarding his house referred to him as a \"kafir\" when asked about the situation by a neighbor of Abu Zayd. The Court case was based on the alleged apostasy of Nasr Abu Zayd, hence the decision was based on Qur'anic punishment. But the Egyptian Penal Code did not recognize apostasy, and Civil Law restricts the proof of apostasy to two possibilities: either a certificate from a specialized religious institution certifying that the individual has converted to another religion, or a confession by the individual that he has converted. Neither had been provided. Nasr Abu Zayd never declared himself to be an apostate. In an interview, he explained: I'm sure that I'm a Muslim. My worst fear is that people in Europe may consider and treat me as a critic of Islam. I'm not. I'm not a new Salman Rushdie, and don't want to be welcomed and treated as such. I'm a researcher. I'm critical of old and modern Islamic thought. I treat the Qur'an as a na\u1e63\u1e63 (text) given by God to the Prophet Muhammad. That text is put into a human language, which is the Arabic language. When I said so, I was accused of saying that the Prophet Muhammad wrote the Qur'an. This is not a crisis of thought, but a crisis of conscience. Furthermore, a number of rulings by the Egyptian Court of Cassation seem to contradicted the verdict: \"Since a Muslim inherits his/her religion from his/her parents, he/she does not need to re-announce his/her Faith\". \"It is stated that for a person to be a Muslim it is enough that he articulates his belief in Allah and the Prophet Mohamed. The judge may not look into the seriousness of incentives behind the confession. It is not necessary to make a public confession\". \"In accordance with the established course of this court, religious belief is considered to be a spiritual matter, and consequently is to be judged only by what is explicitly declared. Therefore, a judge is not to investigate the sincerity nor the motive of such declared statement\". \"This court has always taken the course established by the law that religious belief is among matters in which the judgment should be based on declared statement, and by no means should the sincerity or motives of this statement be questioned\". On 23 July 1995, the couple fled their homeland for an indefinite sabbatical. They flew to Madrid, then decided to go from Spain to the Netherlands, where he was invited to teach as a Visiting Professor at the Leiden University. Abu Zayd explained, I couldn't take more than two months of around the clock security. Whenever someone came to visit they had to be cleared. Whenever I wanted to go out I had to coordinate with security. I couldn't just go to a coffee shop with my friends and play a round of backgammon. What kind of life was that? Though his books were not officially banned in Egypt, they were pulled from the library shelves of his alma mater. On November 8, 1999, he filed a suit against the Egyptian justice minister, demanding that the 1996 ruling which annulled the marriage be declared illegal. The Egyptian government \"strived to ignore\" the case. There were only brief mentions of it in the state-run media and no government official spoke in his defense. However, in 1998, the regulations governing Sharia courts in Egypt were amended making it impossible for individuals to file lawsuits accusing someone of apostasy, leaving the issue to the prerogative of the prosecution office. The action against Abu Zayd was not isolated. During the 1990s there were several assaults on liberal intellectuals and artists in Egypt and elsewhere in the Muslim world. Ahmed Sobhy Mansour was dismissed from Al-Azhar University and imprisoned for six months. This was based on a verdict reached by the university itself on the grounds that he rejected a fundamental tenet of Islam in his research of truth of some of Muhammad's sayings, or Hadith. Egyptian Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz was stabbed in the neck by an Islamist in 1994, leaving him incapable of using his hand to write. Egyptian courts were the theatre of different lawsuits brought against intellectuals, journalists, and university professors such as Atif al-Iraqi, Ragaa al-Naqash, Mahmoud al-Tohami, and Youssef Chahine (for his film El-Mohager, The Emigrant). Abu Zayd's case has been described as demonstrating the \"coercive impulse behind much Islamism, as well as the unintended consequences of making concessions in its direction\", as those conservatives calling for his killing included religious figures and media supposedly co-opted by the regime. Other became suspicious of \"collusion\" between \"violent rebels and the conservative Islamists\" who held \"senior positions in some of Egypt's public institutions. \" Gilles Kepel) noted the case as a demonstration of how moderate and extremists Islamists could \"complemented one another's actions\". Rather than the moderates undermining the extremists as some had hoped, \"moderates\" (such as Abdel-Sabour Shahin and The Islamic Banner) would singled out victims as \"apostates\" who were then executed (or in Zayd's case provided with a very credible threat of murder) by the extremists (such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad). The \"moderates\" would deplore fanaticism of the extremists in public, but plead \"attenuating circumstance\" on their behalf when the need arose. His case has been compared to controversies over interpretation of the Quran involving Taha Hussein in the 1920s and Muhammad Ahmad Khalafallah in the 1940s. The fact that a well established/respected scholar like Abu Zayd \"suffered more concretely\" than the other two is an illustration of \"the gains made by Islamists in the last half of the 20th century. According to scholar Navid Kermani \"three key themes\" emerge from Abu Zayd's work: to trace the various interpretations and historical settings of the single Qur'anic text from the early days of Islam up to the present; to demonstrate the \"interpretational diversity\" (al-ta 'addud alta 'wili) that exists within the Islamic tradition; and to show how this diversity has been \"increasingly neglected\" across Islamic history. Abu Zayd saw himself as an heir to the Mu\u02bftazila, \"particularly their idea of the created Qur\u02bf\u0101n and their tendency toward metaphorical interpretation. \" Abu Zayd strongly opposed the belief in a \"single, precise and valid interpretation of the Qur'an handed down by the Prophet for all times\". In his view, the Quran made Islamic Arab culture a `culture of the text` (hadarat al-nass) par excellence, but because the language of the Quran is not self-explanatory, this implied Islamic Arab culture was also a culture of interpretation (hadarat al-ta'wil). Abu Zayd emphasized \"intellect\" (`aql) in understanding the Quran, as opposed to \"a hermeneutical approach which gives priority to the narrated traditions [ hadith ]\" (naql). As a reflection of this Abu Zaid used the term ta'wil (interpretation) for efforts to understand the Quran, while in the Islamic sciences, the literature that explained the Quran was referred to as tafsir (commentary, explanation). For Abu Zaid, interpretation goes beyond explanation or commentary, \"for without\" the Qur'an would not have meaning: The [Qur'anic] text changed from the very first moment - that is, when the Prophet recited it at the moment of its revelation - from its existence as a divine text (nass ilahi), and became something understandable, a human text (nass insani), because it changed from revelation to interpretation (li-annahu tahawwala min al-tanzil ila al-ta'wil). The Prophet's understanding of the text is one of the first phases of movement resulting from the text's connection with the human intellect. From the beginning of his academic career, Abu Zaid developed a renewed hermeneutic view (the theory and methodology of text interpretation) of the Qur'an and further Islamic holy texts, arguing that they should be interpreted in the historical and cultural context of their time. The mistake of many Muslim scholars was \"to see the Qur'an only as a text, which led conservatives as well as liberals to a battle of quotations, each group seeing clear verses (when on their side) and ambiguous ones (when in contradiction with their vision)\". But this type of controversy led both conservatives and liberals to produce authoritative hermeneutics. This vision of the Qur'an as a text was the vision of the elites of Muslim societies, whereas, at the same time, the Qur'an as \"an oral discourse\" played the most important part in the understanding of the masses. Nasr Abu Zayd called for another reading of the holy book through a \"humanistic hermeneutics\", an interpretation which sees the Qur'an as a living phenomenon, a discourse. Hence, the Qur'an can be \"the outcome of dialogue, debate, despite argument, acceptance and rejection\". This liberal interpretation of Islam should open space for new perspectives on the religion and social change in Muslim societies. Abu Zayd's analysis finds several \"insistent calls for social justice\" in the Qur'an . One example is when Muhammad\u2014busy preaching to the rich people of Quraysh\u2014failed to pay attention to a poor blind fellow named Ibn Umm Makt\u016bm who came asking the Prophet for advice. The Quran strongly criticizes Muhammad's attitude. (Quran 80:10) Abu Zayd also argued that while the Qur'anic discourse was built in a patriarchal society, and therefore the addressees were naturally males, who received permission to marry, divorce, and marry off their female relatives, it is \"possible to imagine that Muslim women receive the same rights\", and so the Quran had a \"tendency to improve women's rights\". The classical position of the modern 'ulam\u0101' about that issue is understandable as \"they still believe in superiority of the male in the family\". Abu Zayd's critical approach to classical and contemporary Islamic discourse in the fields of theology, philosophy, law, politics, and humanism, promoted modern Islamic thought that might enable Muslims to build a bridge between their own tradition and the modern world of freedom of speech, equality (minority rights, women's rights, social justice), human rights, democracy and globalisation. Abu Zayd has authored at least fourteen books in Arabic, including works on the Mu\u02bftazila, Ibn Arabi, Al-Shafi'i, and Qur\u02bfanic criticism, as well as books in English and articles in both languages.

He worked as a tag team wrestler for most of his career, primarily as part of The Backseat Boyz with Johnny Kashmere, in several American independent promotions, including Combat Zone Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Unplugged, National Wrestling Superstars, also known as NWS based out of New Jersey and Ring of Honor. He also worked a singles career with several promotions, including Juggalo Championship Wrestling. Verdi was childhood friends with Rocky Ciarrocchi (better known as fellow wrestler Hellter Skelter). Acid wrestled at the age of 14. Wrestled in independent promotions only in Philadelphia and New Jersey. Acid debuted in Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in 1999 and competed mostly in singles matches. At the first Cage of Death, he teamed with White Lotus to face the Kashmerinoes (Johnny Kashmere and Robbie Mireno). Acid wrestled many matches against Kashmere before teaming up with him to form The Backseat Boyz. The Backseat Boyz won the CZW Tag Team Championship. While part of this team, Acid still wrestled in the singles division and won the CZW World Junior Heavyweight Championship three times, competing against the likes of Ruckus and Justice Pain for the title. He also became the second Best of the Best winner by defeating Jody Fleisch in the final match at Best of the Best 2. In September 2003, Acid won the vacant CZW Iron Man Championship by defeating Nick Gage and Jimmy Rave in a three way match. Around this time, Acid, along with Johnny Kashmere, joined the Hi-V stable and feuded with Zandig and his ultraviolent team. This feud came to an end at Cage of Death V in the Cage of Death match. However, before competing in the Cage of Death match, Acid first had to defend his Iron Man Championship against Jimmy Rave. The match went to a time limit draw with each man scoring one fall, but the match was ordered to restart and Rave won the title. Acid went on to the Cage of Death but was eliminated and his team eventually lost. The Hi-V broke up after this and The Backseat Boyz soon left CZW. Acid returned to CZW later in 2004 and feuded with Teddy Hart and Messiah. He left again shortly after. On June 14, 2008, Acid made his return to CZW when he faced World Champion Nick Gage in a non-title match. At 'An Eye for an Eye' on April 11, 2009, Acid made his full-time return to CZW. It was the main event of the evening as Sami Callihan and Jon Moxley took on Brain Damage and Drake Younger. His last appearance for CZW was on October 10, 2009 as he lost to Greg Excellent at Served Ties. Acid joined Ring of Honor (ROH) in 2002, when he and Johnny Kashmere defeated Homicide and Steve Corino in an interpromotional match between ROH and CZW at the first Glory By Honor. The Backseat Boyz would go on to work for ROH permanently. They continued wrestling together and competed in many scramble matches against the likes of The SAT, The Carnage Crew and Special K. However, Acid is perhaps best known from ROH for his feud with Homicide which ended in a Fight Without Honor match on May 28, 2003, at Wrestlerave 03 which Acid would win. After this feud, The Backseat Boyz won the ROH Tag Team Championship by defeating Special K in the final round of a gauntlet match for the vacant title. This made The Backseat Boyz the first team to win both the CZW and ROH Tag Team Championships. Acid and Kashmere lost the title to Special K at the next show. Later, Kashmere left ROH and Acid would continue as a singles wrestler. At ROH's Reborn: Completion, Acid fought with Jimmy Rave but he lost after Rave hit the Rave Clash on him. At Testing The Limit, he challenged Samoa Joe for the ROH World Championship, but did not win. He was also part of the Scramble Cage Melee main event in the scramble cage. Acid had his last ROH match at Final Battle 2004 against Jimmy Jacobs. After losing this match, he quit ROH. Acid joined Pro Wrestling Unplugged at its inception in 2004, eventually feuding with Homicide, 2 Cold Scorpio, and Devon Moore over the PWU World Heavyweight Title. In 2005, Trent feuded with his old friend and new rival, Hellter Skelter. The feud lasted a few months, starting with Hellter claiming that Trent turned his back on their friendship and made him the evil person he is today. After months of feuding, Acid defeated Skelter in a \"Philadelphia Street Fight\" match on August 20, 2005. The feud continued in 2007, with Hellter wanting a rematch, and recording disturbing promos on PWU Surge TV, calling out Acid and claiming he would \"carve [Acid's] flesh\". Finally on November 23, 2007, Acid accepted the rematch and lost to Skelter, who had outside help from Sunny. Acid made his return to PWU, following knee surgery, on March 16, 2008, at the event Haunted, wrestling Television Champion ZBarr to a time-limit draw. Since the departure of Tod Gordon, and subsequent handoff of sole ownership to tag-team partner Johnny Kashmere, Acid has been named co-owner of the company. Acid made a one night appearance for WWE on January 9, 2006 on Sunday Night Heat teaming with Bison Bravado as they lost to Rosey and Jamal. Acid debuted in Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW) in 2007 under the gimmick of an arrogant priest. Acid, the self-proclaimed \"Savior of JCW\", cut a promo against the Juggalo fanbase, the company, and Insane Clown Posse (real-life owners of JCW) in the first episode of SlamTV!. He continued to badmouth the company in the following weeks while having confrontations with several heroes. On the fourth episode, Acid won a 10 Man Battle Royal to become the number one contender for Corporal Robinson's JCW Heavyweight Championship. In their first match, Acid temporarily blinded Robinson with holy water, causing the referee to end the match. Two weeks later at West Side Wars, Acid pinned Robinson after using Robinson's championship belt as a weapon, becoming the new JCW Heavyweight Champion. Corporal Robinson received his rematch at East Side Wars in a Steel Cage match and regained the championship. At Bloodymania, Acid and The Young Alter Boys lost a Six Man Tag Team match against the team of Insane Clown Posse and Sabu. Acid returned to JCW at Bloodymania III, where he teamed with the Alter Boys (Tim, Tom, Terry, and Todd). The group lost to the Juggalo World Order (Corporal Robinson, Scott Hall, Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J, and Sid Vicious) in the main event. His last match in JCW was lost to 2 Tuff Tony at Oddball Bonanza in a barbed wire boards and baseball bats match on March 20, 2010. Acid also worked for the new promotion Pro Wrestling Syndicate where he had matches with Alex Shelley, Human Tornado, Danny Doring, Justin Credible and Sabu. On May 29, 2009, Acid won a four-way match to win the PWS Heavyweight Championship. Acid then wrestled for Fight The World Wrestling and National Wrestling Superstars. On April 2, 2010, Verdi was arrested for possession of heroin. This charge combined with other previous charges, which included possession of drug paraphernalia and public intoxication. On May 12 he was sentenced to a maximum of 23 months of confinement, in addition to court mandated rehab, after reaching a plea deal. He had another trial set for July 13. On the morning of June 18, 2010, Verdi was found dead at his Philadelphia home by his mother. It was later determined that he had died because of a drug overdose. At an ROH show in Buffalo, New York that night, ROH held a ten-bell salute to honor Verdi. At CZW Tournament of Death show on June 26 in Townsend, Delaware, CZW honored him with a ten bell salute before the show. On June 28, it was announced that a tribute show, Acid-Fest: A Tribute to Trent Acid would be taking place at The Arena in Philadelphia on July 10. The show featured several of Verdi's friends within professional wrestling along with some of his students from PWU, which raised over $7,000 for the Trent Acid Memorial Fund, helping his family with his funeral costs. During the event Verdi was inducted into the Hardcore Hall of Fame. Verdi was featured in the documentary Card Subject to Change, which documented the independent wrestling scene, primarily on the East Coast. Verdi talked candidly about his addiction and waking up three days after an overdose. He died before filming was completed, and the film was dedicated to his memory.

In 1969, Ada, who was 35 years old at the time, became the district administrator of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. This was the highest-ranking office in the Northern Mariana Islands at the time. Much of Ada's efforts as an administrator focused on the potential of air travel as a tool of economic growth in the Mariana Islands. He laid the groundwork for the modern Saipan International Airport by acting on the advice of airport consultant Leigh Fisher and accepting grants made available through the National Airport Airways Development Act. Ada spearheaded the creation of an \"airline technical committee,\" which promoted cooperation between the government and the private sector to promote the creation of the new airport. During this period, Ada established the Mariana Islands Airport Authority, which is now called the Commonwealth Ports Authority. Ada next became the deputy resident commissioner to the Northern Marianas Islands in 1976. He also served as the delegate for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands government to the South Pacific Commission, assistant district administrator, a member of the Saipan Municipal Congress, and a member of the Mariana Islands District Legislature. In 1978, the Northern Mariana Islands became a commonwealth in political union with the United States, resulting in a new constitution and an elected governor's office. In 1977, Carlos S. Camacho and Francisco Ada were elected the Northern Mariana Islands' first governor and lieutenant governor respectively. Governor Camacho would later call Ada \"a good man\" and \"very loyal\" during their tenure in office. Ada served as lieutenant governor, leaving office on January 11, 1982. He was succeeded as by Pedro Agulto Tenorio. Within the private sector, Ada worked as the general manager and vice president of Triple J Enterprises Inc. On October 14, 2002, former Governor Juan N. Babauta signed Saipan Local Law 13-10, which renamed Saipan International Airport as Francisco C. Ada/Saipan International Airport in honor of Ada. At the time of the signing former Governor Babauta praised Ada's contributions to the airport saying, \"There is no doubt that due to the Honorable Francisco C. Ada's tireless contributions in the planning, development and completion of the Saipan International Airport, the Commonwealth's economic future was forever transformed. \" The new, modern airport was dedicated and renamed in honor of Ada in 2005. Ada told the NMI media during the dedication ceremony, \"But the name was secondary to what the effort stands for, which is working together with the federal government [to achieve our goals]. \" Francisco Ada died on March 2, 2010, at Commonwealth Health Center in Garapan, Saipan, at the age of 75. Ada had suffered from a lengthy illness. He was survived by his wife, Ines Seman Ada, and their seven children, many of whom have held positions in CNMI public life. His children are - MaryLou Ada, former director of the former Commonwealth Development Authority; Eloise Furey, former member of the Northern Marianas College Board of Regents; Lillian Tenorio, an attorney; Esther Ada, internal auditor of the Northern Mariana Islands Retirement Fund; Frank C. Ada Jr. , chief of classification and compensation for the commonwealth's Office of Personnel Management; Dr. Norma Ada and Luciana Schubert. Ada received a state funeral, which is required for all top government officials, including governors and lieutenant governors, by the Constitution of the Northern Mariana Islands. Ada's son, Frank Ada Jr. , told the Saipan Tribune that a state funeral was \"fitting for what my father contributed to the government of the Northern Marianas and Micronesia. \" Lieutenant Governor Eloy Inos stated that Ada's state funeral was \"in recognition of his dedicated service to our people as our first lieutenant governor. \" Inos also ordered all American and Northern Mariana Islands flags lowered to half staff. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate adopted separate resolutions praising Ada's contributions to the political and social sectors of the Northern Mariana Islands since 1976, when it became a commonwealth. Ada's state funeral was held on Wednesday, March 10, 2010, at the Pedro P. Tenorio Multi-Purpose Center in Susupe, Saipan. The funeral was attended by four of the Northern Mariana Islands' governors - Carlos S. Camacho and his wife, former First Lady Lourdes Camacho; Pedro P. Tenorio, and his wife, Sophie; Juan N. Babauta and current governor Benigno Fitial. Other dignitaries included judges, mayors, Cabinet members and local officials. Ada left behind 16 Grandchildren, 1 Greatgranddaughter, seven children and his wife Ines. A very well known family in the Marianas, the Ada's continue to service the community, with Ada's grandchildren succeeding in off island competitions. Afterwards, a Roman Catholic Requiem Mass, officiated by Bishop Tomas Aguon Camacho of the Diocese of Chalan Kanoa, and nine priests was held at the Mount Carmel Cathedral in Chalan Kanoa. Burial took place at Chalan Kanoa Cemetery. "}, {"text": "Captain Aspy Adajania was an Ex-Serviceman (Army Infantry) known as a pioneer in the sport of Indian Amateur Boxing.

He played college football for Clemson University, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. He was drafted in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Chicago Bears of the NFL. Adams died unexpectedly in 2010 from a previously undetected heart condition. Adams was born in Greenwood, South Carolina. He attended Fork Union Military Academy in 2001 and recorded 58 tackles, 22 sacks, and two interceptions in 10 games. He was a three-year starter at Cambridge Academy, a small private school which only had an 8-man football team, where he was a dominant wide receiver and defensive end. His coach during high school was former University of South Carolina quarterback, Steve Taneyhill. In 2000, his team won the state title. During that year, Cambridge shut out four teams, beating one team 80\u20130. They had suffered only one loss that season to rival King Academy. He had 158 career receptions for 4,394 yard and 65 touchdowns, as well as 341 tackles, 10 interceptions, and 33 sacks in his career, and was a two-time All-state honoree. He chose Clemson over Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. He had narrowed down his choices to North Carolina and Clemson, then signed with Clemson after the Tar Heels unexpectedly rescinded their offer. At Cambridge, he was named to the Greenwood Touchdown Club/Index-Journal All-Lakelands Team (which included four counties). Adams attended Clemson University, and played for the Clemson Tigers football team from 2002 to 2006. He was redshirted in 2002. As a redshirt freshman in 2003, he did not see much action as the second-team defensive end, only totaling 15 tackles and a sack. In 2004, he had 35 tackles with 8 sacks, and two blocked punts playing on special teams. For his hard work on special teams, Adams was awarded the 12th Man Award for Clemson's defense. Adams considered coming out for the NFL Draft after his sophomore year, but after the underclassman panel gave him a conservatively low ranking he decided to stay for his junior year. Adams' 2005 junior season was a breakout year for him. He totaled 56 tackles, 9. 5 sacks, and forced three fumbles while starting at boundary defensive end. Before his senior year in 2006, he was slated to be among the best defensive ends in the college football. Adams lived up to his reputation by starting all 12 games, recording 12. 5 sacks, causing 2 fumbles and recovering 3. By the end of the 2006 season, Adams recorded a total of 28 career sacks, tying the school record set by Michael Dean Perry (1984\u20131987). In addition, Adams was named to all five All-America teams acknowledged by the NCAA in 2006, and was recognized as one of seven unanimous first-team All-Americans that year.

Adams' mother was from Kingston and his father from St. Vincent; the two met while working in Cura\u00e7ao. Adams' first break in the music business came as a teenager, when he appeared as a singer in a vocal group on Radio Jamaica's Opportunity Knocks show hosted by Vere Johns. Later performing on the same show as a solo singer which led to appearances on cabaret shows and performances in Kingston and St. Andrews at weekends. Adams' older sister Yvonne was also a popular singer and he was spotted by Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd while rehearsing a song that she had written called \"Wonder Thirst\". Coxsone took him into the Federal Recording Studio to record the track in 1960. Although not officially released as a single at the time, the song became a popular dub plate on sound systems, and the title of the song became his nickname. Adams formed a duo, Ken and Glen, with Ken Boothe and they came second place in the 1966 Festival Song Competition with \"I Remember\". The duo also backed Stranger Cole on his number one single \"Uno Dos Tres\". He co-founded The Heptones before moving on to The Pioneers, appearing on the latter's \"Shake It Up\" and \"Good Nanny\". While continuing to earn a living as a tailor, he moved on to work with Duke Reid's Treasure Isle set-up as an informal musical director, introducing singers such as Joe White to Reid. Adams also worked with Bunny Lee from around 1967 as a solo singer, backing singer and A&R man, in exchange for studio time. At a recording session in October 1968, when several musicians failed to turn up due to a dispute about payment for a previous session, Adams was asked to play piano, despite not being proficient on the instrument. Unhappy with the results, he switched instruments with organist Lloyd Charmers (although he had never played the organ before). He played organ on eight tracks in that session, which included Lester Sterling's \"Bangarang\" and Slim Smith's \"Everybody Needs Love\" and he has stuck with the instrument ever since, becoming a regular session player. Along with other musicians such as the Barrett brothers (Aston and Carlton), he performed in sessions for a range of producers under a variety of group names notably The Hippy Boys for Bunny Lee, where Adams did some of his most memorable work accompanying Slim Smith, The Reggae Boys and The Upsetters for Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. Adams also worked for Herman Chin Loy, where he was one of a number of keyboard players to record under the name Augustus Pablo, before Horace Swaby adopted that identity. Perry and The Upsetters toured the United Kingdom to capitalise on the success of Perry's hit \"Return of Django\" (and the less successful follow-up, \"Live Injection\"); returning to Jamaica in 1970. As part of The Upsetters, Adams backed The Wailers during their spell with Perry and Adams did much of the arranging and composed the song \"Mr. Brown\". The lyrics were inspired by a local tale about a duppy who was supposedly seen speeding around on a three-wheeled coffin with two \"John Crows\" (buzzards) on top, one of which would ask for \"Mr. Brown\". Adams was due to record the track himself but Perry suggested that the Wailers record it, with Peter Tosh and Adams adding spooky organ riffs. Adams regularly introduced this song at his concerts with the statement: \"I wrote this song for Bob Marley\". When The Wailers parted company with Perry in 1971 taking The Upsetter's rhythm section with them, Adams remained with Perry. During this period he had also started to split his time between Jamaica and the United States. In the United States he set up his own Capo record label and put together a new band, the Blue Grass Experience. He eventually moved to Brooklyn permanently in 1975, where he became more involved in producing and also worked for Brad Osbourne's Clocktower and Lloyd Barnes' Bullwackie labels and played with The Realistics band. In the late 1970s, Adams expanded into R&B and Rap production, working with hip hop artist T Ski Valley. He also worked with Shaggy and remixed and re-voiced an album of partly Upsetters material in 1996, released by Heartbeat Records as Upsetters a Go Go. After many years in the studio, Adams returned to live performance in the 2000s, touring the USA and Europe with The Slackers and also playing occasional NYC shows with the Jammyland All-Stars. Adams owned his own recording studio and in his later years produced artists such as Susan Cadogan and Keith Rowe, half of the vocal duo Keith & Tex from Jamaica.

Adams was born in Montrose, Scotland to Maggie and John Ritchie. Her father was a railway foreman. Her parents moved to Stonehaven where she attended Mackie Academy before going on to take a job as a clerk in solicitors' office. In 1943 she signed up for the Auxiliary Territorial Service and was selected for the Royal Corps of Signals, where she was trained in receiving Morse code. She was then assigned to Bletchley Park as an interceptor of German and Italian coded signals. Adams stated that she preferred to intercept Italian signals as Italians were often excitable when transmitting which lead them to make mistakes causing them to repeat their messages, and thereby giving her a second chance to capture their messages. Having signed the Official Secrets Act, Adams did not talk to anyone, not even her husband, about her work during the war. When MI6 officer Frederick Winterbotham published his book The Ultra Secret in 1974, she then felt able to mention her work. Adams married Bob Adams, an accountant, in 1950. They had three children, Bob, David and Lorna. After the war Adams trained as a radiographer at Manchester Royal Infirmary. After her children were born she worked as a volunteer at the Citizens' Advice Bureau, going on to work as trainer and tutor at its Edinburgh offices. In 2009 Adams was presented with the Bletchley Park Commemorative Badge in recognition of her role during the war.

Wood and sentenced to death. His conviction was overturned in 1989. Throughout his legal ordeal, Adams maintained his innocence. He insisted that the man he believed to be Wood's killer, David Ray Harris, had offered him a ride on the day of the shooting after his own car had run out of gasoline. Adams and Harris had spent several hours together but had parted ways prior to the shooting. Under an immunity agreement, Harris testified for the prosecution that Adams was the shooter of Officer Wood while he was the passenger. Based on the testimony of Harris and other alleged eyewitnesses, Adams was found guilty by a Dallas County jury and imprisoned on death row. In 1980, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. While incarcerated for the crime, Adams was the subject of the 1988 documentary film The Thin Blue Line, which was cited as being instrumental in his exoneration the following year. Writer\u2013director Errol Morris knew that Harris had, on multiple occasions, bragged about shooting a police officer. He later uncovered evidence of prosecutorial misconduct and eyewitness misidentification. During an interview with Harris, Morris was able to record audio of him giving a pseudo-confession to the Wood murder. In 2004, Harris was executed by lethal injection for an unrelated 1985 murder. He was never charged with Robert Wood's murder. Six months after the film's release, Adams' conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and prosecutors declined to re-try the case. Adams received no compensation from the State of Texas for the 12 years he spent in prison. He died of a brain tumor on October 30, 2010, in Washington Court House, Ohio. Adams was born in Grove City, Ohio, the youngest of five children of a woman named Mildred and a miner who died of coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Adams graduated from high school in 1967, and spent three years as a U. S. Army paratrooper. In October 1976, 27-year-old Randall Adams and his brother left Ohio for California. En route, they arrived in Dallas on Thanksgiving night. The next morning, Adams was offered a contracting job. On the following Saturday, November 27, Adams went to start work but no one turned up because it was a weekend. On the way home, his car ran out of fuel. David Ray Harris, who had just turned sixteen, passed Adams in a car that he had stolen from his neighbor in Vidor, Texas, before driving to Dallas with his father's pistol and a shotgun. Harris offered Adams a ride. The two spent the day together, during which they drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. That evening they went to a drive-in movie, where they saw The Student Body (1976, directed by Gus Trikonis) and The Swinging Cheerleaders (1974, directed by Jack Hill). That evening, Robert W. Wood, a Dallas police officer, was working the graveyard shift with his partner, Teresa Turko, one of the first female police officers in Dallas to be assigned to patrol duty. Shortly after midnight on November 28, Wood stopped Harris' stolen car in the 3400 block of North Hampton Road because the car's headlights were not on. As Wood approached, he was shot twice in the forearm and chest by someone in the car. The vehicle sped off almost immediately after the shooting, giving Wood's partner little time to react; she later testified that she managed to fire upon the fleeing vehicle but to no avail. The Dallas Police Department investigation led back to Harris, who, after returning to Vidor, had boasted to friends that he was responsible for the crime. Harris was arrested but, when interviewed by police, accused Adams of the murder. Harris led police to the car driven from the scene of the crime, as well as to a . 22 Short caliber revolver he identified as the murder weapon. Dallas prosecutor Douglas D. Mulder charged Adams with the crime, despite the evidence against Harris, apparently because Harris was a juvenile at the time and Adams, as an adult, could be sentenced to death under Texas law. Adams testified that after leaving the drive-in movie, Harris dropped Adams off at his motel, where Adams and his brother watched TV and then went to sleep. He claimed he was not in the car when the shooting happened. Harris testified that Adams was not only in the car, but was the driver, as well as the shooter of Officer Wood. Testimony by Harris and several questionable eyewitnesses \u2013 including Emily Miller and R. L. Miller, who claimed to have driven past Harris' stopped vehicle immediately before the shooting \u2013 led to Adams' conviction. Texas forensic psychiatrist James Grigson (a. k. a. \"Dr. Death\") was also a witness for the prosecution. Having administered a psychiatric evaluation of Adams, he told the jury that Adams would be an ongoing menace if kept alive. As a result of this testimony, Adams was given the death penalty. His conviction was unanimously upheld by the Texas Courts of Appeals in 1979. Many years later, in 1995, Grigson was expelled by the American Psychiatric Association and the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians for unethical conduct. Adams' execution was originally scheduled for May 8, 1979, but U. S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. ordered a stay only three days before the scheduled date. In 1980, the Supreme Court on an 8\u20131 vote ruled unconstitutional a Texas requirement for jurors to swear an oath that the mandatory imposition of a death sentence would not interfere with their consideration of factual matters, such as guilt or innocence, during a trial. As a result of the decision, Adams' death sentence was reversed and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted him a new trial. Before the trial could begin, however, Texas Governor Bill Clements commuted Adams' sentence to life in prison at the request of the Dallas County District Attorney. In May 1988, David Ray Harris, by that point himself a prisoner on death row, admitted that Adams was not even in the car on the night of the murder. The August 1988 release of the documentary film The Thin Blue Line, which detailed the many inconsistencies in the prosecution's line of reasoning, further cast doubt on Adams' guilt, but the case remained in legal limbo. In 1989, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Ex parte Adams overturned Adams' conviction on the grounds of malfeasance by the prosecutor Douglas D. Mulder and inconsistencies in the testimony of a key witness, Emily Miller. The appeals court found that prosecutor Mulder withheld a statement by Emily Miller to the police that cast doubt on her credibility and also allowed her to give perjured testimony. Furthermore, the court found that after Adams' attorney discovered the statement late in Adams' trial, Mulder falsely told the court that he did not know the witness' whereabouts. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stated that \"conviction was unfair mainly because of prosecutor Doug Mulder. \" Mulder had returned to practicing private law in Dallas in 1981. Following the appeals court decision, the case was returned to Dallas County for a retrial, but the district attorney's office decided not to prosecute the case again based on the length of time since the original crime, and Adams was subsequently released. Despite being wrongly imprisoned for twelve years, Adams received no compensation from the State of Texas. It is said that if Adams had been found to be wrongly convicted under present-day Texas law, he would be entitled to receive $80,000 for each year of incarceration. Additionally, at the time his conviction was thrown out, wrongly convicted prisoners could get a lump sum payment of $25,000 if pardoned by the governor. However, since Adams was released because his case was dismissed, and not because he was pardoned, he received no payment from the state after his release. David Ray Harris had testified in the original trial that he was the passenger in the stolen car, that he allowed Adams to drive, and that Adams committed the murder. He recanted this testimony at Adams' habeas corpus hearing, but never admitted guilt in a judicial setting and was never charged in the case. On June 30, 2004, Harris was executed by lethal injection for the unrelated 1985 murder of Mark Mays in Beaumont, Texas, which occurred during an attempted abduction of Mays' girlfriend. After his release from prison, Adams ended up in a legal battle with Errol Morris, the director of The Thin Blue Line, concerning the rights to his story. The matter was settled out of court after Adams was granted sole use of anything written or made on the subject of his life. Adams said of the matter: \"Mr. Morris felt he had the exclusive rights to my life story. . . . I did not sue Errol Morris for any money or any percentages of The Thin Blue Line, though the media portrayed it that way. \"Morris, for his part, recalled: \"When he got out, he became very angry at the fact that he had signed a release giving me rights to his life story. And he felt as though I had stolen something from him. Maybe I had, maybe I just don't understand what it's like to be in prison for that long, for a crime you hadn't committed. In a certain sense, the whole crazy deal with the release was fueled by my relationship with his attorney. And it's a long, complicated story, but I guess when people are involved, there's always a mess somewhere. \" While in prison, Adams earned a correspondence-course degree from Lee College in Baytown, Texas. Adams later worked as an anti-death penalty activist. He wrote a book about his story, Adams v. Texas, which was published in June 1992. In 2001, at an anti-death penalty legislative hearing on behalf of the Texas Moratorium Network, Adams said:The man you see before you is here by the grace of God. The fact that it took 12-and-a-half years and a movie to prove my innocence should scare the hell out of everyone in this room and, if it doesn't, then that scares the hell out of me.

Among those she managed were Brian Christopher, Scotty Flamingo, Koko B. Ware, Tony Falk, Rod Price and Iceman Parsons. Toni Lea Collins was born in Freer, Texas and began working in Fritz Von Erich's World Class Championship Wrestling as an assistant to the production staff in 1984. Meeting Chris Adams while working in the promotion, the two were married in Hawaii. Adams's appearances on World Class television were sporadic, however she made one memorable appearance in a 1986 interview where she was helping husband Chris (with his eyes bandaged selling his blinding injury) into his Corvette to drive to the airport en route to England. Adams again appeared in another interview between Chris and announcer Bill Mercer two months later, as he continued selling his eye injury (with vision restored to his right eye, but not to his left). Following her husband to the Mid-South area, she soon appeared in an on-camera role for Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation interviewing wrestlers and fans. Upon Chris' return to World Class in late-1987 she appeared as one of the ringside ladies. Adams eventually made her managerial debut appearing with Chris in World Class Championship Wrestling in 1989. Soon after, she along with ring announcer Frank Dusek were attacked by Tojo Yamamoto & Phil Hickerson, billed as P. Y. Chu-Hi. While held by Chu-Hi, Yamamoto ripped open her blouse before Chris came out from the locker room to chase them off. As the feud continued for several weeks, Adams began carrying kendo sticks to the ring and used them against Yamamoto & Hickerson during matches against Chris. After the conclusion of this feud, she and Chris would become involved in another feud with Billy Travis and, at one point, was spanked by Travis in the middle of the Dallas Sportatorium while Chris was handcuffed to the ring rope. During this time, she would run a summer camp as well as co-manage Chris's wrestling school during the late 1980s (under the brand name Chris Adams Promotions). The two would also be in attendance at the National Association of Television Programming Executives at the New Orleans Convention Center in New Orleans, Louisiana in January 1990 along with other television celebrities such as Vanna White, Alex Trebek, Geraldo Riviera, Oprah Winfrey, Sally Jessy Raphael and Donald Trump. Returning with Chris to the United States Wrestling Association in May 1990, she would become involved in a storyline in which Chris began feuding with former protege Steve Austin. The feud, which Chris created and developed, would later involve her and Chris's former girlfriend Jeanie Clarke (billed as Chris' \"ex-wife\"), who eventually married Steve Austin, and faced each other in mixed tag team matches for much of the year in one of the most memorable feuds in the region. As Chris's drinking problem became out of control, particularly one incident in which he had assaulted Adams in February 1989 for which he was sentenced to one year's probation, Adams would divorce Chris soon after the feud, which occurred sometime around 1991. The couple shared one son, Christopher Adams Jr. , born in late 1988. In late 1993, she returned to the USWA, losing to Rockin' Robin at the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee on September 13, 1993. Managing Brian Christopher as Nanny Simpson, she participated in several mixed tag team matches with him against Koko B. Ware and Miss Texas during the next several weeks eventually pinning Miss Texas on October 18. However, she lost to Miss Texas and Sweet Georgia Brown in a tag team match with Vicious Viki on November 1 and, a week later, lost to Miss Texas in a \"chain match\" by disqualification on November 8. The following month she feuded with Dirty White Girl losing to her at the November Blast supercard by disqualification on November 18 and in a \"street fight\" match several days later. During that same event, she was forced to eat dog food as a result of a stipulation in which Jerry Lawler and Brian Christopher defeated Rex Hargrove & Koko B. Ware. Briefly managing Eddie Gilbert before his feud with Jerry Lawler, she later resurfaced in the Global Wrestling Federation as part of Skandor Akbar's Devastation, Inc. and later as the valet of Iceman King Parsons during his feud with Chris Adams until the promotion's close. Adams retired around 1995, remaining out of the spotlight permanently. She would eventually marry two more times during the final 15 years of her life. Adams, now known as Toni Gant, was hospitalized in June 2010 due to an abscess in her abdomen. She was hospitalized again in full cardiac arrest in late June, and died on June 24, 2010 at the age of 45. At the time of her death she was engaged to Leonard Donahoo. She was survived by three sisters, son Chris Adams Jr, daughter Tori Gant, and one grandchild.

Adelman\u2019s most prominent works include book-length critiques of William Shakespeare\u2019s plays presenting new psychoanalytic and feminist readings of Antony and Cleopatra and The Merchant of Venice in \"The Common Liar: An Essay on 'Antony & Cleopatra'\" (1973) and Blood Relations: Christian and Jew in 'The Merchant of Venice' (2008), respectively. Adelman authored another book, Suffocating Mothers: Fantasies of Maternal Origins in Shakespeare\u2019s Plays, Hamlet to the Tempest, (1992) that discusses maternal characters over many of Shakespeare\u2019s works. Adelman was born in Mt. Kisco, New York, on January 28, 1941. She earned a B. A. degree in English and graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1962. She then attended St Hugh's College, Oxford in England the following year supported by a Fulbright Fellowship. She received a master's degree in English from Yale University in 1966 and a Ph. D. in English from Yale three years later in 1969. \"Her husband of 33 years, Robert Osserman, said Adelman loved the theater, nature, bird watching and taking walks in nearby Tilden Regional Park. \" Her two sons, Brian Osserman and Stephen Osserman live in Woodland, CA and Portland, OR, respectively. Janet's brother Howard Adelman also lives in Bethel, CN. Adelman joined the University of California, Berkeley's English department as an acting assistant professor in 1968 (also one of the first women to join the department faculty), earned tenure in 1972, and became a full professor in 1981. She eventually served as the department's chair from 1999 to 2002 and retired in 2007. In the early 1970s, Adelman taught a popular \"Shakespeare for non-majors\" undergraduate course at U. C. Berkeley. Her professional statement, though no longer posted on the UC Berkeley English Department's faculty contact page, can still be found online: \"My dominant interests are in psychoanalysis, gender, and race, usually practiced somewhere in proximity to Shakespeare, although I have been planning a long essay on Toni Morrison for some time. At the moment I am writing a book about issues of conversion, race, identity, and blood as they inflect the anxiety-fraught relation of Christian to Jew in 'The Merchant of Venice' and elsewhere in the culture. \" And her areas of interest were also listed as: \"English Renaissance Literature 1500-1660. Gender & Sexuality Studies. Drama. \"\"Adelman belonged to the Modern Language Association and Shakespeare Association of America. She also was an interdisciplinary member of the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Society and Institute. Adelman was also associated with the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations and the Anna Freud Centre, both in London. \"In Berkeley, \"Adelman loved the theater and participated actively in the Center for Theater Arts, on whose advisory board she served from 1996 to 1997. After her appointment to a University committee to revamp the theater, dance, and performance studies program, she worked to design a suitable Ph. D. program. She served on both the graduate admissions and faculty appointments committees of what became the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, and she became the dissertation director for four Ph. D. students. She served the University in numerous other capacities, among them as a member of the Reading and Composition Task Force from 2006-2007, and a participant in the search for a dean of humanities in 2005. \"Adelman's other passions included Italian culture. She spent the summers of 1972 and 1973 in Perugia studying Italian language and literature. She received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to the Bellagio Study Center in 1998, and a Bogliasco Foundation fellowship to the Liguria Study Center in 2003. For a number of years, she and her husband spent several months annually in an apartment they rented in Rome. She became fluent in Italian, watched Italian movies, and shopped at their local outdoor market. An active member of Kehilla Community Synagogue in Piedmont, CA, Adelman chaired several committees there. She studied biblical Hebrew at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley and was preparing to teach a course at Kehilla on traditional liturgy before she died. In \"The Common Liar: An Essay on 'Antony and Cleopatra,'\" Adelman provides critical analysis on Shakespeare's tragedy from the roles and persona of the characters to the psychological and mystical matters. The play\u2019s historical accuracy in terms of timeline and relationship between characters also creates confusion for readers of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, and critics find that Adelman\u2019s book \u201cis a courageous and stimulating attempt to come to grips with the play\u2019s complexities. \"Adelman\u2019s book addresses three sections of \"Antony and Cleopatra\": the uncertainty caused by the unreliability of historical information found in the text, the differences of background and tradition \u2013 \u201ca tradition which emanates chiefly from Renaissance understanding of Dido and Aeneas, and of Mars and Venus myths\u201d \u2013 and the use of poetry and language Shakespeare uses in the play. Her book ultimately connects the history of Antony and Cleopatra with the events depicted in Shakespeare\u2019s play, and investigates how Shakespeare portrays the story, in terms of his use of language and character development. With her dominant interests in psychoanalysis, gender, and race, Adelman writes Suffocating Mothers, exploring the depiction of females in Shakespeare\u2019s works and the dominating effects of the maternal identity over the masculine characters. In short, the focus is on \u201cthe nightmare of femaleness that can weaken and contaminate masculinity. \" In Shakespeare\u2019s plays, it is often seen that the maternal body has been seen to contaminate both the father and the son. Adelman\u2019s book focuses on a handful of Shakespeare\u2019s works: Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, Othello, All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, King Lear, Macbeth, Coriolanus, Timon of Athens, and Antony and Cleopatra. Adelman focuses on either the role of the maternal figure of the play or the lack of one, and the effects on the male characters. Hamlet\u2019s view is affected with the role of his mother as the adulterous female, and in Othello, the male imagination is corrupted with the idea of female betrayal. Even in \"King Lear\", with the absence of a mother in the play, females take on the dominant role over King Lear, the presence threatening \u201cto overwhelm male authority and selfhood. \" Adelman\u2019s Suffocating Mothers goes deeper into her psychoanalysis of Shakespeare\u2019s maternal characters, emphasizing the effects of the image of the corrupt mother and female on the male identity and the masculinity of the characters. In a religious reading of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Adelman focuses on Shakespeare's unique representation of the historical conflict between Christianity and Judaism during the time. Shylock is the principal Jewish character along with his family including Jessica, his daughter, who elopes with Lorenzo and converts to Christianity. Adelman points out the great significance in both Jessica's and Shylock's eventual conversions to Christianity. Adelman analyzes the significance of Jessica's leave and deceit of her father in the context of Jewish cultural history. She approaches the work as she becomes increasingly informed about her religious traditions by attending the Kehilla Community Synagogue in Piedmont, CA.

In his student days in the late 1930s Adeney worked with Vaughan Williams and Sir Malcolm Sargent. In the Second World War he was unconditionally exempted from military service as a conscientious objector. He joined the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1941, initially as second flute, and played with them until 1950 and again from 1961 to 1970, under such conductors as Henry Wood and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. He was one of the founding members of the Melos Ensemble, principal flautist of the English Chamber Orchestra (ECO) until the 1970s when he was succeeded by William Bennett, and also regularly performed as a soloist. Malcolm Arnold composed a Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet for him and other particular friends. Richard Adeney, Sidney Sutcliffe and Stephen Waters gave the work its first performance in 1952. In 1954 Malcolm Arnold wrote a Concerto for Flute and Strings for his friend, who recorded it in 1979, together with the concerto for flute and orchestra (1972). Richard Adeney was closely associated with Benjamin Britten, and performed in many performances and recordings of the composer's works, notably in 1962 with the Melos Ensemble in the premiere and recording of the War Requiem that Britten conducted himself.

Aderholt died on 20 May 2010. Aderholt was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1920. He entered active military duty through the aviation cadet program in April 1942 and graduated from pilot training with a commission as a second lieutenant in the U. S. Army Air Corps in May 1943. During World War II, from October 1943 to August 1945, Aderholt served in North Africa and Italy as a B-17 and C-47 pilot. In September 1945 Aderholt went to Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, assigned as a staff pilot with the Army Air Forces Eastern Flying Training Command. After completion of Air Tactical School at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, in December 1948, Aderholt returned to Maxwell and served as a flight instructor and flying safety officer with the 3800th Air Base Wing. During the Korean War, from July 1950 to September 1951, Aderholt commanded a Special Air Warfare Detachment of the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron. He next was assigned as an operations staff officer with the 1007th Air Intelligence Service Group in Washington, D. C. In June 1953 he was transferred to Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina, where he served with Headquarters Eighteenth Air Force as tactical and operations staff officer in the Directorate of Operations and Training. In October 1954, Aderholt was assigned to Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe, Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany, and served in the Directorate of Plans as an unconventional warfare planning staff officer. In September 1957 Aderholt returned to Washington, D. C. , assigned to the 1007th Air Intelligence Service Group as a special warfare staff officer, and in September 1959 joined the 1040th United States Air Force Field Activity Squadron in the same capacity. Aderholt left for Okinawa in January 1960 where he became commander of the 1095th Operational Evaluation Training Group. During this assignment, he contributed to the pioneering of special air warfare techniques, and was instrumental in developing the Laos airfield complex known as Lima sites. These fields were used throughout Southeast Asia as support sites for special warfare operations and as CH-3 \"Jolly Green\" helicopter forward staging bases for rescue and recovery operations in Laos and North Vietnam. From August 1962 to February 1964, Aderholt served as special advisor to the commander of the United States Air Force Special Air Warfare Center (SAWC) at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. During this period, he contributed to and participated in RAND Corporation studies which resulted in the publication of the Single Integrated Attack Team Study. He then was transferred to Hurlburt Field, Florida, (Eglin Auxiliary Field 9) where he served as vice commander and commander of the famed 1st Air Commando Wing.

He then was selected by Headquarters Pacific Air Forces to activate the 56th Air Commando Wing at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. This wing, which he organized and commanded from December 1966 to December 1967, conducted low-level night interdiction missions over the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos and North Vietnam, using prop-driven aircraft. The efforts of this wing were so successful in slowing infiltration that the enemy reacted by greatly increasing anti-aircraft defenses and committing a large amount of his total assets to keep the trail open. In January 1968 Aderholt was reassigned to the United States Air Force Special Air Warfare Center, later redesignated United States Air Force Special Operations Force (SOF), at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to serve as deputy chief of staff for operations. Aderholt returned to Thailand in June 1970 for a two-year tour of duty as chief of the Air Force Advisory Group, Joint United States Military Advisory Group, in Bangkok.

Aderholt became commander, USMACTHAI, and chief, JUSMAG, Thailand, in May 1975. One of Aderholt's prouder moments was his assistance in evacuating Hmong leaders from Laos as the Pathet Lao communist army advanced on their base at Long Tieng in May 1975. The United States by that time had withdrawn all its civilian and military personnel from Indochina, except for a few Embassy personnel in Laos. Aderholt was the last American general on the ground in Southeast Asia. He had few resources. Aderholt was informed that help was needed to evacuate the Hmong who for more than a decade had comprised the \"secret army\" in Laos assisting the United States in fending off the North Vietnamese Army in the Lao Civil War. He located one American C-130 (leaving star and bar marking) transport aircraft and two CASI C-46 aircraft and pilots in Thailand. He had the planes \"sheep dipped\" to remove all markings identifying them as American-owned and sent them to Long Tieng. In four days of intense activity, the transport planes evacuated more than 2,000 Hmong, including General Vang Pao and Jerry Daniels, his CIA case officer. During the last few years of his life, from 2002 until 2010, Aderholt was directly involved with the Thailand Laos Cambodia Brotherhood as a member of the TLC Assistance Committee working to raise many thousands of dollars of funds and also made several trips back to Northeast Thailand and Laos hands on involved with humanitarian aid. The TLC Brotherhood has dedicated an assistance project in his memory and many of the members of the TLC Brotherhood served at Nakhon Phanom at all phases. His military decorations and awards include the Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, Bronze Star Medal with oak leaf cluster, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal with eight oak leaf clusters, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, Presidential Unit Citation Emblem, and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award Ribbon with oak leaf cluster.

He was a co-founder and chairman of the Thai Nation Party, deputy prime minister and minister in several cabinets. Pramarn Adireksarn was born on 31 December 1913 in Saraburi to a Chinese immigrant father and Thai mother. He attended the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy and became an officer in the artillery of the Royal Thai Army in Lopburi. The highest rank he achieved was Major General. Pramarn married Charoen Choonhavan, the daughter of Field Marshal Phin Choonhavan and sister of Chatichai Choonhavan. By this marriage, he became a member of the influential \"Rajakru clan\". Pramarn and Charoen Adireksarn had three sons, including the author and politician Pongpol Adireksarn (pen-name Paul Adirex). Later he served as director of the state-run Express Transportation Organization of Thailand (ETO). In 1951 he became deputy minister in the cabinet of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, initially assigned to the ministry of transport, he changed to the interior ministry in 1952, and to the ministry of industry in 1953. In 1955 he left the government. In 1957, Pramarn was elected Member of Parliament for the ruling Seri Manangkasila Party, the winner of the election in February of that year. Subsequently, Prime Minister Plaek appointed him Minister of Industry. The 1957 military coup d'\u00e9tat by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat deposed Pramarn's patron Plaek and brought his political career to a temporary halt. He got involved in the private sector and established a textile concern. In 1974, after the successful democratic uprising, Pramarn, together with his in-laws Chatichai Choonhavan and Siri Siriyothin, founded the Thai Nation Party. The right-wing conservative and staunchly anti-communist party was the adversary of the leftist student movement. In March 1975, Pramarn led the Thai Nation Party into a United Parties coalition with the progressive Social Action Party and the right-wing Social Justice Party with M. R. Kukrit Pramoj becoming Prime Minister and Pramarn taking the office of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. The coalition broke in January 1976. It had not been able to cope with the social unrest in the country, including the protests of the students movement, strikes, and fear at the sight of the events in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and inter-party conflicts, namely between Pramarn and Thawit Klinprathum, the leader of the Social Justice Party. In advance of the snap elections, Pramarn's Thai Nation Party campaigned on the slogan \"Right kill Left\". The party could significantly increase its share of votes and seats in parliament. This time, the Thai Nation Party joined a Democrat Party-led government under Kukrit's brother M. R. Seni Pramoj. Pramarn Adireksarn stayed Deputy Prime Minister, but was denied the defence portfolio. Instead, he was given the ministry of agriculture. In the morning of 6 October 1976, it was Pramarn who declared in a cabinet meeting that it was the right moment to destroy the student movement. This was eventually executed by the police and ultra-right paramilitary units who shot and struck at least 46 protesters at the Thammasat University dead. On the evening of the same day, the military launched a coup d'\u00e9tat and deposed the Seni government. In 1978, Pramarn became official leader of the opposition, before Thai Nation joined the coalition government of General Prem Tinsulanonda in 1980, with Pramarn again becoming Deputy Prime Minister. In 1986, Pramarn passed the leadership of the Thai Nation Party to his brother-in-law Chatichai Choonhavan. Chatichai won the election of 1988, became Prime Minister and made Pramarn Minister of Interior. In this position, he was royally promoted to the honorary rank of police general. In January 1990 he switched posts with fellow party member Banharn Silpa-archa and took over the industry portfolio, just to change back to the interior ministry in December of the same year. Chatichai however took on leading circles in the military and was deposed by a coup in 1991. The so-called National Peace Keeping Council seized 139 million baht of Pramarn's assets, accusing him of being \"unusually rich\" for a cabinet member. From 1992 to 1994 Pramarn once again assumed the leadership of the Thai Nation Party and acted as leader of the opposition. Afterwards, Pramarn retired from the political scene and passed the mantle to his son Pongpol Adireksarn. Pramarn Adireksarn died of a blood infection at the age of 96 on 20 August 2010.

Kathleen Gemberling Adkison was born in Beatrice, Nebraska, to parents Rupert Parks and Henrietta Williamson. She attended Hawthorn High School in Kearney, Nebraska for three years, and graduated from Garfield High School in Seattle, Washington. She studied art and painting under Leon Derbyshire at the Cornish Institute between 1938 and 1942. Adkison was the last surviving artist trained under Mark Tobey, who was Jackson Pollock's inspiration, and was considered one of the Northwest's premier female artists. Her work has been shown in museums as early as 1960 when the Frye Art Museum staged a solo show of her work. She also had a show at the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture, formerly the Cheney Cowles Memorial Museum, in Spokane, Washington, from December 13, 1973 to January 13, 1974. Like Jackson Pollock, Adkison worked with her canvas on the floor. She is recognized as among the first female to do so. However, her focus is based on the natural beauty of rocks, trees, tall grasses and other images she perceived from her hikes with her husband. Adkison was a critically acclaimed artist and highly recognized for her work. She was among only eight women included in Northwest Art Today at the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. She died in August 2010. Kathleen Gemberling Adkinson was the feature of a solo retrospective at the Cheney Cowles Museum, in Spokane, Washington from March 27, 1999 to June 27, 1999.

Adler was born in Baltimore, and early in his childhood mastered the harmonica, winning a local talent contest sponsored by the Baltimore Evening Sun at age 13. His older brother Larry Adler, four years his senior, had won the same contest five years earlier, performing the same piece, Beethoven's Minuet in G. Later, Adler found work with Paul Whiteman and performed regularly with his orchestra. After starting his solo career, he joined the Army Air Corps, where he did theater and film work in the entertainment division. Adler focused on popular music as his career developed, and he soloed in numerous film soundtracks from the 1940s to the 1960s, including Shane, High Noon, Mary Poppins, and My Fair Lady. He also taught actors how to pretend to play the instrument convincingly where their on-screen performances required. He published an autobiography, Living from Hand to Mouth, in 2005. Jerry Adler died of prostate cancer in 2010, aged 91. \"I had the unbelievable good fortune to work with Jerry several times when I played guitar with the Mark Joice Showband on the QE2. He used to embark in Ft Lauderdale with his wife who was in a wheelchair, then off to the Caribbean. I'm sure he got bored with me asking him about people like George Gershwin and Richard Rodgers but I was smitten. He was a total gentleman and a fantastic player. We played great music on his shows; West Side Story, Slaughter on 10th Ave, Rhapsody in Blue, etc. What a privilege, he was my conduit to the golden era of music and so kind, I'll never forget him. \" John Hedley "}, {"text": "Pankaj Advani (Hindi: \u092a\u0902\u0915\u091c \u0906\u0921\u0935\u093e\u0923\u0940) (1 August 1965 \u2013 11 November 2010) was an Indian film director, editor, screenwriter, photographer, theatre director, and painter, known for his works in Bollywood, and cross over cinema. Pankaj made his Hindi film screenwriting debut with Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa (1993) which went on to win the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie. In 1994, he scripted, and directed the short film Sunday which won the Children's Film Society of India Award for best writing, and the National Film Award for Best Short Fiction Film. The film was screened at the Indian Panorama Section of the 25th International Film Festival of India, Calcutta; the Asian Panorama section of 8th International Children's Film Festival, Udaipur; and has participated in other festivals including Cairo International Children's Film Festival and 11th Annual Chicago International Children's Film Festival. The same year Pankaj won an award for best writing for Shadow Boxer at NFDC. Pankaj was born in Lucknow and grew up in the small town of Veraval in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat state. As a young boy he was drawn to the magical world of cinema and as a first step wrote, acted, and directed for his school plays. He obtained his Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in painting from the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. At the Faculty of Fine Arts, he specialized in photography and built up a portfolio of photographs. While in Baroda he participated in playwright and film-maker, Habib Tanvir's workshop. He wrote and directed black comedies under his supervision (Andher Nagari and others) that participated in college festivals. He then went on to do his Diploma in Editing at the Film and Television Institute of India-Pune, receiving a merit scholarship for his academic excellence. After graduating from FTII-Pune, Pankaj returned to Baroda and put up a theatrical production of his black comedy Kataria Gul Hui Gawa. Pankaj's next attempt was a short film Highway (19-minute video shot in Baroda about a woman who asks for a lift from a stranger in a car on a deserted highway) which participated in the South Asian Short Film Festival in Colombo and the International Short and Independent Film Festival-Dhaka. Pankaj faced many hurdles in garnering funds for his unconventional films but continued to work even with low budgets. He forayed into TV when Shashanka Ghosh, the then head of Channel [V], who, impressed with his film Sunday and 'quirky' ideas created a tiny space for him in the channel for experimentation, starting off with the promo the dark 'Anarkali Petticoat Show' which got a special mention at the Promax Awards and subsequent shows like Toofan TV and Bheja Fry. His long association with Channel [V] provided him with a platform to showcase his creative ideas albeit on very low budgets. In 2000 Pankaj received a '1. 3 million \u2013 13 days no-holds barred on creative aspect' offer from Digital Talkies which he grabbed and gave birth to the now iconoclastic, underground, cult classic Urf Professor. This black comedy got the Best Film Award at the International Digital Film Festival India and best editing at KaraFilm Fest (Pakistan). It screened at Dahlonega Film Festival; Philippines Digital Film; and participated in Inscreen International Film Festival (July 2006). With support of Shekhar Kapur (guest of honour at International Digital Film Festival of India); Pankaj, Roger Savage (sound engineer, Moulin Rouge), and Jill Billcock (editor, Moulin Rouge) collaborated at 'Sound Firm', Australia, to make a version more suited for an English-speaking audience; the effort came to a naught. It could not get certification from the Censor Board in India for its explicit content. Shripal Morakia of iDream Production gave him a chance to make his stylised, surreal, psychological thriller Cape Karma. Cape Karma, shot in the winter of 2005 in Dundee, Scotland with its non-linear story telling and undercurrents of violence and disconcerting sexual theme proved to be much ahead of its times for an Indian audience and is one of Pankaj's least-seen films. Pankaj's only film to be released commercially in theatres was Sankat City presented by Moser-Baer in July 2009. Bollywood, too, gave its approval and this poorly publicized film got due credit with nominations in half-a-dozen categories coming its way at the Nokia 16th Star Screen Awards 2010, Max Stardust Awards 2010, and 55th Filmfare Awards.

A Collection of Selected Writings of G R Agro A collection of various articles of Ghulam Rabbani Agro written in English is also being planned to be published. Mr. Agro's famous short stories have been acknowledged worldwide. His story \"Bure hin Bhambhore Mae\" was first translated into English as \"The deluge\", by Hashu Kewal Ramani. The story got international recognition and was subsequently translated into many languages such as German, Hindi, Tamil, Chinese, and Polish. Sindhi is one of the oldest languages of subcontinent with five thousands rich history. The first language Muslims (Arabs) came in contact with when they entered India in large numbers was Sindhi. Thus several Arab writers mention that Sindhi was the language of the people in al-Mansura, the capital of Sind. The Rajah of Alra called Mahraj, whose kingdom was situated between Kashmir and Punjab, requested Amir Abdullah bin Umar, the ruler of al-Mansura, to send him someone to translate the Quran into his language around AD 882. The language is called \u2018Hindi\u2019 by Arab historians (in this case the author of Ajaib ul Hind) who often failed to distinguish between the different languages of India and put them all under 22 Rahman the generic name of \u2018Hindi. \u2019 However, Syed Salman Nadwi, who calls this the first translation of the Quran into any Indian language suggests that this language might be Sindhi. Later, between 1020-1030 Al-Beruni visited India and wrote a book on it called \"Kitab Ma-li al Hind \" which was translated by Edward C Sachau as \" Alberuni\u2019s India\" (1888). In this several alphabets of the Hindus are mentioned. In recent history, Britishers provided a very strong footing and base to Sindhi language by declaring Sindhi as court language of Sindh province and played a vital role to develop Sindhi language. Britishers introduced the Sindhi Alphabets, developed the Sindhi medium schools and colleges and introduced Sindhi type writer and printing machines to compete with any other international language. Soon after creation of Pakistan, Bengalis rose up and demanded their fair share in the government. Not only this, they also demanded to declare Bengali as one of the national languages together with Urdu. However, few political groups in West Pakistan wanted to curb these demands of Bengalis and therefore hatched a conspiracy to amalgamate the four provinces Sindh, Balochistan, NWFP and the Punjab as one unit. The conspirators had two-fold objective: To deprive the Bengalis of their right of majority (the Bengalis were 56 percent of the population of Pakistan) and to plunder the lands of Sindh and the mineral resources of Balochistan. The three smaller provinces were therefore totally against one unit. Hence, force was used (as in East Pakistan) to achieve the objective. In Sindh, elected chief Minister and his cabinet was dismissed. In this historical background, during one unit period, Sindhis were suppressed with force. Every step was taken to rob sindhis of their identity. To give the idea of gravity of situation, it is enough to say that word Sindh was intolerable for government to hear. They actually banned to use the word Sindh even in postal addresses. The names of the railway stations, government buildings and roads were written in Urdu script. Records and registers kept in Sindhi began to be reprinted in Urdu. During one unit, every faction of the sindhis played their role and raised their voice against the imposition of one unit. Among them were writers, students, politicians and social workers. Sindhi writers played a pivotal role and demonstrated a leading role during the struggle for the restoration of four provinces of Pakistan and restoration of status of Sindhi as an official language in province of Sindh. Some of prominent names who waged a war against Ayub Khan's Martial Law and against one unit were Muhammad Ibrahim Joyo, Ghulam Rabbani Agro, Shaikh Ayaz, Rasheed Bhatti, Tanveer Abbasi, and Sirajul Haq Memon etc. These writers and poets raised their voice through their writings and pressurized the Ayub government to restore the status of Sindhi language. Finally, Government of Ayub Khan had to succumb to these pressures and one unit was demolished. Ghulam Rabbani Agro received a number of awards, shields and honors in recognition of his services to literature. He was awarded Tamgha-e-Imtiaz by President of Pakistan. He is also recipient of a shield awarded by Farooq Laghari, President of Pakistan. Posthumously, many organizations have paid their tribute to Mr. Agro in many ways. Sindh museum Hyderabad, and Institute of Sindhiology, Jamshoro have established a gallery and a corner respectively. Furthermore, Government of Sindh, has named the Government degree college Kandiaro after Mr. Agro. The college is now known as Ghulam Rabbani Agro Degree College, Kandiaro. https://www. facebook. com/pages/Ghulam-Rabbani-Agro-Govt-Degree-College-Kandiaro/111755995607245?sk=info&tab=page_info Ghulam Rabbani Agro visited many countries representing his country at various occasions. He visited China twice first as a member of the delegation and later as a leader of the delegation of writers. He also visited Iran twice. The first visit was on invitation of Iranian Government together with Nawab Noor Ahmed Khan Leghari. The second visit was as a member of the delegation sent to participate in the Imam Khumaini conference. Mr. Agro also visited India to represent Pakistan in a seminar organized for SAARC countries. He was also sent to Bangladesh along with Syed Zamir Jafferi to participate in the Asian Poetry Festival Dhaka, Bangladesh. Sindhi literature Gul Phul Encyclopedia Sindhiana entry "}, {"text": "Francisco Aguabella (October 10, 1925 \u2013 May 7, 2010) was an Afro-Cuban percussionist whose career spanned folk, jazz, and dance bands. He was a prolific session musician and recorded seven albums as a leader. Aguabella was born in Matanzas, Cuba. He demonstrated a special aptitude for drumming at an early age, and was initiated into several Afro-Cuban drumming traditions, including bat\u00e1, iyes\u00e1, arar\u00e1, olok\u00fan, and abaku\u00e1. Aguabella also grew up with rumba. The first thing you hear when you wake up in the morning is the drums. It\u2019s a national sport, as important as baseball. You see a bunch of guys on the street, and someone will start clapping his hands, or tapping out a rhythm on a Coke bottle with the bottle cap. Then they\u2019ll be pounding on wooden crates, or a wall, or splashing in the puddles of water dripping out of an old air conditioner, or playfully tapping on somebody\u2019s head. You can\u2019t escape the rumba In the 1950s, he left Cuba to perform with Katherine Dunham in the Shelley Winters film Mambo filmed in Italy. He immigrated to the United States in 1953 and performed and toured with Peggy Lee for the next seven years. Francisco Aguabella is one of a handful of Cuban percussionists who came to the United States in the 1940s and 50s. Other notable Cuban percussionists who came to the U. S. during that time include Chano Pozo, Mongo Santamaria, Armando Peraza, Julito Collazo, Carlos Vidal Bolado and Modesto Dur\u00e1n. During his long career Aguabella performed in Europe, Australia, South America, and all over the United States (including the White House). Francisco enjoyed an extensive music performing and recording career and delighted many audiences with his masterful and powerful rhythms. Francisco performed with many great jazz artists such as Dizzy Gillespie, Tito Puente, Mongo Santamaria, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Eddie Palmieri, Cachao, Lalo Schifrin, Cal Tjader, Nancy Wilson, Poncho Sanchez, Bebo Valdes, Carlos Santana, and numerous others. He is featured in the 1995 documentary Sworn to the Drum by filmmaker Les Blank, and is featured in a documentary titled Aguabella currently in production, directed by actor/filmmaker Orestes Matacena (The Mask, Bitter Sugar). He has also appeared with his ensemble on television programs including the Orlando Jones Show on FX. During the 1970s he was a member of the Jorge Santana Latin rock band Malo. Francisco was a widely recognized master conguero and bata artist, a caring and knowledgeable instructor. Aguabella was a faculty member at the annual Explorations in Afro-Cuban Dance and Drum workshop hosted by the Humboldt State University Office of Extended Education in Arcata, California. He lived in Los Angeles, California, where he taught Afro-Cuban drumming to undergraduate and graduate students at the University of California, Los Angeles. Aguabella died in Los Angeles on May 7, 2010 of a cancer-related illness. Aguabella played congas, bata, quinto, coro, shekere, drums, claves, bongos, timbales, cajon and other assorted percussion instruments. Francisco received numerous awards including a 1992 National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Durfee Foundation's Master Musicians' Fellowship, and recognition by the Los Angeles County Arts Commission.

Most notably, Silvino Agudo was the former Governor of Batanes Province (1968\u20131971) in the Philippines. The Agudo last name is traced back to \u201cTuvid du Materam\u201d of Ivana, Batanes in 1751. When the Spanish missionaries observed that people had no formal name upon arrival to Batanes, the missionaries assigned names. Through the help of an interpreter, the Spanish asked, \u201cWho is the leader of this village?\u201d The leader of the Ivana village was \u201cTuvid du Materam. \u201d In Ivatan, \u201cTuvid\u201d means one who knows all things \u2013 like when it is the right time to fish, when to plant camote and other crops, and assist in giving birth. This is why \u201cTuvid\u201d was leader of his village. They called him \u201cdu Materam\u201d because he lived at the foot of the mountain called Mt. Materam. The mountain was called \u201cMateram\u201d because it means sharp in Ivatan and the mountain looks like the sharp edge of a bolo. It was because \u201cTuvid\u201d knew everything and seemed to be sharp and because he lived at the edge of a sharp mountain the Spaniards rightfully gave the family name \u201cAgudo\u201d, which means sharp and bright in Spanish. The Spaniards then told \u201cTuvid\u201d the story of Jesus. \u201cTuvid\u201d was pleased with the story and advised all the villagers to be hear the story as well. The village followed their leader, \u201cTuvid,\u201d and found the Spaniards warm and interesting and agreed to be baptized in 1773. \u201cTuvid\u201d was given the first name Eugenio, so thus his name was Eugenio Agudo. Eugenio had one son. The Spanish chose to give his son the name Jose after St. Joseph, the patron saint of Ivana, because the Spanish were so pleased with Eugenio\u2019s assistance and compliance. This is how the Agudo name was born (the story of Tuvid provided by former Batanes Gov. Silvino B. Agudo). Silvino Barsana Agudo was born on September 12, 1917, in the northern mainland provincial city of Tuguegarao, Cagayan, Philippines. Silvino was the second of six children of Pablo Agudo, a farmer turned tailor, and Consolacion Castillejos Barsana, a pre-school teacher, both natives of Ivana, Batanes. Siblings: 1. VICENTE HOMOBONO AGUDO (born November 14, 1907; married Benjamina Pango of Ivana, they had 1 son, Vicente Jr. ) 2. AURORA ELISA AGUDO (born April 22, 1915; died single and childless in 1949) 3. SILVINO ARTENIO AGUDO (born September 12, 1917; married Honorata P. Arcilla, they had 7 children) 4. ROBUSTIANO FEDERICO AGUDO (born October 12, 1920; married Teodora \"Dory\" Villapando, they had 8 children) 5. RAMON AGUDO (born September 2, 1922; died single and childless in 1954) 6. DAZ AGUDO (born 1923 and died at the age of 5 due to the flu, trancaso) 7. SOCCORRO \"CORRING\" Agudo (born in 1925, married to Atty. and later Judge Deogracias Aggabao; they had three children. She died in 1960) Silvino's parents moved to mainland Luzon because \"farming (in Batanes) could not support the local population. \" Consequently, Silvino's father, Pablo, moved to Cagayan province and established a tailor shop in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, the capital of the province. His father's prospering business provided the opportunity for short vacations back to Ivana, Batanes. Silvino Barsana Agudo's mother, Consolacion Castillejos Barsana, was born December 27, 1882 in Ivana, Batanes. Consolacion was a pre-school teacher by profession and her father, Luciano Barsana, served as Governor of Batanes. Silvino cared for his mother who suffered for tuberculosis. However, Silvino's mother died on May 7, 1930, in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, when Silvino Barsana Agudo was 13. Silvino Barsana Agudo graduated from Cagayan National High School in Tuguegarao, Cagayan in March 1935. Immediately, after high school graduation Silvino's father made arrangements for him to go to Manila to pursue further studies. That was the last time Silvino saw his father; barely six months later, Silvino's father likewise died. Silvino Agudo graduated with a bachelor's degree in Commerce (which is now Business) with a major in Accounting from the University of Santo Tomas School. Silvino passed the Certified Public Accountant Exam (CPA) the following year. Silvino also graduated from University of Santo Tomas University Civil Law in 1941 and passed the Bar of the Philippines in December 2, 1941, at 27 years of age. Early on December 8, 1941, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was in the municipality of Santa Cruz, Laguna for a court hearing regarding a boundary dispute. While waiting for the judge at 8:00 am for trial proceeding, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was informed that the judge was not coming anymore to the proceeding because the Japanese had bombarded Clark Field and Pearl Harbor. After 9:00 am, as Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo left court and was on his way back to Manila, he noticed that every corner of Santa Cruz had posts to recruit for volunteers to join the Philippine Armed Forces to stop the Japanese forces who were coming in from the northern city of Ligayen, Pangasinan and Tayabas, Quezon in the southern Luzon. However, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo did not focus on that and proceeded to Manila, a trip that took one whole day. When Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo arrived at his house in P. Campa Street along Espa\u00f1a Boulevard, he found his house was filled with Ivatans. This was because when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor many dormitories closed in Manila and Ivatan students remembered the Agudo family. Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo generously welcomed the Ivatans and assigned the girls to the upper floor and the boys on the lower floor and the Agudo sister, Aurora, prepared food for everyone. More Ivatans from Batangas and Cavite sought refuge at the Agudo family house. Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo suggested for the new Ivatans who sought refuge to go to the house of Congressman Vicente Agan, Representative of Batanes; however, there was likewise no space. A messenger from Congressman Agan sent a note to the Agudo household regarding a Japanese sponsored boat that would take Ivatans back to Batanes with free passage. During World War II, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was drafted into the 7th Military Police Command. Silvino Barsana Agudo received military police training in Cavite, Rizal, and Nueva Ecija and was told his unit was to do service in Tokyo upon the surrender of the Japanese Imperial Army. However, the trip to was rescheduled by General Douglas McAurthur because of the unconditional surrender of Japan on September 3, 1945. In the Basco Program of the Veterans Federation of the Philippines two veterans received decoration for their service. Atty. Eliseo Reyes, who at the outbreak of the war in the Pacific was a constabulary soldier in Cebu, and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. Commador Geronimo Cabal and Capt. Teofilo Vatoner, the highest officers of the Batanes Veteran's Association pinned the three medals and three ribbons on Atty. Eliseo Reyes and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. Silvino Barsana Agudo married Honorata Arcilla civilly in May 1949 and formally through the Catholic Church on December 10, 1949. Agudo also presided as a defense lawyer in various criminal cases that made appeals in the Supreme Court of the Philippines on behalf of defendants with limited resources prosecuted for murder and rape. Silvino's law office, Agudo, Reyes, Estrella and Associates, was located in rooms 205 - 208 0f the Puzon Building in Quezon City (1974). As the 1967 mid-election approached President Ferdinand Marcos moved to ensure that his Nacionalista Party would be victorius by electing most of the Senators, Governors, and Mayors of the country. President Ferdinand Marcos asked Chairman Manuel \"Maning\" Agudo to choose Silvino Barsana Agudo as candidate for Governor who will most likely win in Batanes. Manuel Agudo's reputation was critically important to Silvino Barsana Agudo's endorsement to run for Governor of Batanes because of his Chairmanship of the Civil Service Board of Appeals, tenure as Congressman of Batanes (1958\u20131961), and service as administrative officer in the Office of the President in Malaca\u00f1ang Palace during the tenure of six Presidents of the Philippines, namely: Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel, Sergio Osme\u00f1a, Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, Ramon Magsaysay, and Carlos P. Garcia. During this time Silvino Barsana Agudo was a successful law practitioner with many clients in the Filipino, American, Spanish, and Chinese communities. Precisely because of his success in law practice Silvino Barasana Agudo was induced to run for Governor of Batanes. Silvino Barsana Agudo agreed to participate in the Provincial Convention in Batanes and then boarded a Philippine Navy boat to Basco in the month of August 1967. Silvino Barsana Agudo's trip was delayed by a typhoon but when he arrived in Basco, the town was as he described it a \"gog. \" Manuel and Renee Agudo rented a house to stay and Silvino Barsana Agudo stayed in the house of his Uncle, Jose Barona, and Auntie Bilay (Severa) Barsana Barona, sister of Silvino's mother. On the night of his arrival the Batanes Veteran Association, a Chapter of the Veterans Association of the Philippines, had a program in the High School auditorium in which Silvino Barsana Agudo was recognized as a Veteran of World War II by the highest-ranking officers of the Batanes Veteran's Association. Two days after Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo arrived in Basco, the Nacionalista Party Convention was held on top Tukon Hill. There was a band to render music while waiting for the delegates from each town: Basco, Itbayat, Mahatao, Uyugan, and Sabtang. When all the delegates arrived, nominations were made and three were nominated for Governor: Jose Aceron of Ivana, Tobias Abad of Basco, and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo of Ivana. After the nominations, Jose Martinez, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo's campaign manager, talked to delegates in each town without consulting Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. After the short campaigning, voting was done by secret ballot. At the end of the day, Mrs. Renee Agudo, Chairwoman of the Batanes Nacionalista Party announced the winning party candidates: Governor: Atty. Silvino B. Agudo; Vice Governor: Tobais Abad; Board Members (2): Emmanuel Aguasha of Mahatao and Francisco Bidayan of Basco After the convention all the official candidates took the same Philippine Navy Boat back to Manila. Mrs. Renee Agudo reported to President Ferdinand Marcos and Senator Gil Puyat the official candidates for the Nacionalista Party in Batanes. Within one month President Ferdinand Marcos invited all the candidates for governor and city mayor to Malaca\u00f1ang Palace for individual conversations with the President. To everyone's surprise, President Marcos knew all candidates' names by heart. All candidates were also brought into a room filled with 6-foot piles of legal-sized brown envelopes. The President's aid gave one envelope to each candidate. However, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was pulled aside and given a second envelope which was to be for the six candidates for mayor in the Province. Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo took a taxi home and examined the contents of the brown envelopes \u2013 each containing US$10,000 in $10 bills or $20,000 in all. In remembrance of President, Atty, Silvino Barsana Agudo bought a new refrigerator to change the old fridge. The rest of the money was distributed and spent for provisions to the Batanes campaign. During his term (1968\u20131971), Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo supported the preservation and promotion of Batanes culture through various initiatives including research of archaic Itbayaten numeral writing systems. Governor Silvino Agudo presided over Batanes during one of the province's most tumultuous times and played an instrumental role in preventing election fraud and protecting Ivatan people from armed thugs. In less than a week after the November 11, 1969 Congressional Elections, Ivatans, the residents of Batanes, were up in arms against the takeover of their islands by gangster-rule during the elections. Reports of the terror that gripped Batanes province have filtered to Manila only several days after the elections, and there was nothing they could do to change the results. All they could do was call attention public attention to the \"rape of the ballot\" in their province. Their grievances were not the sour grapes of defeated politicians. They come from plain citizens talking not as NPs or LPs but, as outraged citizens who were robbed of their right to vote at gunpoint. The takeover of the Batanes group by the thugs is a classic example of a swift coup that isolated the group from the rest of the country. It was cut off from airline flights and from telephone and telegraph communications. There were five candidates for the lone congressional seat of the province. The important candidates were: - Mrs. Renee Agudo (NP) - former Congressmen Jorge Abad (father of Department of Budget and Management Secretary Florencio Abad) - Rufino Antonio Jr. (Independent-NP) Weeks before the November 11, 1969 Elections, about 100 strange faces (non-Ivatans) landed in Basco and scattered in the six towns of the province. Crates also landed in Basco. In late October, Provincial Commander (PC), Captain Fulgencio Albano, collected licensed firearms from the residents \"for verification. \" Provincial Command soldiers met Philippine Airline (PAL) Flights on October 26, 28 and November 2,4,and 6 to Basco to search landing passengers and their luggage for firearms. On November 9, PAL suspended flights to Basco because of man-caused obstructions in the runway. A number of privately owned planes, including light aircraft including a helicopter and Douglas DC-3 blocked Basco's runway. The PAL plane that carried Ivatan voters from Manila had to turn back. On November 10, a day before the elections, telegraph communications from Basco through the Bureau of Telecommunications and Station and Radio Communications of the Philippines Incorporated (RCPI) subsequently went dead. Armed goons had allegedly destroyed all private and government wireless facilities and drove away operators of the telcom and RCPI stations; an operator of the weather bureau was reportedly tear gassed. The equipment was destroyed, however, some operators who fled to the mountains used a transmitter to report \"goon activities\" and request the Provincial Commander Fulgencio Albano and President Ferdinand Marcos for aid. Later during the night of November 10, the Bureau of Public Highways compound was raided and vehicles were destroyed. Even before this, on October 24, Ivatans in Manila held a meeting at D & E Restaurant in Quezon City and decided to ask Provincial Command and Comelec to relieve Captain Fulgencio Albano of Batanes Provincial Command. On November 2, Major Benjamin Amante became the new Batanes PC Commander. On November 7, Major Amante and Representative Roque Ablan (Ilocos Norte) flew to Basco in Ablan's plane. Major Amante stayed only a few days then left Basco before elections. The PC Officer in charge was Captain Velasco. On election day November 11, 1969, the roads leading to the six towns of Batanes were barricaded by checkpoints manned by armed thugs. Governor Agudo and his party making tours of the towns were turned back at one of the checkpoints and warned if they proceeded they might be ambushed. An American Peace Corps Volunteer, Larry Jones, was given six hours to surrender photographs of goons terrorizing voters at precincts. Three days after the elections, Batanes was one of the few provinces from which results of the congressional elections were not heard. In the past elections, which were peaceful, results were known by the next day, there being only less than 5,000 votes to count. In Manila, Governor Silvino Agudo's wife, Honorata Agudo, asked Executive Secretary Ernesto Maceda to assign security men to her house near Quezon City because suspicious looking men were loitering near their home. Gov. Silvino Barsana Agudo remained active in provincial affairs into his retired days as President of the Batanes Bicentennial Commission in 1983. In May 1983, on the initiative of the Dominican Fathers in Santo Domingo Church in Quezon City, a Bicentennial Commission was created to plan the celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the Christianization of Batanes and establishment of a centralized civil government therein. (In 1773, two missionaries from the Dominican Order from Tuguegarao, Cagayan landed in Ivana, Batanes and stayed to put up their church. Ten years later in June 1783, the Civil Government was established in Basco, Batanes) The Bicentennial Commission was composed of Ivatans from Manila environs invited by the Santo Domingo Fathers. The Fathers consulted Engineer Anastacio Agan, former Congressmen from Batanes and at that time incumbent Quezon City Engineer. Congressmen Agan was also the structural engineer who built the Santo Domingo Church on Quezon Avenue in Quezon City. He was assisted in the job of construction of the Santo Domingo Church by Engineer Ruperto Agudo. The assembly of Ivatans who were invited to form the Commission elected the following officers: President, Ex-Governor Silvino B. Agudo; Vice President and Chairman of the Committee on Public Information, Dr. Florentino H. Hornedo; Secretary, Fr. Alfonso Loreto, O. P. ; Treasurer, Rev. Fr. Rey Adadlid, O. P. ; Committee of Ways and Means: Chairman-Dr. Francisco Roman; Co-Chairman Mrs. Josefina Castro-Valera. Members were Mrs. Rucela Barsana Acacio, Mrs. Ana G. Agagan; Atty. Antonio Alcanatara, Sor. Pia Alcazar, O. P. , Captain Pedro Doplito, Atty. Carlos Castano, Bro. N. Comaya, O. P. Captain Pedro Doplito, Atty. Antonio Escalante; Mrs. Agapita Fagar, Fr. Ermito De Sagun, O. P. , and Mrs. Eutropia Hornedo-Silvestre. The Bicentennial Anniversary was celebrated in two places, one in the Aquinas School at Sanctuario de Sto. Cristo at Blumentritt Road, San Juan Del Monte, Metro Manila and the other was held in Basco, Batanes under the joint auspices of the Provincial Government and the Bishop of Batanes Msgr. Mario Baltazar O. P. Silvino Agudo, as President of the Commission lead both occasions. Most recently, Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo's YouTube videos recorded by his grandchildren highlight him singing native Ivatan songs, \"IVASAY KAMOSAWEN\" on YouTube and \"YAHES MO DU VITUGEN\" on YouTube. At the age of 91, Silvino Barsana Agudo's folk renditions has gained the attention from Ivatan diaspora. Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo died on December 17, 2010, in Sacramento, California.

He was an important journalist in the local community and often showed no fear of political flak and was killed. Augustin's death occurred within days of two other murders of Filipinno journalists. Just one day before Augustin, Desidario Camangyan who did political reports for Sunrise FM in Mati, Davao Oriental, was killed. Later that week Nestor Bedolido, of the Kastigador, which was a weekly, was killed. Joselito Agustin was shot four times by two different gunmen on his way home from work on the night of 15 June 2010. The reason why it happened is still somewhat unknown according to local officials. What was known by the public is that Agustin did bash politicians in the area and particularly against mayoral candidates who were campaigning for office positions. Later details revealed that Newly elected Vice Mayor Pacific Velasco, an aide and two others were charged with murder by police. The reasoning behind killing Agustin was because he was broadcasting on-air criticizing Velasco and putting his election efforts in jepoardy. Baccara, is one of many municipalities in the province of Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Journalist Joselito Agustin did speak his political views publicly often, causing a backlash from politicians. Joselito Agustin was a voice in the community of Bacarra. The topics he discussed on air such as local election irregularities were important because he called out politicians that were trying or did corrupt the system. Irina Bokova, the director general of UNESCO, said about his killing: \u201cThis crime must be investigated and its perpetrators brought to justice. This is essential to put an end to the shocking number of attacks on professionals assassinated for exercising the basic human right of free speech and enabling the public to engage in informed debate. \u201d Jesus Versoza, the Philippine chief of police, ordered the creation of a task force to look into the two killings this week, said Leonardo Espina, a police spokesman. He wants these cases prioritized and solved soon. \"Joselito Agustin's death was just one of many in June 2010 in the Philippines as deaths also occurred the previous two days as well.

Ahenakew was born at the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve in Saskatchewan. He and his wife, Grace Ahenakew, had five children. Ahenakew served in the Canadian Forces from 1951 to 1967, during which time he was stationed in Germany, Korea (during the Korean War), and Egypt. An alternate source indicates he served with the Canadian Armed Forces Engineers Corps in Canada, Egypt and Germany from 1962 to 1968 and attained the rank of Sergeant. In 1967, upon leaving the army, Ahenakew accepted a position with the Saskatchewan government, and became active in the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN). He was elected to the position of FSIN president in 1968 (until 1979). He stated that his military experience heavily influenced his choice to pursue politics: \"I could see that what was happening to our people was the same kind of exploitation and degradation I had seen in Korea and Egypt. \" During his time as FSIN president he released a report entitled \"Indian Education in Saskatchewan,\" and played a role in the founding of the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural College and the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College in 1972. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Regina in 1977 and in 1978 he received the John Stratychuk award from the Saskatchewan Human Rights Association. Ahenakew received the Order of Canada in the degree of Member in 1978. His citation read: \"Member of a United Nations committee and of the World Indigenous Peoples Council. His many years of service to Indians and M\u00e9tis in Saskatchewan culminated in his election as Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indians, which has revolutionized Indian education in his province. \" He was stripped of the Order of Canada in 2005 after making controversial remarks about the Holocaust. March 9, 1981 appointed Director of the Saskatchewan Public Service Commission's Special Programs Unit. In 1982, he was elected Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, a national representative body for Canadian aboriginals. On December 13, 2002, Ahenakew gave a speech to an FSIN group, which was attended by James Parker, a reporter from the Saskatoon StarPhoenix. He made references to \"goddamn immigrants\" in Canada during his speech. During a question-and-answer session following his lecture, Ahenakew said that Jews were a disease in Germany and that Hitler was trying to \"clean up Europe\" when he \"fried six million of those guys. \" He also stated that Israel and the United States (specifically mentioning George W. Bush) were going to start the next world war. The Germans used to tell me, and I got to know them well because I played soccer against them and with them and so forth. But they used to tell me that you guys are blessed. What we know about the Indians in Canada. They are blessed. But that blessing is being destroyed by your immigrants that are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well. But there's going to be a war because the Israelis and the \"Bushies\" \u2013 you know, the bully, the bigot in the United States \u2013 tells you that if you're not with me you're against me. After the session concluded, the StarPhoenix reporter asked him to clarify these remarks, and he explained that while serving in the army after the war, Germans had told him the Jews had provoked the war. The StarPhoenix quoted him as further saying: The Jews damn near owned all of Germany prior to the war. That's why Hitler came in. He was going to make damn sure that the Jews didn't take over Germany, or even Europe. That's why he fried six million of those guys, you know. Jews would have owned the goddamned world. And look what they're doing now, they're killing people in Arab countries. The reporter asked how Ahenakew could justify the Holocaust. The StarPhoenix quoted Ahenakew as replying: How else do you get rid of a disease like that, that's going to take over, that's going to dominate? The comments were first circulated in the Canadian national media several days later, and were quickly condemned as antisemitic by Jewish groups, aboriginal leaders and Canadian politicians alike. Both Perry Bellgarde, president of FSIN, and Matthew Coon Come, AFN national chief, were quick to distance themselves from Ahenakew's comments. In June 2003, Ahenakew was formally charged by the Saskatchewan Justice Department with promoting hatred. In an interview in the July/August 2003 edition of This Magazine, Ahenakew expressed to reporter Alex Roslin his dissatisfaction with what he called \"racial control\" of the media, saying that \"when a group of people, a race of people, control the world media, something has to be done about it. \" The article also quotes claims that Ahenakew had long held racist beliefs against Jews, Blacks and other ethnic groups that had been shielded from the public. In connection with the remarks from 2002, which were recorded on tape with his knowledge, Ahenakew was later convicted in July 2005 of willfully promoting hatred against Jews. Ahenakew apologized for the remarks, saying they did not represent his beliefs and that he was \"caught up in the heat of the moment. I was attempting to spark debate on what has been happening to our First Nations people. \" At his trial, he later recanted his apology and blamed his outburst on his diabetes, some wine and a change in medication, a defense that was rejected by the court and he was subsequently fined $1,000. Despite this, he retained his belief that the Jews started the Second World War. Jewish groups, aboriginals and politicians later called for Ahenakew's membership in the Order of Canada to be revoked. The Governor General revoked Ahenakew's membership shortly after his trial. In June 2006, the decision was overturned by the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench on the grounds that the trial judge failed to properly take into account that the remarks were uttered in the midst of an angry confrontation with a reporter, and therefore may not have constituted a \"willful\" promotion of hatred. A new trial was ordered. Ahenakew was retried in Saskatoon in 2008. In February 2009, Saskatchewan Provincial Court Judge Wilfred Tucker acquitted Ahenakew because his statements, while \"revolting, disgusting and untrue\" did not show an intent to incite hatred. Following a long battle with cancer, Ahenakew died on March 12, 2010 at a hospital in Shellbrook, Saskatchewan, aged 76.

Israr Ahmed was born in Hisar, a province of East Punjab of British Indian Empire, on 26 April 1932. His father was a civil servant in the British Government who relocated his family from Hisar to Montgomery, now Sahiwal, Punjab Province of Pakistan. After graduating from a local high school, Ahmed moved to Lahore to attend the King Edward Medical University in 1950. He received his MBBS degree from King Edward Medical University in 1954 and began practising medicine. In addition, he obtained his Masters in Islamic Studies from the University of Karachi in 1965. In 1950, he joined Jamaat-e-Islami led by Abul Ala Maududi, but left the party when the latter opted for participating in electoral politics in 1957. Ahmed resigned from the Jamaat-e-Islami in April 1957 because of its involvement in national politics, which he believed was irreconcilable with the revolutionary methodology adopted by the Jama'at in the pre-1947 period. His interest in Islam and philosophy grew further and he subsequently moved to Karachi, Sindh Province in the 1960s. where he enrolled in Karachi University. He criticised modern democracy and the prevalent electoral system and argued that the head of an Islamic state could reject the majority decisions of an elected assembly. Ahmed was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz in 1981. He has authored over 60 books in Urdu on topics related to Islam and Pakistan, nine of which have been translated into English and other languages. Ahmed relinquished the leadership of Tanzeem-e-Islami in October 2002 because of bad health. Hafiz Akif Saeed is the present Amir of the Tanzeem to whom all rufaqaa of Tanzeem renewed their pledge of Baiyah. Like Wahiduddin Khan, Naeem Siddiqui and Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, Ahmed also worked closely with Syed Abul A'la Maududi (alternative spelling Syed Maudoodi; often referred to as Maulana Maududi) (1903\u20131979) and Amin Ahsan Islahi. Supporters describe his vision of Islam as having been synthesised from the diverse sources. He has also acknowledged the \"deep influence\" of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, the 18th century Indian Islamic leader, anti-colonial activist, jurist, and scholar. \"In the context of Qur'anic exegesis and understanding, Ahmed was a firm traditionalist of the genre of Mehmood Hassan Deobandi and Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani; yet he presented Qur'anic teachings in a scientific and enlightened way\". Ahmed believed in what he called \"Islamic revolutionary thought,\" which consists of the idea that Islam \u2013 the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah \u2013 must be implemented in the social, cultural, juristic, political, and economic spheres of life. In this he is said to follow Mohammad Rafiuddin and Muhammad Iqbal. The first attempt towards the actualisation of this concept was reportedly made by Abul Kalam Azad through his short-lived party, the Hizbullah. Another attempt was made by Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi through his Jamaat-e-Islami party. Although the Jamaat-e-Islami has reached some influence, Ahmed resigned from the party in 1956 when it entered the electoral process and believed that such an involvement led to \"degeneration from a pure Islamic revolutionary party to a mere political one\". Originally a member of Jamaat-e-Islami, Ahmed became disappointed with its electoral activity, \"significant policy matters\", and what he saw as the \"lack of effort to create an Islamic renaissance through the revolutionary process. \" He and some other individuals resigned from JI and in 1956 founded the nucleus of Tanzeem-e-Islami, an attempt to create a \"disciplined organization. \" \"A resolution was passed which subsequently became the Mission Statement of Tanzeem-e-Islami. \"Along with his work to revive \"the Qur'an-centered Islamic perennial philosophy and world-view\" Israr Ahmed aimed with his party to \"reform the society in a practical way with the ultimate objective of establishing a true Islamic State, or the System of Khilafah\". A major Pakistani English-language newspaper commented about his views of modern democracy and the electoral system, \"A critic of modern democracy and the electoral system, Dr Israr believed that the head of an Islamic state can reject majority decisions of an elected assembly. \" According to Tanzeem-e-Islami's FAQ, while both Hizb ut-Tahrir and Tanzeem-e-Islami share belief in reviving the Caliphate as a means of implementing Islam in all spheres of life, Tanzeem-e-Islami does not believe in involvement in electoral politics, armed struggle, coup d'\u00e9tat to establish a caliphate, and has no set plan of detailed workings for the future Caliphate. Tanzeem-e-Islami emphasises that iman (faith) among Muslims must be revived in \"a significant portion of the Muslim society\" before there can be an Islamic revival. While Israr Ahmed \"considers himself a product\" of the teachings of \"comprehensive and holistic concept of the Islamic obligations\" of Abul Ala Maududi, he opposes Jamaat-e-Islami's \"plunge\" into \"the arena of power politics,\" which he considered to have been \"disastrous. \" In response to the state of emergency in 2007, Ahmed called for lifting the emergency, reinstatement of Supreme Court justices, and withdrawal of all actions taken in pursuance of the proclamation of emergency and the PCO law besides resignation of President Pervez Musharraf. In a televised press conference, Israr Ahmed called for resignation of Pervez Musharraf from both president and chief of army staff. Ahmed appealed to President General Musharraf to lift the state emergency and step down for the nation's greater interests. At the television news channels, Ahmed also predicted and warned the nation that, \"If the situation worsens, the NATO forces are waiting on the western front to move into Pakistan and may deprive the country of its nuclear assets while on the eastern front, India is ready to stage an action replay of Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 and has alerted its armed forces to intervene in to check threats to peace in the region. \" In 2006, Canada's National Post newspapers quoted Ahmed as saying that \"Islam's renaissance will begin in Pakistan. . . because the Arab world is living under subjugation. Only the Pakistan region has the potential for standing up against the nefarious designs of the global power-brokers and to resist the rising tides of the Jewish/Zionist hegemony. Asia Times reports that in September 1995 Ahmed told the annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America: \"The process of the revival of Islam in different parts of the world is real. A final showdown between the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world, which has been captured by the Jews, would soon take place. The Gulf War was just a rehearsal for the coming conflict. \" He appealed to the Muslims of the world, including those in the US, to prepare themselves for the coming conflict. Israr Ahmed died of cardiac arrest at his home in Lahore on the morning of 14 April 2010 at age 78. He had given up the leadership of Tanzeem-i-Islami in 2002 due to poor health. According to his son, his health deteriorated at around 1:30 am with pain in the back. He was a long time heart patient. His survivors included a wife, four sons and five daughters. One major Pakistani English-language newspaper commented after his death, \"Founder of several organisations like Anjuman-i-Khuddamul Quran, Tanzeem-i-Islami and Tehrik-i-Khilafat, he had followers in Pakistan, India and Gulf countries, especially in Saudi Arabia. He spent almost four decades in trying to reawaken interest in Quran-based Islamic philosophy. \" Sitara-i-Imtiaz (Star of Excellence) Award by the President of Pakistan in 1981 for his services in the field of religious instruction.

Ahyi is credited with designing of the flag of Togo. Ahyi was known for his massive outdoor artworks, reliefs and sculptures, including his contributions to the Independence Monument in Lom\u00e9, which commemorates the country's independence from France. Other outdoor sculptures and statues by Ahyi can be found on buildings and in parks throughout Togo, as well as the Vatican, Senegal, Benin, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Nigeria and South Korea. He also created his pieces using a wide array of mediums including jewelry, pottery, ceramics and tapestries. He was also an interior designer who created household objects and art pieces. Paul Ahyi was born to Togolese parents on January 15, 1930, in Abomey, French Dahomey. Ahyi attended school in Dakar, Senegal, from 1949 until 1952. He moved to France, where he enrolled in the Fine Art School of Lyon beginning in 1952. He graduated from the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1959 and returned to Togo, which was called French Togoland prior to independence. Ahyi was commissioned to design the flag of the new nation of Togo, which achieved independence from France on April 27, 1960. His finished design, which was unveiled in 1960, is still used by the country. Ayhi used the Pan-African colours of red, yellow and green in his flag, which was modeled from the flag of Liberia using horizontal stripes. The red square symbolized blood shed in the struggle for independence. The flag's yellow represented the soil, while green symbolizes Togo's forests and agriculture. Ahyi added a white star, similar to the Liberian flag, representing light, intelligence and peace. He also contributed to another important Togolese national symbol, the Independence Monument which was constructed in the center of Lom\u00e9. Ahyi's reliefs and sculptures have been installed and displayed at the United Nations in New York City, as well as Canada, South Korea, West Africa, Italy, Japan, and Paris, France.

Ai is known for her mastery of the dramatic monologue as a poetic form, as well as for taking on dark, controversial topics in her work. About writing in the dramatic monologue form, she's said: \"I want to take the narrative 'persona' poem as far as I can, and I've never been one to do things in halves. All the way or nothing. I won't abandon that desire. \" Ai, who described herself as 1/2 Japanese, 1/8 Choctaw-Chickasaw, 1/4 Black, 1/16 Irish and Southern Cheyenne and Comanche, was born in Albany, Texas, in 1947 and she grew up in Tucson, Arizona. She was also raised in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, with her mother and second stepfather, Sutton Haynes. In 1959, a couple of years after her mother's divorce from Hayes, they moved back to Tucson, Arizona where she completed high school and attended college at the University of Arizona, where she majored in English and Oriental Studies with a concentration in Japanese and a minor in Creative Writing, to which she would fully commit toward the end of her degree. Before starting college, one night during dinner with her mother and third stepfather, Ai learned her biological father was Japanese. Known as Florence Hayes throughout her childhood and undergrad years, it was not until graduate school, when Ai was going to switch her last name back to Anthony, that her mother finally told her more details about her past, learning that she had an affair with a Japanese man, Michael Ogawa, after meeting him at a streetcar stop. Learning of the affair had led Ai's first stepfather, whose last name was \"Anthony,\" to beat her mother until family intervened and she was taken to Texas, where her stepfather eventually followed after Ai's birth. Because her mother was still legally married to Anthony at the time, his last name was put on Ai's birth certificate. The poverty Ai experienced during her childhood affected her and her writing. Ai credits her first writing experience to an assignment in her Catholic school English class to write a letter from the perspective of a martyr. Two years after that experience, she began actively writing at the age of 14. History had been one of her many interests since high school. From 1969 to 1971, Ai attended the University of California at Irvine's M. F. A program where she worked under the likes of Charles Wright and Donald Justice. She is the author of No Surrender, (2010), which was published after her death, Dread (W. W. Norton & Co. , 2003); Vice (1999), which won the National Book Award; Greed (1993); Fate (1991); Sin (1986), which won an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation; Killing Floor (1979), which was the 1978 Lamont Poetry Selection of the Academy of American Poets; and Cruelty (1973). She also received awards from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Bunting Fellowship Program at Radcliffe College and from various universities. She was a visiting instructor at Binghamton University, State University of New York for the 1973\u201374 academic year. After winning the National Book Award for Vice she became a tenured professor and the vice president of the Native American Faculty and Staff Association at Oklahoma State University and lived in Stillwater, Oklahoma until her death. Ai Ogawa considered herself as \"simply a writer\" rather than a spokesperson for any particular group. About her own poetry in an interview with Lawrence Kearney and Michael Cuddihy in 1978, she emphasized that there are no \"confessional\" or autobiographical elements in her work. However, in an interview with Okla Elliott in 2003 after the publication of Dread, she stated that some of the poems and characters in that book are \"fictionalized versions\" of her family history and that her multi-racial background and interest in history has had a strong influence on her work in this particular collection. In a 1999 interview, Ai was asked about the topics she uses in her writings, such as child abuse, murder, necrophilia, and murder. When asked by interviewer Elizabeth Farnsworth why she chooses to write on these topics, Ai replied that \u201cit\u2019s really the characters, because [she] write[s] monologues\u201d (Farnsworth). She also spoke about her choice of characters that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more to talk about with the scoundrels\u201d (Farnsworth). In that same interview, Farnsworth commented on the fact that even though Ai\u2019s poetry is written in first person, she is \u201calmost always someone else\u201d (Farnsworth). Ai also told Farnsworth that her \u201cfirst poetry teacher said that when you wrote in the first person, that your work was often stronger\u201d (Farnsworth). Throughout her writing career, Ai eventually realized that her \u201cpoems that were written in the first person were the strongest\u201d (Farnsworth). She also told Farnsworth that she considers herself an \u201cactor\u201d and that is how she is able to successfully write as other characters. Farnsworth asked Ai about her poem about Jimmy Hoffa- \u201cJimmy Hoffa\u2019s Odyssey. \u201d Ai told Farnsworth that she got the idea from watching a The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Carson had told a joke that inspired Ai to write the poem. After she decided to write the poem, she found a biography on Hoffa and studied it before writing the piece. Ai said that she often reads biographies before writing a poem an historical figure. While her work often contains sex, violence, and other controversial subjects, she told Kearney and Cuddihy during that 1978 interview that she did not view her use of them as gratuitous. Concerning the poems in her first collection, Cruelty, she said: \"I wanted people to see how they treated each other and themselves. \" She noted that the difference between the poems in Cruelty and those in Killing Floor is that they deal with her character's whole life rather than a single episode. She described her purpose for writing as \"trying to integrate [her] life emotionally and spiritually. \"When Ai was asked why she thought her work was so \u201cedgy and dark\u201d, Ai stated that \u201cviolence is an integral part of American culture\u201d (Farnsworth). She tries to deal with that in her writing, which is something she said she has been working on her whole life. She said that \u201cwas not able to deal with violence in [her] work\u201d early in her writing career, and that was something she intentionally set out to do. About contemporary American poetry and her own risk-taking in her work she said: \"Perhaps there's a fear of revealing too much emotion in American poetry, despite the go-ahead of a sort from confessional poetry. At any rate, I think that that is my goal\u2014I mean I never want to say 'I have plenty of heart,' but I want to be able to say whatever I feel without fear or embarrassment. \" In 1973, she legally changed her last name to Ogawa and her middle name to \"Ai\" (\u611b), which translates to \"love\" in Japanese, a pen name she had been using since 1969. Ai was checked into the hospital on March 17, 2010, for pneumonia. Three days later, Ai died on March 20, 2010, at age 62, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, from complications of stage 4 breast cancer.

He was a socialist advocating social justice for gays, women and Native Hawaiians throughout his life, and was one of the original founders of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship. Robert Aitken was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1917, then was raised in Hawaii from the age of five. Living in Guam as a civilian working in construction\u2014at the onset of World War II\u2014he was detained by the Japanese and held in internment camps for the duration of the war. In one such internment camp in Kobe, Japan in 1944 he met the scholar Reginald Horace Blyth, with whom he had frequent discussions on Zen Buddhism and anarchism. At the conclusion of the war he returned to Hawaii and obtained a B. A. in English literature and an MA in Japanese from the University of Hawaii. In the late 1940s, while going to classes briefly at the University of California in Berkeley, California, he met Nyogen Senzaki. Originally in California hoping for an encounter with Krishnamurti, he began to study with Senzaki in Los Angeles. It was during this period that his commitment to leftist social issues - such as pacifism and labor rights - became more vocal. As a result of his advocacy, he was investigated during this period by the FBI. In 1950 he went back to Japan, under a grant to study haiku and followed Senzaki's recommendation that he study Zen there. There he took part in his first sesshin at Engaku-ji, a temple in Kamakura, Japan. Soon after, he met Nakagawa Soen, who persuaded him to come for a stay at Ryutakuji for the next seven months. During this period Soen took over for the ailing abbot of the temple, Yamamoto Gempo. Aitken then came down with a case of dysentery, and returned home to Hawaii. He married his second wife Anne Hopkins in 1957 and made occasional trips back to Japan. In 1957 Aitken met Hakuun Yasutani and sat with him for the first time. In 1959 he and Anne began a meditation group in Honolulu at their residence, which became known as the Koko-an zendo. The community that gathered at this zendo were then named the Diamond Sangha by the two. The Diamond Sangha has affiliate zen centers in South America, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Europe and is known for making the rigors of traditional Zen accessible to lay practitioners. In 1960 Soen Nakagawa Roshi asked young monk Eido Tai Shimano to travel to Honolulu to assist at the Diamond Sangha center. In 1961, Aitken made an extended stay in Japan to study under Haku'un Yasutani, eventually ending his studies with Soen. He then worked in various capacities at the East-West Center and the University of Hawaii until 1969, when he and Anne moved to Maui, Hawaii to found the Maui Zendo in Haiku-Pauwela. Koun Yamada R\u014dshi was invited to lead the Diamond Sangha and he moved to Hawaii in 1971. In 1974 Aitken was given permission to teach by Koun Yamada, receiving full Dharma transmission from him in 1985. Robert Aitken was a social activist through much of his adult life, beginning with protesting against nuclear testing during the 1940s. He was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War, and became a strong opponent of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. He was among the earlier proponents of deep ecology in religious America, and was outspoken in his beliefs on the equality of men and women. In 1978 Aitken helped found the Buddhist Peace Fellowship, an organization that advocates conflict resolution globally. Aitken Roshi died after a brief bout with pneumonia on August 5, 2010 in Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii.

Akbar led the villainous stable Devastation, Inc. in Bill Watts's Universal Wrestling Federation during the promotion's heyday in the 1980s, as well as other regional territories, including World Class Championship Wrestling and the Global Wrestling Federation. Akbar started out as a professional wrestler in 1963 as Jimmy Wehba. He changed his name to Skandor Akbar at the suggestion of Fritz Von Erich in 1966 in order to sound more Arabic. Akbar teamed with Danny Hodge and eventually turned on him, starting a feud. Akbar joined the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) for a brief run in the late 1970s and was managed by Freddie Blassie. Akbar also worked as a face in the Australian World Championship Wrestling territory for a season in the mid 1970s feuding mainly with The Great Mephisto. Akbar retired from active wrestling in 1977 and became a villainous manager in with the Texas area territory. He called his stables \"Akbars Army\" in Mid-South Wrestling for Bill Watts before it became UWF and \"Devastation, Inc. \" in World Class Championship Wrestling for Fritz Von Erich and in 1991 appeared in the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico. Akbar smoked cigars at ringside, harassed the fans during his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' matches, and occasionally threw fireballs at unsuspecting opponents. In 1994, Akbar briefly managed Kevin Von Erich as a fan favorite in the Global Wrestling Federation. Eventually, though, he turned on Von Erich only weeks before Von Erich decided to retire for good. Akbar also managed Toni Adams for a short time in the GWF. After his semi-retirement, Akbar still made frequent appearances on the independent circuit, while also training wrestlers. He appeared on both the Heroes of World Class and Triumph and Tragedies of World Class retrospective documentaries, released in 2005 and 2007, respectively. From 2008 to 2010, he appeared as a manager in the Dallas-based Wrecking Ball Wrestling promotion. Often billed from Lebanon, Syria or Saudi Arabia, his father actually was from Lebanon, and his mother, Mary, had Arab roots as well, though she too was born in Texas. With two older sisters, he was the youngest of the family. On August 19, 2010 it was reported that Wehba had died from prostate cancer. Wehba was Catholic.

She was part of the Russian New Wave literary movement. She was cited by Joseph Brodsky as the best living poet in the Russian language. She is known in Russia as \"the voice of the epoch\". Despite the aforementioned apolitical stance of her writing, Akhmadulina was often critical of authorities in the Soviet Union, and spoke out in favour of others, including Nobel laureates Boris Pasternak, Andrei Sakharov, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. She was known to international audiences via her travels abroad during the Khrushchev Thaw, during which she made appearances in sold-out stadiums. Upon her death in 2010 at the age of 73, President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev hailed her poetry as a \"classic of Russian literature. \"The New York Times said Akhmadulina was \"always recognized as one of the Soviet Union's literary treasures and a classic poet in the long line extending from Lermontov and Pushkin. \" Sonia I. Ketchian, writing in The Poetic Craft of Bella Akhmadulina, called her \"one of the great poets of the 20th century. There's Akhmatova, Tsvetaeva, Mandelstam, and Pasternak \u2013 and she's the fifth\". Bella Akhmadulina was born in Moscow on 10 April 1937, the only child of a Tatar father and a Russian-Italian mother. They underwent evacuation to Kazan when World War II broke out. Akhmadulina's literary career began when she was a school-girl working as a journalist at the Moscow newspaper, Metrostroevets, and improving her poetic skills at a circle organized by the poet Yevgeny Vinokurov. Her first poems appeared in the magazine October after being approved by established Soviet poets. These first poems were published in 1955. \u00c9migr\u00e9 critic Marc Slonim described her prospects as follows in 1964 (Soviet Russian Literature): \"Her voice has such a purity of tone, such richness of timbre, such individuality of diction, that if her growth continues she will be able some day to succeed Akhmatova\" as \"the greatest living woman poet in Russia\". After finishing school, Akhmadulina entered the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute from which she graduated in 1960. While studying at the institute, she published her poems and articles in different newspapers, both official and handwritten. She was the subject of criticism in Komsomolskaya Pravda in 1957. She was expelled in 1959 (but allowed re-entry as time progressed) as a result of her opposition to the persecution of Boris Pasternak. In 1962 the first collection of her poems, titled Struna (The String), was published and was a resounding success. In spite of being expunged, many of her collections of verses were published later: Music lessons (1970), Poems (1975), Candle (1977), Dreams of Georgia (1977), The Mystery (1983), Coastline (1991), and others. A collection called Sad (Garden) led to Akhmadulina receiving the USSR State Prize in 1989. \"Many dogs and one dog\", a short story written in a surreal style, was published in 1979 in Samizdat's Metropol Almanac. She assisted in the creation of Metropol. She wrote essays about Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov. She appeared in sold-out stadiums in the 1960s, as did the poets Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Andrei Voznesensky and Robert Rozhdestvensky. Her open letter was published supporting the exiled Andrei Sakharov. In October 1993, she signed the Letter of Forty-Two. She was a journalist in a 1964 film. Bella participated in many international poetry events including Kuala Lumpur International Poetry Reading (1988). After the Soviet Union she published Casket and Key (1994), A Guiding Sound (1995) and One Day in December (1996). The main themes of Akhmadulina's works are friendship, love, and relations between people. She wrote numerous essays about Russian poets and translators, some devoted to her close friend, Bulat Okudzhava. Akhmadulina avoided writing overtly political poems, but took part in political events in her youth, supporting the so-called \"dissident movement\". She translated into Russian poetry from France, Italy, Chechnya, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, and many others. Akhmadulina wrote in a \"resolutely apolitical\" style. She made use of imagery and humour in her work. She used rhymed quatrains in her early works, which discussed ordinary, yet imaginative occurrences from daily life in language that was full of both archaisms and neologisms. Religion and philosophy became her themes as she aged and she wrote in longer forms. Bella's first marriage in 1954 was to Yevgeny Yevtushenko, another famous poet of the era; her second husband, whom she married in 1960, was Yuri Nagibin, a major novelist and screenwriter. Her third marriage in 1971 to film director Eldar Kuliev produced a daughter, Elizaveta Kulieva, who is also a poet. In 1974, she married her last husband, the famous artist and stage designer Boris Messerer. They had homes in Peredelkino and Moscow. Akhmadulina died at her home in Peredelkino near Moscow on 29 November 2010 at the age of 73. Akhmadulina's husband said her death was from a heart condition, describing it as a \"cardiovascular crisis\".

S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia from September, 1973 to February, 1976, just in time to serve during the 1973 Oil Crisis of October, 1973 to March, 1974. Akins was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and on the advisory council of the Iran Policy Committee (IPC). Akins has been involved with the pro-Palestine organization If Americans Knew. Born in Akron, Ohio. He attended the University of Akron, leaving to serve in the Navy for two years in World War II, and graduated in 1947. He joined the Foreign Service in 1954 and worked in Italy, France, Syria, Lebanon, Kuwait and Baghdad before being appointed to the State Department's top energy post in 1968. In 1971 after Libya demanded an increase of 40 cents a barrel, and the oil companies offered only a nickel, Akins took Libya's side. After the 40-cent price rise went through, it was later seen as an important step in the development of OPEC. After attending a meeting of Arab OPEC oil producers in May 1972 in Algiers, where he confirmed that they were eager to take advantage of the increasing dependence on the crude they pumped of the U. S. and other Western countries, Akins correctly predicted a coming oil embargo, saying that OPEC countries could not spend as much money as they were getting for their oil, and had realized that \"oil in the ground is as good as oil in the bank. \" In an influential article in the journal Foreign Affairs in April 1973, Akins correctly predicted that world oil consumption for the next 12 years would exceed that of all previous human history, and warned that the loss of production from any two Middle Eastern countries would push prices from $3 a barrel to more than $5. In fact, they reached $39. 50. Akins was promoted from director of fuels and energy at the U. S. State Department to U. S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia in September, 1973, one month before the 1973 Oil Crisis began. One of his first acts as ambassador was to send a confidential message to oil executives who were forming the Aramco consortium in Saudi Arabia \"to use their contacts at the highest levels\" of the U. S. government to \"hammer home the point that oil restrictions are not going to be lifted unless political struggle is settled in a manner satisfactory to Arabs\", advocating at least some measure of support for Arab claims against Israel, something he would often do later in life as an industry consultant, and was often criticized for. \"Here he was, the American ambassador to Saudi Arabia, attempting to reinforce the Arabs' blackmail of the United States\", wrote Steven Emerson in his book The American House of Saud (1985). Akins' reply was that he was just doing his job of promoting U. S. interests, which may or may not coincide with those of Israel because of growing U. S. dependence on Arab oil. Akins was dismissed as ambassador in August 1975 after a series of clashes on policy matters with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, one involving Akins' assertion (dismissed as \"absurd\" by Mr. Kissinger) that Kissinger had approved of Iran's raising oil prices to buy American arms, another involving Akins's assertion that a top foreign policy maker (Kissinger?) was pondering a United States takeover of Middle East oil fields. Akins also infuriated the Secretary of State when he protested Kissinger's successful request for Saudi officials to grant entry to New York Times columnist C. L. Sulzberger, who the Saudis had initially refused a visa to because they didn't allow Jews to enter the country. Akins claimed to first find out about his firing from a friend who called to read him a newspaper article reporting it, saying \"I presume that I have stepped on a few toes\" in an interview with The New York Times. Akins claimed that during his tenure as ambassador he built trust and understanding between Saudi Arabia and Israel, turning King Faisal of Saudi Arabia from rejecting the idea of a Jewish state to accepting the legitimacy of Israel within its pre-1967 borders. In a 1979 interview in Time, Akins warned of a \"growing wave of anti-Americanism\" in Saudi Arabia. In 1989 Akins and others asked the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to force the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) to register as a political action committee and reveal private information about its operations. Akins was then lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the FEC, resulting in the 1998 U. S. Supreme Court decision Federal Election Commission v. Akins. In 1994 Akins made a speech in which he said: \"Our foreign policy was so pro-Israel that we alienated the Arabs, yet our energy policy, such as it was, made us dependent on Arab oil. \" Akins died July 15, 2010, in Mitchellville, Maryland, after a heart attack.

"}, {"text": "Akira Tamura (\u7530\u6751\u660e, 1926\u20132010) was a city planner in postwar Japan. He is notable for two phases of his career: one as the chief city planner of the Yokohama city government and the other as an evangelist of machi-zukuri (town-making) among local movements. Under Japan's then-highly centralized government system, Tamura advocated for the importance of local awareness and initiatives; this led to the strengthening of local government as an institution to achieve a quality environment for all residents. Although he stayed in Yokohama for a relatively brief period, from 1968 to 1981, he achieved some of the most innovative results in Japan's postwar town planning history. His influence on Yokohama's city planning, as well as on local residents throughout Japan, remains visible and notable to this day. Tamura initially proposed major projects, called the \"Six Spine Projects\", to transform the structure of Yokohama in 1964, at the request of the newly elected socialist mayor Ichio Asukata. After becoming Yokohama's chief planner at the invitation of Asukata in 1968, Tamura introduced two additional planning measures: building and land control measures and urban design. As a new mechanism to reform the old administrative system, Tamura created the Bureau of Planning and Coordination, which linked the separate bureaus and forged a united entity of city government with a wider mandate. In 2000, the Architectural Institute of Japan (AIJ), the country's supreme academic institution concerned with architecture and town planning, awarded Tamura its Grand Prize for \"the establishment of a theory or technique and its implementation in city planning\" (AIJ, 2000), for his work in Yokohama. Tamura remains the only practical planner in the field of city planning to have won the AIJ's Grand Prize; other recipients have all been academics or architects. Tamura consistently endeavored to educate young planners by assigning them important works. Though he worked in Yokohama for only a short time, those young planners became his followers and passed on his concepts and style of work. This contributed to the success and continuation of projects, land control measures, and urban design. It is said that Tamura was initially not a master planner but gradually learned by listening to the opinions of others. His motto was \"amorphous fluidity\": he never remained in one place long and was always moving, searching for solutions. Akira Tamura was born in 1926 into a Christian middle-class family in Tokyo. As a child, he attended a primary school attached to Aoyama Teachers\u2019 College (now a primary school attached to Tokyo Teachers\u2019 University) and proceeded to the Municipal First Junior High School (now Hibiya High School), both of which remain prestigious schools in Tokyo. Tamura did not advance to Tokyo's First High School (the premier high school in Japan for the elite before the war). Instead, during the Second World War (1941\u20131945) he attended Shizuoka High School in 1944, which was several hours away by train from Tokyo. He later explained that he wanted to live outside Tokyo to \"broaden his horizons. \" Tamura entered Tokyo University in 1945, enrolling in the Department of Architecture in the Faculty of Engineering because he thought that architecture would be a broad field, encompassing both arts and social science. His graduation thesis was titled A Study of the Change of Structure in a Big City. His dissertation adviser, a young associate professor named Kenzo Tange, went on to become a world-famous architect. During his studies, Tamura met Takashi Asada, a senior staff member in Tange's office at that time, who exerted a strong influence on Tamura. Asada was seven years older than Tamura and also intended to become a city planner. After his graduation, Tamura worked for one and a half years as an official in the Ministry of Transportation in charge of inbound travel planning. In addition, he studied in the Faculty of Law at the University of Tokyo and earned a bachelor's degree in law. After he left the Ministry of Transportation, he continued to seek a post in other ministries. After several challenging positions in various ministries, he moved to Osaka. Real estate was regarded as a good investment when the Japanese economy was recovering in the 1950s. Nissay Life Insurance Mutual Company, the country's biggest life insurance firm, needed a specialist in real estate development, and Tamura seemed eminently qualified for this position. Tamura spent nine years in this position. During this time, married Makiko Saito, who was from the same Christian nonchurch movement (initiated by Kanzo Uchimura) as Tamura. However, Tamura was not satisfied with his life as a salaried worker in a big company, and he wondered whether his vocation lay elsewhere. He recognized that his work in estate development only benefited his firm and was not his calling. He visited Tange to discuss his future; at that time, he again met Asada, who was now the facilitator of the \"metabolism\" architecture. Asada subsequently started Japan's first city-planning consulting firm in 1961. Tamura began working as a part-time employee, returning to Tokyo every weekend. In January 1963, he returned to Tokyo to join the Environmental Development Center, Asada's planning firm, as one of only three staff members. Before starting there, Tamura wrote a proposal paper entitled Positioning of Regional Planning Machinery, emphasizing the importance of expert planners and urban designers. In 1964, Tamura proposed the Six Spine Projects. This endeavor reconstructed the basic urban structure of the city on its devastated urban land, just after the land was at last returned by the occupation armies. The mayor, Asukata, thought it necessary to establish a new section of the city government to oversee the Six Spine Projects, which would require a new planning approach and coordination across internal sections and external institutions. Thus, Tamura founded a new bureau, Planning and Coordinating Bureau, a kind of secretariat for the mayor in charge of planning. Tamura became the chief of this section. Tamura's first conflict with the national bureaucracy concerned the motorway, whose structure was originally to be elevated. Thanks to Tamura's efforts, this was successfully changed to a half-underground structure to preserve the landscape. After this success, Tamura consolidated his position in the administration. It has since become common among local government officials to become confident and independent as equal partners with the national ministries. Tamura developed a new planning policy to integrate the Six Spine Projects with building and land control measures and urban design. These measures were combined to form a strategic planning tool for local government. Fumihiko Maki, an architect and urban designer who had just returned from teaching and practicing urban design in the United States, served as an adviser to Tamura. Maki worked on several urban design projects, including the Kanazawa reclamation project and its housing development, assigned by Tamura. It soon became clear that urban design needed an in-house team, since it had to handle cumbersome coordination among the city administration and concerned parties. In 1970, Shunsuke Iwasaki returned from an urban design course at Harvard University and joined Tamura's team. Tamura and his staff worked over these main objectives as follows: Minatomirai 21: Central business and commercial district redevelopment on the site of an old shipyard and freight train yard in the harbor area Kohoku: New town development with landscaped housing and urban agriculture districts through land readjustment as a model housing against urban sprawl Kanazawa seaside reclamation development: New seaside industrial and housing development accommodating the relocation of small factories moved from built-up inland areas with state-of-the-art antipollution provisions Local development exaction system: an innovative development control measure by the local government discretion to require developers to donate land for parks and community facilities Urban motorway network: Landscape-conscious motorway network planned and coordinated by the local initiative with part of its network underground Strategic use of the Town Planning Law of 1968: Widely zoned nonurban areas of Yokohama being used for urban agriculture Urban design: Pedestrian-conscious spaces designed, planned, and coordinated to maximize the natural landscape and historical buildingsHalf a century has now passed since Tamura proposed the Six Spine Projects, and they have mostly been completed. It is noteworthy that the Six Spine Projects survived and were implemented by the four mayors who succeeded Asukata, none of whom were socialists. Asukata was elected to a fourth term as mayor, but his term ended abruptly when he became the new chairman of the Japan Socialist Party in 1978 and left Yokohama. Michikazu Saigo, Asukata's successor, won the mayoral election in 1978 with backing from both conservatives and socialists. He appointed Tamura to a nominal post. Although Saigo recognized the importance of the Six Spine Project, he did not believe that they should not be under the control of a single individual, even Tamura. After completing his doctoral thesis, Local Development Exaction System, After obtaining his PhD from the University of Tokyo, Tamura became a professor of the Faculty of Law of Hosei University, a private university in Tokyo. He then launched a campaign to increase public awareness among people with an interest in local community by writing three books: Town-Making in Concept (1987), Town-Making in Practice (1995), and Town-Making and Townscape (2005). These three books are still widely read. In all, he wrote 11 books during his 15 years at Hosei University. It was during this time that Tamura started using the term machi-zukuri (town-making) instead of \"city planning,\" because the latter sounded to him like a \"top-down\" initiative from the national bureaucracy, whereas the former conveyed the idea of a grassroots activity by residents. Tamura passed away at the age of 84, on January 25, 2010, with his wife, Makiko, at his side in his bedroom in Atagawa, Izu district, Shizuoka prefecture. His life was enriched by the pleasure he derived from town-making, and his wife suggested that his Christian faith had a strong influence on him. Even though Tamura authored over 40 books, empirical research on his works would strengthen his unparalleled achievement and provide younger generations materials to learn. Tamura was not inherently a theorist of city planning, but developed his own town-making theory by addressing the needs and circumstances of Yokohama. Tamura developed his advisory activities for the public by going on a \"pilgrimage\" as an evangelist of town-making all over Japan, persuading citizens and local government workers to become confident in their local quality. Tamura put a higher priority on his relationship with ordinary citizens. Moreover, he was engaged in the foundation of the Japan Association of Local Government Policy Studies. Tamura also helped young people form voluntary study groups on town-making in local areas all over Japan, consisting of residents, scholars, and local government workers. These activities are continuing even today. The non-profit organization \"Akira Tamura Memorial\u2014A Town Planning Research Initiative\" was established in 2015. Although the NPO was not founded by Tamura himself, it retains the same atmosphere of the study groups as he started. To this day there are young people who, after reading Tamura's books, gain the confidence and opportunity to work locally with a wider perspective, and go on to become local government workers or community planners.

Then turning his Heimatt to the West Coast, to assistant professor of organic chemistry at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Bergen (UiB). In 1962 Aksnes defended his Dr. Philos. degree, and was appointed Professor of Organic Chemistry at the UiB in 1966, a position he filled with relish until he resigned in August 1993. Some years after this he was still active at the Department of Chemistrywith holding a senior scholarship from 'Norges Allmennvitenskapelige Forskningsr\u00e5d' (NAVF). His academic interests ranged wide. Through his work on nerve gases at FFI he was attracted to the phosphorus chemistry. This was his major research field in which he published articles through the years, including many important scientific works that made his name well known in the scientific community world wide. In the late 1970s he started to work with chemical problems connected to environmental issues. As one of the first chemists in Norway, he recognized the importance of inter-disciplinary cooperation when scientists work on solving multi-disciplinary problems. He took a strong interest in NAVF major Research program on marine pollution and built up a team of specialists in oil chemistry at the University of Bergen, together with younger employees. Later he focused on pollution of lakes, and here his knowledge of chemistry came to its right, when he extracted new knowledge from the previously published data. Aksnes was a popular lecturer, and all his students at the basic course in organic chemistry remember his loudly, involved explanations about organic molecule that moves and reacts. As a student mentor, he was always interested in the work of the students, and he asked critical questions that helped developing critical thinking and expanded the mind of the student. He also raised critical questions in popular scientific articles in professional magazines, the last concerning the mercury of the German U-boat in the fjord off Fedje. Through articles and interviews in the press, and through several popular books on environmental issues for nonscientists, he showed his engagement throughout his lifetime. He served in several administrative tasks, not only on at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (Dean 1969-72) and head of the Chemical institute (1991\u201393) at UiB, but also as a member of Council of Natural Sciences at NAVF (1970\u201376, as leader 1970-71). Aksnes also wrote poems, and in 2001 he published the book Med penn og pensel i Hardanger (With pen and brush in Hardanger) with the publisher 'Hardangerforlaget' in \u00d8ystese.

Born in Greenwich, London, Alan was educated at Morden Terrace School, Lewisham. Alan was introduced to the world of entertainment at a young age, entering a talent contest at the age of five at his local Gaumont cinema. Aged 13 he became a call-boy at the Lewisham Hippodrome Theatre, where he started to do magic sets on stage between acts. He then started to entertain private functions, introducing ventriloquism into his act, along with playing the ukulele. Alan toured in cabaret all over the world and performed once with Laurel and Hardy in 1954. Laurel had provided inspiration for the look of Alan's most famous creation, Lord Charles, who first appeared at a charity show in Wormwood Scrubs Prison, London. Alan made his television debut with Lord Charles on the BBC programme The Good Old Days in the 1960s and the pair regularly re-appeared on the programme. In the 1960s he also appeared on a children's programme Tich and Quackers with Tich, a small boy, and his pet duck Quackers. He also created the puppet character Ali Cat for the HTV series Magic Circle (1977). He was also the presenter for two years of the BBC show Ice Show. In 1985 he was a special guest for Bob Hope's birthday show at London's Lyric Theatre. In 1986 he presented a show on Channel 4 on ventriloquism, called A Gottle of Geer. He also wrote for Tony Hancock, Dave Allen and for the shows Morecambe and Wise, The Two Ronnies and Bootsie and Snudge, usually under the name Ray Whyberd. Alan continued to perform into his seventies, doing tours and also undertaking conference and corporate events. In 1998/1999 he entertained guests on the QE2. He also wrote for many shows, including a documentary entitled A Gottle of Geer for Channel 4, and the ITV show And There's More in 1985 which starred Jimmy Cricket. Alan wrote four novels: Death and Deception in 2007 and A Game of Murder in 2008 (both published by Robert Hale), A Fear of Vengeance (2010, published by F. A. Thorpe) and Retribution (2011, published posthumously by Robert Hale Ltd). He took a break from stage work due to ill health but he did not rule out a return, if his health had permitted. His last stage appearance was in November 2008 when he performed at a special charity concert in Bridlington organised by his friend Sir Greg Knight who is MP for the town. At the end of his performance he received a standing ovation. Alan died aged 79 on the morning of 24 May 2010. It is thought he stopped breathing overnight after complaining of feeling unwell at his home in Reigate, Surrey. His agent Peter Prichard said: \"He passed away very suddenly. \" David Nixon's Comedy Bandbox (1966) The Tich and Quackers Show (1966) Ice Show (1969) Tell Me Another (1976\u20131978, guest, comedic anecdotal series) Magic Circle (1977) Three Little Words (c. 1980) The Sooty Show \u2013 Soo's Party Problem (1983) Mike Reid's Mates and Music (1984) Bobby Davro's TV Weekly (1987)Alan was also the presenter of the panel game Where in the World and of the children's quiz show It's Your Word.

He was imprisoned, tortured, and survived an attempted execution by agents of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. Father Wilfredo served as a priest of Perquenco, a town and commune in southern Chile's Araucan\u00eda Region. When he was arrested on September 13, 1973, by Carabineros de Chile from the city of Lautaro, he was accused of \"slandering and defacing\" the Armed Forces and illegally taking land and acting as a militant of the MIR. He was detained for one week in the Lautaro prison, where he was subjected to multiple interrogations. On the night of September 17 of the same year, his feet and hands were wrapped with barbed wire. He was transferred by a truck to the air base \"Maquehue\" of Temuco. He was a victim of poisoning and brutal beatings there. Later he was taken to the banks of the Caut\u00edn River where he was tortured and shot. Ferrada was thrown in the river, but survived. He was secularized, had two children and died in July 2010.

"}, {"text": "Andreas \"Andy\" Albeck (September 25, 1921 \u2013 September 29, 2010) was an American movie executive, who was president and chief executive of United Artists, during a time when it released two films by Woody Allen, along with two films in both the James Bond and Rocky film series. He also oversaw production of Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, a movie frequently mentioned as one of the films considered the greatest ever, as well as Heaven's Gate, the box office bomb that led to the studio's demise as an independent studio. Albeck was born on September 25, 1921, in Vladivostok, Russia. His father was a Danish executive with a shipping firm, while his mother was a Russian escaping the Bolshevik Revolution. His family was taken aboard an American naval vessel to Yokohama, Japan, where Albeck was raised and educated at St. Joseph College. His first connection to the film industry was in 1939, when he became a sales representative for Columbia Pictures in what was then the Dutch East Indies, present day Indonesia. He came to United Artists when the company made the 1951 acquisition of Eagle-Lion Films, the British film company he had been working for. His first marriage, to Nelly Stal, produced two children, Johannes and Nina. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1958 Albeck remarried Lotte Jamel, whom he had met in 1952 when she had been brought to the United States by her cousin Mickey Marcus, a colonel in the United States Army and Israel's first general. Albeck later had Marcus' experience during World War II and the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War made into the 1966 United Artists film Cast a Giant Shadow, starring Kirk Douglas. Albeck worked his way up through the sales department at United Artists, earning promotions to become president of its broadcasting division and senior vice president of operations. In 1978, Transamerica Corporation chose him to head the studio after its former chairman Arthur B. Krim left with a group of executives to form Orion Pictures, picking Albeck for his ability to control costs and his positive relationship with wary Transamerica executives. Author Steven Bach, who served as head of production at United Artists under Albeck, wrote, \"Andy Albeck was not show business; that much was clear,\" in his book Final Cut. During his tenure at United Artists, the studio produced The French Lieutenant's Woman starring Meryl Streep, Manhattan and Stardust Memories by director Woody Allen and the James Bond films Moonraker and For Your Eyes Only. Albeck also oversaw two films in the Rocky series, both of which were box office successes. Raging Bull, with Robert De Niro playing the role of Jake LaMotta, was a critical success that went on to be ranked on the American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time. Albeck's undoing was the film Heaven's Gate, which went several times over its original budget and earned little in box office revenue in the wake of overwhelmingly negative reviews, such as by Vincent Canby of The New York Times, who called the film \"an unqualified disaster\" when it was released in November 1980. In the following weeks Albeck was named chairman of United Artists and removed from his post as president, resigning from the firm in February 1981 in the wake of media reports that he had been forced to retire. In the wake of losses amounting to $44 million, making it what was then the biggest money losing film in history, the studio was purchased in May 1981 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from Transamerica to form MGM/UA in a deal valued at $380 million. In his retirement, he operated the award-winning Albeck Family Christmas Tree farm in Lafayette Township, New Jersey, growing blue spruce trees on a 200-acre (81 ha) farm. A resident of Manhattan, Albeck died there at the age of 89 on September 29, 2010, at NYU Langone Medical Center due to heart failure. He was survived by his second wife, Lotte, as well as by his son and daughter from his first marriage, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. "}, {"text": "Kurt Albert (January 28, 1954 \u2013 September 28, 2010) was a climber and photographer. He started climbing at the age of 14. Before he wholly committed his life to climbing in 1986 he was a mathematics and physics teacher. At the age of seventeen he climbed the Walkerpfeiler in the Grandes Jorasses and one year later he climbed the north face of the Eiger. After a visit to the Saxon Switzerland climbing area in Saxony, Germany in 1973 he recognized the potential of free climbing (free climbing was practised in Saxony since the early 19th century). He started to free climb in his home climbing area, the Frankenjura. In the routes he would now try to ascend while free climbing, he would\u2014in between attempts\u2014paint a red 'X' on the rocks near pitons he did not need as holds or steps. Once he could place a red 'X' on all the pitons and hooks in the route, and was thus able to free climb the entire route, he would paint a red dot at the base of the route. From this comes the English term \"redpoint\", which is derived from the German Rotpunkt, meaning \"red dot\" or \"red point\". In many ways this was the origin of the free climbing movement that led to the development of sport climbing some years later. Albert was severely injured in a climbing accident on September 26, 2010. Albert fell 18 metres (59 ft) while taking pictures at via ferrata H\u00f6hengl\u00fccksteig close to Hirschbach, Bavaria.

He was born in Paris. Albert grew up in a working-class family. He became a mechanic, building gearboxes for Renault, and was accepted for pilot training in the French Arm\u00e9e de l'Air in May 1938. After primary and advanced training, he was posted at the fighter training center in Chartres, where he flew Bloch 152, Morane-Saulnier MS. 406 and Hawk 75 fighters. In February 1940 Albert was assigned to Groupe de Chasse I/3, a unit operating France's top fighter, the Dewoitine D. 520. When German troops invaded France in May 1940, his squadron was redeployed to the Reims airfield. On 14 May 1940, Albert shot down a Do 17 bomber and later that day, a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, although this victory was not confirmed. He also earned a probable victory over a Heinkel He 111 bomber before the armistice. Under the Vichy government, his squadron was redeployed to Algeria where Albert flew a few missions against the British forces in Gibraltar. On 14 October he and two other pilots defected and surrendered their airplanes to the British. Having reached England, Albert joined the RAF and flew 47 missions in Spitfires with 340 Squadron. In late 1942, Albert joined the Normandie fighter group, a Free French fighter unit that was being sent to the Soviet Union to help fight the Germans. The Normandie group entered the fight in April 1943, flying Russian-built Yak-1 fighters, and later Yak-9s and Yak-3s. Albert quickly proved to be one of Normandie's best pilots. His first kill was over a Focke-Wulf Fw 189 on 16 June 1943. In July he claimed 3 more, and he was given command of the 1st escadrille on 4 September 1943. During the offensive against Eastern Prussia in October 1944, he scored 7 victories. His score totaled 23 victories (including 15 shared) in 262 combat missions, making him the second highest-scoring French ace of World War II. On 27 November 1944 he was awarded the Soviet Union's highest decoration, the Gold Star and title of \"Hero of the Soviet Union\" \u2014 an award almost never given to foreigners. After the war Albert flew as a test pilot in 1946 and was later sent to Czechoslovakia as air attach\u00e9, where he met his future wife, an employee at the American embassy. In 1948, he left the military and moved to the United States with his wife, and lived in Chipley, Florida, then his last two years in Harlingen, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley.

He was the honorary president of the Asociaci\u00f3n Valenciana de Escritores y Cr\u00edticos Literarios (CLAVE - Critics of Literary Writers Association of Valencia). Albi was the \"last of the post-Spanish Civil War poets\". In 1922, Jos\u00e9 Albi Fita was born in Valencia but grew up in Sueca. He studied law at the Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, where he met Joan Fuster, and the Universidad de Deusto. Albi received a degree in philosophy and letters from the Universidad de Zaragoza and earned a doctorate from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. During his lifetime, Alibi remained in contact with Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, D\u00e1maso Alonso and Gabriel Celaya. In the 1950s, inspired by a reading of Marinero en tierra by Rafael Alberti, Albi began to write poetry for the first time in earnest. He began publishing the Cuadernos literarios journal and his literary critique appeared in Verbo y Cuadernos literarios, a review which he founded in 1954. Albi began writing under the pseudonym, \"Diez Claves\" or \"Ten Keys\" while employing surrealistic introversion terms. He is also noted for his collaboration with Joan Fuster in anthologizing the work of \u00c1ngel Crespo, Paul \u00c9luard, and the Spanish surrealists. As a poet Albi was popular both with critics and the general public, and received a number of awards. In 1957, he received his first significant honor from the Generalitat Valenciana, [there was not Generalitat Valenciana in 1957, this must be an error] the \"premio Valencia de Literatura\" (Valencia Literature Prize), for Vida de un hombre. In 1958, he won the \"premio Gabriel Mir\u00f3\" (Gabriel Mir\u00f3 Award) for El silencio de Dios. In 1977, Albi received a second \"premio Valencia\" for Odisea 77.

He owned and was the CEO of the Aldi Nord discount supermarket chain. In the US he owned the Trader Joe's specialty grocery store chain. His brother Karl Albrecht owned the Aldi S\u00fcd discount supermarket chain. The two chains originally were a single family enterprise until a friendly division of assets in 1960. Aldi S\u00fcd operates the Aldi groceries in the United States. Aldi and Trader Joe's, while owned by the brothers, have separate and distinct ownership and operations. Theo Albrecht and his brother Karl revolutionized the German grocery market with a low-cost business model. They had developed the supermarket as an outgrowth of their mother's small grocery store, which she had opened in 1913, in Essen, after Theo's father had developed emphysema as a miner. Theodor learned the grocery business from his mother, in order to escape the fate of his father in the mines. He and his brother Karl developed Albrecht Diskont, one of Europe's largest chains of supermarkets, with the motto \"The best quality at the lowest price,\" and now known by its acronym, Aldi. Forbes has estimated Theo's fortune from the supermarket chain as approximately \u00a311 billion. Theodor and Karl Albrecht split the Aldi Company they founded in 1960 after a dispute about whether to sell cigarettes. The supermarket divided into two legally separate operating units with two geographical locations. Theodor's Aldi Nord set to operate in the north of Germany and Karl's Aldi S\u00fcd, set to operate in Germany's south. The progression of Aldi under Karl and Theodor Albrecht stands as one of Germany's greatest success stories. Theodor retired from daily operations in 1993 and remained as chairman of the board. In 1971, Albrecht was kidnapped for 17 days. A ransom of seven million German marks (approximately US$2 million at the time) was paid for his release. He was held at gunpoint by Heinz-Joachim Ollenburg, a lawyer, and his accomplice Paul Kron. The ransom sum was delivered by the Bishop of Essen. His kidnappers were eventually caught by authorities, but only half of the money was recovered. Albrecht later successfully claimed the ransom as a tax deductible business expense in court. During World War II, Theodor was conscripted into the Wehrmacht and served with Rommel's Afrika Korps. Theodor was captured by the Americans in Tunisia. In 1946 he returned to Germany. It was said that his humble and harsh childhood formed Theodor's early appreciation for the value of money. Theodor's kidnapping in 1971 partially explains his and the family's hermit-like manner of existence. The kidnapping caused him to drive to work in an armored car, using a different route every day. Little is known about Theodor Albrecht and the Albrecht family's personal lives. The Albrecht family are known to be very reclusive and have been described by Forbes as \u2018more reclusive than the yeti\u2019. Theodor was rarely pictured by photographers and he never made a public statement. It has been claimed that he was a devout Roman Catholic. The last published photo of Theo Albrecht dates from 1971, one day after his kidnapping. Another photo of the two Albrecht brothers together was taken in 1987 by journalist Franz Ruch. Theodor and his brother Karl were once said to own an island located in the North Sea where they indulged their hobbies such as golf and pastimes including the collecting of antique typewriters. Theodor had, as do members of the Albrecht family now, a highly secure estate overlooking the Ruhr valley. Obsessed with frugality, Theodor is said to have collected and used pencil stubs frequently. He was also known to wear cheap, poorly fitting suits and preferred plain meals with many potatoes. When he was asked to approve the plans for a new store in the Netherlands, he stated that the design was good, but the paper it was drawn on was too thick: \"If you use thinner paper we will save money. \" Theodor Albrecht died 24 July 2010, in his home town of Essen, Germany.

He was president of Boca Juniors from 1985 to 1995, and was widely credited with the football club's financial turnaround. Born in Buenos Aires to Lebanese Argentine immigrants, he was affiliated to Boca Juniors since his youth. He worked as a construction laborer, and eventually became a prosperous businessman as the proprietor of the Alegre Pavement Company. Fond of ping pong, his affable manner helped earn him the friendship of numerous important figures in Argentine politics, including UCR leader (and future President) Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn, Peronist lawmaker Antonio Cafiero, and numerous members of the CGT trade union. Appointed director of the Buenos Aires Province bureau of the National Nutrional Plan by the newly elected President Alfons\u00edn, Alegre was encouraged to run for the post of President of Boca Juniors by influential friends, and in 1984 became a candidate to succeed Federico Pollack, whom Alfons\u00edn had appointed federal receiver. Elected, and inaugurated on January 6, 1985, he took office in a moment of crisis. Accompanied by his friend and running mate, Credico-op Bank director Carlos Heller, Alegre inherited a financially insolvent football club and a stadium unable to meet municipal safety requirements. The iconic La Bombonera stadium had been repeatedly closed for structural failures, and lawsuits against Boca Juniors were filed almost weekly. Consequently, Boca, the winners of the Copa Intercontinental and the Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica in 1977-78, had by 1984 been relegated to 16th place over the 19 First Division teams at the time. Alegre settled 153 lawsuits early in his tenure by mortgaging his business assets for US$250,000, and by lending Boca Juniors US$800,000. These and other measures enabled him to recover the club's finances, and to refurbish the dilapidated La Bombonera stadium. He also announced the sale of land acquired earlier by the team in the waterfront Puerto Madero district, a move opposed by Boca's former president, Alberto Armando. The land was promptly sold for US$21 million, however, and Armando's challenge to Alegre for the presidency of the team in 1986 was turned back. The club's improved finances led to its revival, and Boca emerged victorious in a number of coveted tournaments in subsequent years, including the 1989 Supercopa Sudamericana, the 1990 Recopa Sudamericana, the Campeonato de Apertura and Copa Master de Supercopa (1992), and the Copa de Oro Nicol\u00e1s Leoz in 1993. The team invested increasingly large sums to acquire players who could strengthen the team, of whom few would remain, however; among his best investments was that of Carlos Fernando Navarro Montoya, who would play for Boca in 396 games, and was instrumental in number of the team's titles in that era. Alegre also stepped up efforts to acquire players from lower divisions, and among these a number became important contributors. These included Diego Latorre, Walter Pico, and Rodolfo Arruabarrena. Alegre and Heller were defeated by Mauricio Macri on December 3, 1995, and the Alegre-Heller administration stepped down. The treasurer during their last term, Pedro Pompilio, was elected president of the team following Macri's election as Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2007, and both the late Pedro Pompilio and his successor, Jorge Amor Ameal, who was also part of the Alegre's management board, continued Alegre's policy of acquiring players from less prominent teams. "}, {"text": "Harry \"The Hook\" Aleman (January 19, 1939 \u2013 May 15, 2010) was a Chicago mobster who was one of the most feared enforcers for the Chicago Outfit during the 1970s. Aleman got the nickname \"Hook\" from his boxing career in high school. He is also famous for being the only person in the United States ever to be acquitted of murder, then legally tried and convicted for murder when the initial trial was found to be corrupt. This is not considered a case of double jeopardy as the initial trial was found to be corrupt; the Chicago judge was recruited specifically to acquit Aleman during a bench trial. Born in the Taylor Street area of Chicago, Aleman was the first of three sons of Louis Aleman and Mary Virginia Baratta. The legendary Taylor Street was the port-of-call for Chicago's Italian Americans. Aleman was a nephew of future Chicago Outfit acting mob boss Joseph Ferriola and uncle to Joseph Aleman. Aleman's mother was Italian, his father a native of Durango, Durango Mexico who was involved in narcotics trafficking. In a 1997 interview, Aleman said that his father beat him every day. The only relief Aleman got was from ages seven to eleven, when Louis was in prison. In 1956, Aleman graduated from Crane Technical High School and enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts to study commercial art. In 1958, he graduated with a two-year degree in that field. Aleman went to work selling race track program sheets and produce from the South Water Street Market. In 1964, Aleman married Ruth Felper Mustari, a widow with four children, who died in 2000 at age 68. Due to an accident as a teenager, Aleman wasn't able to produce children of his own. However, according to Ruth and his stepchildren, he was a loving and kind husband and father. In 1962, Aleman was charged with assaulting Howard Pierson, the 23-year-old son of a Chicago police commander. The incident started when Aleman, at a bar with his brother and friends, pushed a woman through a large window. Pierson chased Aleman out of the bar, then flagged down a police car. Police soon stopped Aleman and started questioning him. When Pierson arrived at the scene, the enraged Aleman punched Pierson, breaking his jaw. Aleman was convicted, but received only two years' probation. During the 1960s, Aleman was also arrested for malicious mischief, illegal gambling, possession of burglary tools, assault, aggravated assault, grand theft auto, armed robbery, and aggravated kidnapping. In the early 1970s, Aleman decided to force independent bookmakers in Chicago to pay extortion payments, or \"street tax\", to the Outfit. If the bookmakers refused, Aleman was willing to use force on them. According to law enforcement and the Chicago Crime Commission, Aleman committed 13 murders in Chicago between 1971 and 1976. His victims allegedly included Richard Cain, a top aide to boss Sam Giancana, along with counterfeiters, mob informants, a security guard from a Miami museum that failed to pay his gambling debts, a former police officer, and another mob enforcer. Aleman was prosecuted for only one murder: the 1972 Logan killing. FBI agents were reported to have said that Aleman \"oozed menace\" and his mere presence was usually enough to enforce the Outfit's will. On September 27, 1972, Aleman fatally shot Teamsters official William Logan in his Chicago neighborhood. Two witnesses watched Aleman commit the murder and prosecutors thought they had a strong case. According to prosecutors, the reason for Logan's murder was that the union man was obstructing Aleman's crew from hijacking trucks. However, shortly before Aleman's trial started, Chicago attorney Robert Cooley was approached by First Ward political boss Pat Marcy and asked to take over as Aleman's lawyer, although Cooley suggested that he could easily win an acquittal by discrediting the witnesses during cross-examination. Marcy, however, refused to consider this. He insisted that the Chicago Outfit preferred a bench trial with a judge who could be bribed to acquit. Marcy warned Cooley that, if he accepted the job and failed to deliver, the Outfit would murder him. Thinking instantly of a close friend, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Frank J. Wilson, Cooley said he knew a judge whom no one would ever suspect. After taking the case, Cooley \"picked up information that was total dynamite. The hit, I learned, had nothing to do with unions and all the other crap in the indictment. It was strictly personal. Billy Logan, the victim, had been married to Harry's cousin. They had a bitter divorce and argued constantly over custody of their son. Logan used to beat her up big time. The final straw came after one of the fights when she said, 'You better be careful, cause Harry won't be happy about it. ' And Logan replied, 'Fuck that guinea. ' He probably could have beaten her up a few more times and it wouldn't have mattered. But Harry wasn't going to let some Irish goon get away with calling him a guinea. \"Meanwhile, Cooley approached Judge Wilson and offered him $10,000 to take over the case and acquit Harry Aleman. Wilson agreed, but later requested more money to compensate for the risk. As a result, Aleman was acquitted in a bench trial. In 1978, Aleman was convicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of organizing a series of home invasion robberies. Sentenced to thirty years imprisonment, Aleman spent time at federal correctional facilities in Marion, Illinois, Atlanta, Georgia, Oxford, Wisconsin, and Milan, Michigan. During this time in federal prison, Aleman took some college courses and started painting as a hobby. On April 28, 1989, after serving 11 years in prison, Aleman was released on parole. During the late 1980s, investigators started Operation GamBat, an extensive investigation into decades of corruption and mob ties inside the Chicago court system. In February 1990, fearing prosecution for his actions during the 1977 Logan trial, retired judge Frank Wilson shot himself to death at his Arizona retirement home. In 1991, Aleman pleaded guilty to extorting money from bookmakers Anthony Reitinger and Vince Rizza in 1972. Aleman was convicted and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. In 1993, based on Robert Cooley's testimony, Aleman was re-indicted for the 1972 Logan slaying. In 1997, Aleman was convicted of the Logan murder and sentenced to 300 years in state prison. Aleman's re-trial and subsequent conviction are historic as he is the first American to be retried for murder following a fraudulent first trial. This was first profiled in 2002 and verified on the A&E Television Network/Biography Channel program \"American Justice\"/\"Notorious,\" and later on the National Geographic Channel documentary: \"National Geographic: Inside\" \u2013 \"Chicago Mob Takedown\" in 2011. The retrial, however, does not constitute double jeopardy. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that the original trial presided by Judge Frank Wilson was a sham \u2013 because the acquittal was guaranteed by the bribe he had accepted. This Fifth Amendment ruling was named Harry Aleman vs. Judges of the Criminal Division, Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, et al. , 1998. It established that bribery affecting a bench trial does not preclude the possibility of a second trial: if in said bench trial the defendant is found not guilty, but evidence shows that an act of bribery took place between the defendant and the judge, the defendant can be retried again for the same crime, and this second trial cannot be considered double jeopardy, as jeopardy had never attached in the first place. In short, as actual loss of life or limb had never been a possibility (unlike in most trials), the first trial, by being conducted by a venal and bribed judge, must be considered a counterfeit one; and any resulting retrial (before an non-venal jurist) must be considered to have original jeopardy attached (i. e. the possibility of actual loss to life or limb is real and true). Harry Aleman died from complications of lung cancer on May 15, 2010, at Hill Correctional Center in Galesburg, Illinois. He is buried in Waldheim Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois.

He was an influential teacher, a founder member of Rescue (the Trust for British Archaeology), an energetic fieldworker, and particularly active in promoting African archaeology. He served as President of the Rome Forum for African Archaeology and was Vice-President of both the Council for British Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society. John Alexander was born near Brighton,and grew up in Haywards Heath, Sussex. His electrician father, having fought in and survived the First World War, died in a motorbike accident two years after the end of the war, when John and his younger brother were four and two years old. The boys were looked after by female relatives for some years, until their mother Lily was able to qualify as a teacher to support the family. From 1933 to 1941, he was educated at Varndean School (formerly Varndean Boys School) in Brighton. He was keen on drama, and recalled that in a school production he once played Juliet to Paul Scofield's Romeo. In March 1942, John enlisted in the R. E. M. E. , and was discharged to a commission in the Indian Army Ordnance Corps in August 1943, serving in Burma as a Captain until December 1946, when he was discharged with the rank of Major. In 1946, he obtained a place at Cambridge University assisted by a scheme for those whose education had been interrupted by the war. He was admitted to Pembroke College to study Modern History. While leading a walking tour in Austria during the long summer vacation, John met Yvonne Villeneau, daughter of a French family resident in London. They married, and John achieved his BA (Hons), in 1948. John then took up a teaching post at the secondary school at Hantoub, south of Khartoum in what was then Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, working for the Sudan Government Service, moving to Ahlia School, Omdurman in 1950. This was the start of a lifelong warm relationship with the people and culture of the Sudan. He was already following up an interest in archaeology, as related by Peter Shinnie, with whom he worked for the Sudan Antiquities Service during this time. In 1951, John and Yvonne returned to England and John undertook a Postgraduate Academic Diploma in Prehistoric Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology in London (now part of UCL), studying under the visionary Gordon Childe, and specialising in pre-Roman Yugoslavia. Archaeology as a modern academic discipline was then coming into being, and John was inspired by the combination of fieldwork and theory that it offered. After competing the Dip Arch, John undertook a PhD in Archaeology at Cambridge University, focusing on the European Iron Age, which he gained in 1960. From 1956 to 1957, he held a Yugoslav Government Research Fellowship, which later formed the basis of his book 'Yugoslavia before the Roman Conquest' He then became a Lecturer in Archaeology, initially for the University of London, and then from 1970 for the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, becoming a Fellow and Lecturer in Archaeology for St John's College in 1976, when he retired from the Department.

Alexander began his career in non-league football, joining Arnold as a nineteen-year-old. He spent the 1977\u201378 season with Ilkeston Town, debuting in the home game with Louth United on 24 September 1977 and going on to make 17 appearances for the club, scoring a single goal, with his final game being the away fixture with Sutton Town on 5 April 1978. In March 1979, Alexander joined Stamford from Alfreton Town and scored the first goal in the club's 2\u20130 FA Vase final win over Guisborough Town in April 1980 as the side won the unique treble of United Counties League Championship, League Cup and FA Vase during the 1979\u201380 season. Leaving at the end of the season, Alexander enjoyed spells with Boston United and King's Lynn before returning to Stamford for the 1981\u201382 season being part of a side which completed a United Counties League double. In total he made 94 appearances for the Daniels, scoring 24 goals. After a short spell at Corby Town, which witnessed Alexander score one goal in two games, he joined Spalding United where he scored 18 goals in the Northern Counties East Football League during his solitary season at the club in 1982\u201383. He went on to have brief spells at Boston Town, Grantham Town, and King's Lynn in 1983, before joining Kettering Town just before the start of the 1983\u201384 season; where he spent two seasons and played 74 games for the Northamptonshire side, scoring 11 times. During his time at Kettering, Alexander had a brief, but successful, loan spell at Wisbech Town, and was instrumental in the club's FA Vase run that year \u2013 scoring a hat-trick against Harwich & Parkeston in a 5\u20130 win on his debut, followed by a goal in the semi-final against Southall. In the middle of 1986, Barry Fry secured the signing of Alexander at Barnet, who were playing in the Football Conference at the time. He scored 22 goals in 72 games in his two years at the club as the club narrowly missed out on promotion. After many years in non-league, Alexander ended his playing career in league football, most notably for Grimsby Town. He earned his move from non-league to the Football League when then-Grimsby manager Alan Buckley saw Alexander playing for Barnet, and subsequently signed him for \u00a311,500. He made his Grimsby debut against Torquay United in September 1988, and went on to score 14 league goals in 44 games during the club's 1988\u201389 campaign; including a goal against FA Cup holders Wimbledon at Plough Lane. The following season, Alexander scored a further 12 goals in 38 games, including the two goals that ensured Grimsby's promotion in a 2\u20130 win over Southend United. He then joined Stockport County, before linking up with Lincoln City for the 1992\u201393 season. After a short spell as Lincoln City manager, he played a couple more games for Mansfield Town, before joining Northern Ireland outfit Cliftonville on loan. During his brief spell at Cliftonville during the 1994\u201395 season, Alexander scored on his debut in a 4\u20133 victory over Portadown, as well as netting a further goal against Glentoran. He also scored twice for Cliftonville as they eliminated Linfield in the League Cup quarter final at Windsor Park. He returned to his parent club, Mansfield, at the end of the season and made one further appearance the following year; coming on as a substitute in a game against Exeter City in January 1996. It was to signal the end of Alexander's playing days, as he broke his leg in injury-time. He did, however, remain registered as a player in the first season of managing Ilkeston Town, although he did not make any first-team appearances. Alexander won the FA Vase in 1980 with Stamford, scoring one of the goals in a 2\u20130 win at Wembley. While he was playing for Grimsby Town, Alexander played international football for St. Lucia, earning three international caps in 1990. Alexander also became Mansfield Town's oldest ever goal scorer when he came off the bench to score twice against Crewe Alexandra at the age of 37. With his playing career winding down, Alexander was appointed youth team coach for Lincoln City, during which time he developed the likes of Darren Huckerby and Matt Carbon. At the end of the 1992\u201393 season, Lincoln's chairman John Reames announced that Steve Thompson's contract as first team manager would not be renewed and Alexander was placed in caretaker charge, steering the Imps to a 2\u20130 home victory over Darlington in the final game of the season. Officially appointed to the role in the summer of 1993, Alexander became the first permanently appointed black manager in the Football League; Edwin Stein had earlier been in temporary charge at Barnet. He lasted only a season in charge before Sam Ellis succeeded him in the hot seat. For the best part of a decade, Alexander then managed two semi-professional teams, Ilkeston Town during 1996\u20132000 and Northwich Victoria during 2000\u201301. During his time at Ilkeston, Alexander ensured the club's highest ever league placing, as well as two FA Cup runs that witnessed the side beat league opposition in the form of Boston United and Carlisle United. He is believed to be \"the most successful manager in Ilkeston Town's history\". He subsequently took charge of Northwich Victoria during the 2000\u201301 season, with Northwich in the relegation zone five points adrift from safety. Alexander orchestrated a great escape to steer Victoria away from relegation and to keep the club in the top tier of non-league football. The club also had an FA Cup run during the same season, which witnessed them hold Leyton Orient 3\u20133 in the second round. On 11 July 2001, Alexander returned to Sincil Bank as Director of Coaching on a three-year contract. He was tasked with ensuring the continuity of coaching and football from the Centre of Excellence through youth to the first team and acting as Assistant Manager to Alan Buckley, his former Grimsby Town manager. With Lincoln entering administration at the end of the 2001\u201302 season, Buckley was relieved of his duties as manager on financial grounds and Alexander placed in charge of all football matters. On 3 May 2002 Lincoln successfully petitioned to go into administration but the financial crisis would leave the first team squad bereft of players as the day saw five senior players \u2013 Jason Barnett, Grant Brown, David Cameron, Steve Holmes and Justin Walker \u2013 released at the end of their contracts with a sixth, Lee Thorpe, departing for Leyton Orient. A hectic day finished with confirmation of Alexander's official appointment as team manager. Three other senior players, Tony Battersby, Kingsley Black, and Ian Hamilton, would later leave the club by mutual consent as their contracts, including appearance money, had made them too expensive for Alexander's plans. Remaining at the club were former Tottenham Hotspur youngsters Alan Marriott and Peter Gain, Northern Ireland B international centre-back Paul Morgan along with midfielders Adam Buckley, Mark Camm and Ben Sedgemore and wing-backs Mark Bailey and Stuart Bimson and Alexander complemented their talents with a series of signings from outside of the Football League. After just one week in the job, Alexander completed his first two signings bringing Ben Futcher and Dene Cropper to the club on initial one-year contracts. One week later, Alexander made a second double swoop with Simon Weaver and Simon Yeo joining the ranks. Alexander oversaw an upturn in fortunes at the club, who were now owned by their Supporters' Trust. He used direct tactics and, following a good season with an impressive away record, they finished in the play-off places with a chance of promotion to the Second Division. However, Lincoln were defeated by Bournemouth in the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. The 5\u20132 result established a new record for goals scored in a playoff final. Alexander was highly praised for his work at Lincoln during the 2002\u201303 season, taking a club that had finished two places off the bottom of the League and was working its way out of administration, to a play-off position on a shoe-string budget. He subsequently earned the nickname 'Alexander The Great'. The 2003\u201304 season began poorly, and in November 2003 Alexander suffered a cerebral aneurysm. Alexander had been accompanied by his assistant Gary Simpson on a scouting mission that evening but felt ill on returning home and retired to bed. His wife later called an ambulance and Alexander was rushed to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in time for potentially life saving surgery. His condition slowly improved and he returned to work in February 2004, where Simpson had been acting as caretaker manager. Despite their poor start to the season, Lincoln's campaign improved. Veteran Stuart Bimson had moved on, to Cambridge United, and youngster Paul Mayo was sold to Watford for an initial \u00a375,000, but the acquisitions of Jamie McCombe, Marcus Richardson, Gary Taylor-Fletcher, Francis Green and loanee Kevin Ellison meant that they finished in the play-off places. Lincoln were beaten by Huddersfield Town in the semi-finals. In the close season Alexander purchased Gareth McAuley and Ciaran Toner. Toner and Marcus Richardson were later involved in a training ground fracas, and were both allowed to leave on loan with a view to a transfer. Regardless, rumours persisted that the morale of the squad was low both because of this incident, and in relation to the payment of bonuses. Lincoln again finished in the play-off places and played Southend United in the final, again at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Neither side could manage a goal in normal time, and all three strikers had to be replaced in the second half. Derek Asamoah, who was in poor form, was brought on alongside defenders Matt Bloomer and Lee Beevers. However, Southend scored twice in extra time to win. Alexander signed a new three-year contract in May 2005. During the close season Simon Yeo, Richard Butcher and Peter Gain chose to leave the club, whilst Gary Taylor-Fletcher was surprisingly released amid speculation about his conduct. Captain Paul Morgan, however, signed a new three-year deal which reportedly made him the highest paid player at the club. Lincoln lost yet again in the play-offs at the end of the 2005\u201306 season, this time to local rivals Grimsby Town, giving Alexander the unenviable record of being the only manager to lead a team to four consecutive play-off defeats. Shortly after this defeat, Alexander left Lincoln by mutual consent. On 30 May 2006, Alexander was named the new manager of Peterborough United replacing Steve Bleasdale, who had left at the end of April. He cited his reason for joining Peterborough as need for a new challenge. Alexander signed a 4-year contract with the club. Alexander's managerial career at Peterborough got off to a fine start, recording a 4\u20131 win over Bristol Rovers on the first day of the season, as well as knocking out Championship side Ipswich Town in the League Cup two weeks later. Despite still sitting in 8th in the league, his contract was mutually terminated following 6 straight league defeats in January 2007. During his time at Peterborough, Alexander stated that he wanted to \"unearth more non-league gems\", and as a result signed George Boyd, Aaron McLean and Craig Mackail-Smith from non-league \u2013 all of which have been hugely successful and now ply their trade in the Championship. Alexander was appointed as Bury's new director of football on 9 May 2007. He was dismissed on 14 January 2008, accompanying sacked manager Chris Casper. Alexander was appointed manager of Macclesfield Town on 27 February 2008, signing a contract until the end of the season. He replaced Ian Brightwell who had left the club one point away from the League Two relegation zone. His first game in-charge of Macclesfield was a 1\u20131 draw at home to Notts County, and secured his first win as boss shortly after in a 1\u20130 win at Dagenham & Redbridge. A run of four wins and three draws in nine games took the club away from the relegation zone, and in April 2008 Alexander was awarded a new two-year contract. He signed a two-year contract extension on 18 January 2010. Alexander was involved in supporting a number of charities. In Saint Lucia, the country Alexander represented in his playing days, he established the Sacred Sports Foundation to help increase sporting opportunities for St Lucian children. Alexander, who suffered a brain aneurysm in 2003 when manager of Lincoln City, was taken to hospital before a match in March 2009 after complaining of feeling unwell but was later given a clean bill of health. Alexander was reported to be feeling unwell as he returned from a game at Notts County on 2 March 2010. He was taken to Lincoln Hospital after he had collapsed, and died shortly after at the age of 53. It was reported that Alexander had been suffering from a bout of hiccups three weeks before his death. Alexander had been due to take charge of his 100th game for Macclesfield Town the following weekend. Tributes were paid to Alexander from all corners of the country following his death. Macclesfield Town chairman, Mike Rance, paid an emotional tribute to Alexander, stating \"it was perhaps fitting that the last conversation we had was about football\". Lincoln City, the club that Alexander lead to four successive play-off campaigns, opened their stadium to allow fans to pay tribute to Alexander. Grimsby Town also had opened up the gates of their stadium to allow fans to lay flowers and memorabilia for Alexander in front of the Pontoon stand. The club also announced that they are beginning to collect money for some of Alexander's favourite charities. Grimsby also wore black arm bands for Keith during their victory over Shrewsbury Town. Burnley manager Brian Laws said the former Lincoln boss \"broke the mould\" for black managers. A sentiment echoed by Port Vale boss, Micky Adams. Paul Ince, a friend of Alexander, described Alexander as \"a figure that all managers should aspire to\". Northern Ireland football team Cliftonville also paid respect to Alexander, with their chairman, Gerard Lawlor, saying \"I thank Keith Alexander for the great goals, the great nights and for always being a friend to our club\". Macclesfield Town's first game after Alexander's death was away to Hereford United, with Macclesfield players wearing special shirts with a tribute printed on the back reading \"Rest In Peace Gaffer\" \u2013 Macclesfield won the game 2\u20130. In what was an emotionally charged day, after Macclesfield scored both of their goals, all of their players pointed to the sky in remembrance of Alexander. Throughout the game, Macclesfield fans chanted \"Keith Alexander, his spirit lives on\". Players and staff at the club dedicated the win to Alexander. After the game, Richard Butcher, who played under Alexander for Lincoln City, Peterborough United, and Macclesfield Town said \"there are a few tears in that dressing room now. Today was Keith's day and we're proud that we got the win for him\". Macclesfield held a 'Keith Alexander Day' on 13 March, the day of the Silkmen's match against Bury at Moss Rose \u2013 Macclesfield's first home game since his death. Tributes were made before the game by representatives of the six clubs Alexander had managed, and 53 doves were released. The game ended 2\u20130 to Macclesfield. Additionally, the England national team and the England under-21s wore black armbands in their respective matches against Egypt and Greece under-21s on the day of Alexander's death as a tribute. Black armbands were worn by clubs up and down the country the following weekend as a mark of respect. Clubs across the country also held either a minute's applause or a minute's silence in respect to Alexander. On 15 March 2010, the funeral of Keith Alexander took place at Lincoln Cathedral, with thousands of people paying their respects. Friends, family and football fans gave a round of applause as his coffin entered and left the church. It was announced that a benefit match for Keith Alexander would take place on 3 May 2010 at Sincil Bank, as a tribute to the ex-Imps chief. Players such as Paul Merson, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, and Les Ferdinand took part in the match, with over a 1,000 tickets being sold. In October 2010, Alexander was honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the Black List celebratory evening at Wembley, highlighting the influence of African Caribbean figures in British football. Alexander's son, Matt, said \"If he was looking down and saw the reaction that followed his death and how valuable people thought he was, he would be smiling. He would realise that all his hard work had paid off. \" As of 3 March 2010 Keith Alexander at Soccerbase Keith Alexander management career statistics at Soccerbase"}, {"text": "Meryvn Alban Alexander (29 June 1925 \u2013 14 August 2010) was the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton from 1974 to 2001.

He is best remembered for his pioneering studies on the trade union movement in Latin America and dissident communist political parties, including ground-breaking monographs on the International Communist Right Opposition, Maoism, and the international Trotskyist movement. Robert J. Alexander was born in Canton, Ohio on November 26, 1918. His family moved to Leonia, New Jersey in 1922, when his father, Ralph S. Alexander accepted a teaching position at Columbia University. Alexander graduated from the public high school in 1936 and matriculated at Columbia, receiving a B. A. in 1940 and a Master of Arts degree the following year. In 1936 Alexander took a senior trip to Spain, which sparked a lifelong interest in Hispanic cultures. Alexander was drafted in April 1942 into the United States Army Air Corps. He spent 25 months stationed in Great Britain, during which time he spent his off hours speaking to a number of British trade unionists, taking extensive notes of his conversations. These discussions helped Alexander to refine an interview style of research which would later become a hallmark of his academic work. After demobilization he began work for the State Department. While there, he received a grant from the Office of International Exchange of Persons of the State Department to work on his Ph. D. dissertation on labor relations in Chile, where he conducted hundreds of interviews in virtually all the major factories of the country. He received his Ph. D. from Columbia in 1950. Alexander was married to Joan O. Powell in 1949. The couple had two children. Alexander was active in the socialist and trade union movements. In 1934, politicized by the Great Depression, Alexander joined the Young People's Socialist League, the youth section of the Socialist Party of America. He continued organizing activities for YPSL while at Columbia and remained an active member of its parent group, the Socialist Party of America, serving as a member of its executive council 1957 to 1966. When the Socialist Party changed its name in December 1972 to Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA), he maintained his membership until 1980; according to Perrone's biographical sketch, Alexander thought that SDUSA had become \"too conservative\". It was as a leader of the New Jersey YPSLs that he first met Jay Lovestone, then head of the Communist Party, Opposition. Alexander would later go on six missions to Latin America for Lovestone, first under the auspices of the Free Trade Union Committee, then under the direction of the AFL-CIO International Department. Alexander was a member of the Board of Directors of the Rand School of Social Science from 1952 until its closure in 1956. He served on the League for Industrial Democracy's National Council and was an active member of Americans for Democratic Action and a delegate to several of its national conventions. During the 1950s, Alexander served as a consultant for the American Federation of Labor and AFL-CIO on the organized labor movement in Latin American and the Caribbean. In 1961, he was named by president-elect John F. Kennedy to the Task Force on Latin America, which recommended the establishment of the Alliance for Progress. Alexander was also a lifelong member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Alexander became an instructor at Rutgers while still in Chile in the late 1940s. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1950, associate professor in 1956, and full professor in 1961. Although Alexander was a member of the Economics department at Rutgers, he was an interdisciplinary scholar, working extensively in the fields of political science and history. Alexander was regarded as a champion of the principle of academic freedom and was a founder of the faculty union at Rutgers. In 1963 Alexander achieved his \"highest honor\", the Order of the Condor of the Andes from the Bolivian government. Alexander was a founding member of the Middle Atlantic Council of Latin American Studies (MACLAS), and served as the group's president from 1987 to 1988. During his career, Alexander wrote and published extensively on Latin American politics and trade union movements, as well as surveys on dissident radical movements such as the Right Opposition, Trotskyism, and Maoism. Alexander retired from Rutgers in 1989. Robert J. Alexander died April 27, 2010. He was 91 years old at the time of his death. Alexander's voluminous papers are housed by the Special Collections and University Archives section of Rutgers University, located in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The collection includes 215 cubic feet (6,100 L) of material, which is housed off site. Labor Parties of Latin America. New York: League for Industrial Democracy, 1942.

Alf was born in Vila Isabel, Rio de Janeiro, and began playing piano at age 9. His father died when he was 3 and he was raised by his mother who worked as a maid to raise him. He attended Col\u00e9gio Pedro II, receiving support from his mother's employers. He played in nightclubs in the Copacabana neighborhood of Rio, where he was noticed by later bossa nova pioneers. His first single, \"Falseta\" was released in 1952, with a debut album following in 1961. Over his career, he recorded nine albums and appeared on nearly fifty others. He died in 2010, aged 80, from prostate cancer. Johnny Alf (b. Alfredo Jos\u00e9 da Silva) was born on May 19, 1929, in Vila Isabel, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Alf's father, an army corporal, fought in the Brazilian civil war of 1932, the Constitutionalist Revolution, and perished in combat in the valley of Para\u00edba. His mother raised him alone, making a living as a maid. She found emplyment with a family in Tijuca, a quarter close to the centre of Rio. The family of the household, as well as being very welcoming to both Johnny and his mother, had much respect for music and supported Alf as he began to discover the art form. Alfredo's mother was able to enroll him at the IBEU (Instituto Brasil-Estados Unidos or Brazilian-American Institute), and it was there that Alf received his first formal musical training, studying classical piano with instructor Geni B\u00e1lsamo; it was there too that young Alfredo earned the Americanized nickname that would accompany him through the entirety of his musical career. Due to his purported shyness Alf spent much more of his time listening to records (the music of the Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole Trio (Nat King Cole) and of the strongly classically influenced English pianist George Shearing being specific favorites) than practicing his technical skills on the piano. It was Alf's growing desire to enhance his technical abilities on the piano that led him to seek acceptance into the recently founded Sinatra-Farney Fan Club. The Sinatra-Farney Fan Club was a performer's collective of sorts, an appreciation for the crooning vocal jazz epitomized by artists such as Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and Brazilian born Dick Farney (b. Farn\u00e9sio Dutra, a Carioca) being the thread that unified all of its members. Alf's membership in the club finally allowed him regular access to a piano (which he was permitted to use for practice only on weeknights that had no other scheduled club activities), as well as a group of musically sympathetic peers with which to play and experiment. The jam sessions held by the Sinatra-Farney Fan Club provided Alf his first taste of collaborative music-making and public, musical performance, the club's status being respectable enough around Rio for its members to be allowed to play (without pay) venues such as the Tijuca Tennis Club, the Fluminense Club, and the Athletic Association of the Bank of Brazil. In 1950 the death of the mother of two of the founding members stranded the club without a rehearsal headquarters and it was at this point that Alf began to pursue a professional musical career. Alf received his first professional break in 1952 when he was hired (on Dick Farney's recommendation) as the pianist at the newly inaugurated Cantina do C\u00e9sar where his appointed task was, apparently, to \u201caid the digestion of the guests\u201d. The food proving in most a cases a meager incentive for the customers\u2019 return, the cantina's owner, C\u00e9sar de Alencar (a popular radio host in Rio at the time), soon converted the space into a proper club\u2014or inferninho (little hell)\u2014and gave Johnny Alf free musical reign. Alf would receive frequent visits from artists such as pianist Jo\u00e3o Donato, vocalist Dolores Duran, and guitarist/vocalist Jo\u00e3o Gilberto would often accompany his colleagues in a duet or two before they were on their way. The musical fare in the first years of Alf's professional career rarely varied from the usual Samba-can\u00e7\u00e3oes (meaning, simply, samba-songs) and foxtrots, however Alf's familiarity with American Jazz styles imbued his playing, his vocal performances, and his on-stage banter with the mystery and prestige of New York's 52nd Street. As Alf's modest reputation slowly grew he managed to catch the eye of producer Ramalho Neto, who expressed interest in recording Alf. This brief pairing would produce Alf's first two recordings. Alf assembled a trio (in the style of Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole) composed of guitarist Garoto, double-bassist Vidal, and himself on Piano and recorded two tunes: \u201cFalseta\u201d (Deceit) composed by Alf himself, and \u201cDe cigarro em cigarro\u201d (From Cigarette to Cigarette) composed by fellow Brazilian Luiz Bonf\u00e1. The recordings garnered no more than a pittance of recognition for Alf at the time, but would later (in the early 1960s) be hailed as the progenitors of the Bossa Nova style. Various opinions are now held about the validity of such a statement, but it can confidently be said that these two recordings displayed a largely novel sound, one that had not yet been heard by the majority of Brazilians. Following these sessions Alf would continue to find nightly work in the clubs of Rio de Jainero, musical companions such as Jo\u00e3o Gilberto, Jo\u00e3o Donato, and eventually the young pianist Antonio Carlos Jobim, following him from venue to venue provided they could afford the cover fee. For two years Alf contented himself with ephemeral engagements at clubs including the Monte Carlo in G\u00e1vea, the Clube da Chave, the Mandarim, and the Drink before settling at the Hotel Plaza nightclub in 1954. The Hotel Plaza nightclub was known throughout Copacabana as a haunted venue, which conveniently allowed Alf the freedom to experiment musically to a degree that would not have been possible had he been playing for anyone other than his loyal fan-base. He was able to play his own early compositions (\u201cRapaz De Bem\u201d, \u201cC\u00e9u E Mar\u201d, and \u201cO Que \u00c9 Amar\u201d among others) in a professional setting as well as the compositions of his colleagues and fellow innovators. During the early hours of the evening before the club had attracted any audience, Alf would hold impromptu jam sessions with whomever happened to show up and it was by way of these improvisatory collaborations that the harmonic and rhythmic structures that would eventually blossom into the style now known as Bossa Nova, were originally developed. While Alf's tenure at the Plaza Hotel may have been musically and artistically convenient it was far from economically convenient and when, in 1955, Alf was offered a position as the house pianist at a new club, Bai\u00faca, opening in S\u00e3o Paulo, he jumped at the opportunity, even though it meant leaving the tight-knit musical community he had helped to create in Rio. At Bai\u00faca Alf would form a duo with himself on the piano and double-bassist Sab\u00e1. Unfortunately, however, the group had time only to establish a moderate following before the Bai\u00faca was closed down for reasons pertaining to health-code violations. Once again Alf found himself pounding the pavement on a nightly basis in search of steady work and, while he never starved he began (by the estimations of some) to stagnate musically. The musicians Alf had left in Rio had continued to innovate in his absence while he himself had had no time for anything more than the work required to earn his daily wages. By the time Alf recorded his first full-length LP (\u201cRapaz De Bem\u201d) in 1961 his songs had begun to sound stale. That same year Alf, who had never been fond of the term Bossa Nova, and had always tried to distance himself from the connotations the title entailed, declined an invitation to play at Carnegie Hall's historic Bossa Nova Festival. Alf's decision not to attend the aforementioned festival marks a decisive point in his professional history. After 1961, very little was heard from Alf, although he continued to produce albums infrequently throughout the 60s and early 70s, many of which display a sound very similar to that which was displayed on \u201cRapaz De Bem. \u201d The rest of Alf's career would be spent in S\u00e3o Paulo, collaborating with other artists from time to time, occasionally embarking on solo recording projects, and earning most of his living from his performances in the clubs of S\u00e3o Paulo. Alf would eventually gain employment at a local conservatory of music. Johnny Alf died on March 4, 2010, in Santo Andre, Brazil (just outside S\u00e3o Paulo, his home of the past fifty years) of complications caused by prostate cancer. He left no immediate survivors. Alf's first recordings (\u201cFalseta\u201d and \u201cDe cigarro em cigarro\u201d) were similar rhythmically and structurally to the well-known samba-can\u00e7\u00e3os of the day, they differed only in their harmonic richness and their melodies, both of which aspects were heavily influenced by American jazz styles and improvisations of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Alf's live playing at the Plaza Hotel was heavily influenced by jazz and \u201cstamped with the imprimatur of George Shearing [and] Lennie Tristano\u201d. New York Times columnist Larry Rohter relates, on behalf of Alf's music, that it possessed \u201ca light and airy feeling that expressed the optimism and joie de vivre that Brazilians think of as among their defining national traits\u201d. Alf has said of his own music: \u201cI always played in my own style [\u2026] I had the idea of joining Brazilian music with jazz. I try to bring everything together to achieve an agreeable result\u201d. Much conjecture surrounds the significance of Alf's role in the development of the Bossa Nova style. Many believe the title \u2018Father of Bossa Nova\u2019 to be hyperbolic while others believe firmly that Alf's earliest recordings (\u201cFalceta\u201d, \u201cRapaz de Bem\u201d, etc. ) paved the way for the entire stylistic shift that became Bossa Nova. While we cannot lay to rest these disagreements we can say confidently that Johnny Alf was, in his endeavor to mix traditional Brazilian music with American jazz, a sound innovator, and a great influence and inspiration to his peers, some of whom would go on to acquire fame under the heading Bossa Nova. \u201cFrom him I learned all of the modern harmonies that Brazilian music began to use in the bossa nova, samba-jazz and instrumental songs\u201d said pianist and arranger Jo\u00e3o Donato, \u201cHe opened the doors for us with his way of playing piano, with its jazz influence. When my generation arrived, he had already planted the seeds\u201d added guitarist and composer Carlos Lyra.

It is thought that, before becoming an accomplice in bombing various American embassies, Ali worked in the field of agriculture, with formal training in the industry. American Homeland Security officials considered Ali an operative of al-Qaeda. Ali had been part of an al Qaeda cell operating in Somalia in the early 1990s that provided training to Somali tribesmen who attacked U. S. forces in that country, according to his indictment. Ali lived in Kenya until fleeing the country on August 2, 1998. He located himself in Karachi, Pakistan until the bombings on August 7, 1998. Ali was indicted for his suspected role in the 1998 United States embassy bombings by a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The United States Government's Rewards for Justice program had offered a 5 million US dollar reward for information directly leading to the capture of Hamed Ali. On October 10, 2001, he was placed on the initial list of the FBI's top 22 Most Wanted Terrorists. He served as al-Qaeda's chief of paramilitary operations for Afghanistan. The National Counterterrorism Center reported on February 21, 2011 that Ali was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan in 2010. By May 2012, Ali was no longer listed as a wanted terrorist by either Rewards for Justice or the FBI.

He was born in Aswan in Upper Egypt and studied at Al-Azhar University. He published his first story in 1969, and eventually wrote six novels and three short story collections. Among his best-known works are Dongola and Poor, both of which have been published in English by the AUC Press, in translations by Peter Theroux and Elliot Colla respectively. Theroux\u2019s translation of Dongola received the Arkansas Arabic Translation Award in 1997. Idris Ali's work dealt largely with life in his native Nubia. He was a strong voice against the poverty and deprivation suffered by the Nubian people, and he protested against the loss of native land caused by the building of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s and 70s. He lived in Libya between 1976 and 1980, and his last book The Leader Having a Haircut (2010) caused considerable controversy when it was banned at the 2010 Cairo International Book Fair due to its critical depiction of the Gaddafi regime. Also notable is his novel The Explosion of the Skull which won the Best Egyptian Novel award in 1999 and led to his meeting President Hosni Mubarak. This also improved his financial circumstances somewhat. Ali spent large parts of his life in poverty, as recounted in his autobiography Below the Poverty Line. He worked for a construction company for low wages when the income from his writings proved to be insufficient. He also suffered the loss of his son which led to multiple suicide attempts in his later years. "}, {"text": "M Innas Ali (September 1, 1916 \u2013 May 3, 2010) was a Bangladeshi physicist.

He was assassinated on the morning of 12 January 2010 (some minutes before 8 o'clock, local time) in front of his home in Tehran, while leaving for university. Majid Jamali Fashi was convicted of his killing and executed on 15 May 2012. According to Time magazine, Western intelligence confirmed that the confession of Majid Jamali Fashi was genuine. Alimohammadi was the first PhD graduate student in physics of the Sharif University of Technology. He published some 53 articles and letters in peer-reviewed academic journals and wrote and translated several physics textbooks, including Modern Quantum Mechanics, revised edition, by J. J. Sakurai, which he translated from English into Persian in collaboration with Hamidreza Moshfegh. He entered Shiraz University in 1978 where he obtained his BSc in 1985. He subsequently moved to the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, to study for his MSc in Physics. In 1988 he began with his PhD studies at this University as one of its first PhD students in physics. He obtained his PhD there in 1992. He was a quantum field theorist with interests in such diverse fields as Condensed matter physics (Quantum Hall effect in curved geometries), cosmology (modified gravity, dark energy, etc. ) and string theory. Quantum field theory is a subject matter quite distinct from nuclear physics, nuclear engineering in general, and nuclear weapons and nuclear power. Iran's Atomic Energy Agency has in an official statement rejected media reports that Alimohammadi was associated with Iran's nuclear program. However, in an interview published in the Christian Science Monitor in July 2014, his widow Mansoureh Karami spoke of his \"top secret nuclear work\". Alimohammadi was a Council Member of International Centre for Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science Applications in the Middle East. He was a professor at Tehran University's Physics faculty. Some sites claimed he was a professor at Imam Hossein University. but Iranian analyst Muhammad Sahimi writes \"He was not affiliated with the IRGC-controlled universities, namely Malek-e Ashtar and Emam Hossein universities. \" Ali Moghari, the director of the science department of Tehran University, described Mr. Ali Mohammadi as an \"apolitical professor\". \"He was a well-known professor but was not politically active. \" Ahmad Shirzad (reformist member of the 6th Iranian Parliament, professor of physics in Isfahan and Masoud Alimohammadi's close friend) writes \"In general his beliefs and actions were close to that of moderate Muslims. . . . During the past couple of years he had ideologically become very close to the reformist movement. In the past few elections before the recent presidency election, he had voted for the reformist candidates and had been campaigning for them too. \" Shirzad adds that Alimohammadi told him how he and his students took part in 2009 Iranian election protests, 16 June. The governmental media portrayed him as a \"revolutionary and staunch supporter of Islamic Revolution\". It was claimed by Tehran University's Basij, or voluntary Islamist student militia, that his name was on a list of sanctioned individuals connected with Iranian nuclear program. but, he was not on a compiled list. Mohammadi was among 240 university professors who signed a letter before the 2009 Presidential Election expressing support for the main opposition candidate, Mir Hossein Moussavi. On reporting his burial, Al Jazeera reported on his lack of political involvement deepening the confusion over what motivation could have been behind the murder. They reported, \"one of Ali Mohammadi's close friends (was quoted) as saying that the professor was never a political activist,\" and that, \". . . Mohammadi had very deep reformist tendencies but never mixed it up with his professional character. \" Ali Moghara, who heads the physics faculty at Tehran University, said Ali Mohammadi was just a \"world famous\" physicist who engaged in \"no political activity\". He was married to Mansoureh Karami (Persian: \u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631\u0647 \u0643\u0631\u0645\u06cc) before his assassination. At 07:58 am, a booby-trapped motorbike parked near his car exploded while he was leaving home in Gheytariyeh neighbourhood of northern Tehran, for university. The windows of residences around the scientist's home were shattered by the force of remote controlled explosion, and it was reported that two other people were also injured in the blast. Iranian state media accused Israel, and the US of responsibility, while the US State Department called the allegation \"absurd\". Ynetnews stated that \"there is no known connection between his participation\" in the SESAME, an international synchrotron-radiation facility located in Jordan, and the assassination. According to US intelligence sources, Israel is running a secret war against Iran, among techniques used are the killing of important persons in the Iranian atomic energy program. Another source found the assassination of \"a 50-year-old researcher with no prominent political voice, no published work with military relevance and no declared links to Iran's nuclear program\", as puzzling, although there were comparisons with the disappearance of Shahram Amiri in 2009 and the death of Ardeshir Hosseinpour in 2007. On 25 January 2010, Iran summoned the Swiss ambassador to Iran, who is representing the interests of United States in Iran, demanding the extradition of individuals associated with U. S. based Tondar group, whom Iran believes are behind the bombing. On 14 January, Alimohammadi was buried. His burial was arranged at Emamz\u0101deh Ali-Akbar Chizar in Tehran on Thursday 14 January 2010. Timesonline described it as \"Supporters of Iran\u2019s regime hijacked the funeral. \" As his body was carried from his home in northern Tehran hundreds of government loyalists surrounded it and were shown on Iranian state television waving Iranian flags and chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans. The Iranian government has initiated an investigation and termed the blast a \"terror attack with the aim of stalling Iranian scientific progress\". Iran's Press TV quoted the ministry spokesman Ramin Mehman-Parast, \"Primary investigations into the assassination revealed signs of the involvement of the Zionist regime of Israel, the US and their allies in Iran. \" In the same article a professor at Tehran University is quoted as having said, \"It is widely believed among colleagues that he was assassinated by terrorist organizations probably supported by the United States and with connections with the Americans and the Israelis under different names. \" On 13 January 2010, Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said, \"We had received information a few days before the incident that intelligence services of the Zionist regime of Israel intend to carry out terrorist acts in Tehran in cooperation with the CIA of the US. \"Twenty-four-year-old Majid Jamali Fashi was arrested days after the killing, and in January 2011, Iranian state television aired a confession by Fashi to having killed Alimohammadi on behalf of Mossad. Fashi's arrest may have come as a result of a September 2009 WikiLeaks diplomatic cable from the US Embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan. The cable quoted an Iranian source who was a licensed martial arts coach who was in contact with the Americans. Fashi was reportedly in Baku to participate in an international martial arts competition days before the cable was written. On 28 August 2011, Fashi was convicted and sentenced to death by the Islamic Revolutionary Court. He was hanged on 15 May 2012 at Tehran's Evin Prison. According to television network Press TV, The Iran Royal Association, an \"obscure\" group seeking the restoration of the monarchy, claimed that its \"Tondar Commandos\" are behind the assassination. The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne claimed \"Iranian media were unusually quick off the mark to report the killing, to show television pictures, and to give the sort of details that usually only emerge after hours, days, or weeks in this secretive state\". An anonymous former senior official expressed doubt about the official account of Alimohammadi's assassination, and expressed concern that the assassination could be used as an excuse for violence against opposition protesters: \"This is an old trick. . . . They did it themselves but blame it on opposition groups so that they can easily begin issuing death sentences for protesters. I think this means there could be more violence against the opposition. \" (See False flag) Opposition groups who monitor Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese movement, in Tehran, claim that a member of Hezbollah, known by his pseudonym \"Abu Nasser\", was photographed at the scene of the explosion in Tehran's affluent Gheytarih suburb. According to Iranian-Israeli analyst Meir Javedanfar, It is \"possible that Mohammadi was assassinated by a foreign intelligence agency\" with the aim of stopping the Iranian nuclear program and also causing embarrassment for the government of Ahmadinejad. Flynt Leverett, director of New America Foundation, said that while it is \"highly unlikely that the United States was directly involved\" in the assassination, it is \"possible that a group or an individual\" who received financial support as part of the $400 million US covert activities program initiated under Bush administration against Iran, might have carried out the assassination. However, Iranian analyst Muhammad Sahimi thinks it unlikely that the murder was directed against Iran's nuclear program as it is engineers, not nuclear physicists, who are \"leading\" that program, and in any case Alimohammadi's research was in the general area of particle physics, \"which is of a fundamental, rather than practical nature\". Ali-Mohammadi was also not under contract with Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to its spokesman Ali Shirzadian, nor was he affiliated with the universities under the control of the Revolutionary Guard (Malek-Ashtar University of Technology and Imam Hossein University). On the other hand, \"a source in Tehran\" told Sahimi that Alimohammadi had worked with the Islamic Revolution Guards \"on several projects in the past,\" and this knowledge combined with the Guard's penchant for exacting vengeance against \"anyone who deserts them and joins the opposition\" adds to \"the suspicion that the hardliners may have had something to do with\" his murder. Al Jazeera reported that authorities on condition of anonymity have confirmed his involvement with Iranian nuclear program. The Economist also quoted anonymous Western sources describing him as \"one of the most important people involved in the [nuclear] programme\". It was also reported that he was a professor at Tehran University's Physics faculty as well as a professor at the IRGC run, Imam Hossein University which houses a physics research center apparently under control of the IRGC. There were also reports of a decapitation program as part of a covert war against Iran, with the aim of assassinating people that are or have been involved with Iranian nuclear program, much like a similar successful program conducted in Iraq, resulting in assassination of hundreds of Iraqi scientists. There were also reports of Israel's involvement in these covert actions, while other reports suggested the creation of a joint assassination team put together by western democracies to neutralize Iranian scientists and engineers. An article in Time magazine claimed that a Western intelligence source confirmed the truth of the confession of Majid Jamali Fashid, who said he assassinated Masoud Alimohammadi on behalf of Mossad, Israel. The source confirmed that Iranian intelligence has cracked one cell trained and equipped by Mossad, and blamed a \"third country\" for exposing the cell.

He was known as a man of resistance throughout his entire life and also as an economist and writer. Ali Alu died on 25 April 2010. Aliu was an activist in the Second World War from 1941 onwards. As a member of the anti-fascist movement, he worked in Albania and in Kosovo. After the Second World War, he continued his activism in liberation movements in Kosovo against the Yugoslav regime, aiming to separate Albanian territories occupied by Yugoslavia and to unite them with the mother state of Albania. He was arrested three times and spent ten years in Yugoslav prisons. Ali Aliu is the father of activist and member of the Assembly of Kosovo, Liburn Aliu, who is also a founding member of Vet\u00ebvendosje! (Movement for Self-Determination). He was known as \"Baca Ali\" (Uncle Ali) by Albanians and a role model and ideological inspiration to many Albanian anti-fascists and activists for self-determination and Albanian National Unification. At his burial, on 26 April 2010, the Kosovo Police, under orders from international EULEX police, tried to arrest Albin Kurti, activist of L\u00ebvizja Vet\u00ebvendosje (Movement for Self-Determination in Kosovo). The people participating in the burial resisted the police and did not allow them to arrest Albin Kurti. Kurti had been at the burial in order to pay his respects and hold a speech on the role of Baca Ali in shaping Albanian resistance. References:"}]
